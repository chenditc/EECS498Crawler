[{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140327110233AARqw12", "answer": "\nDaft Punk; they took electronic music and modified it into something both soulful and electronic. Thus making it pop music.          \nThere are ton of artists that have marked the history of the music,  \nlike Neil Young, Les Paul \nThose two have made a difference in the music. \n \nFor example: Les Paul was the first one to plug an electric guitar and he could make a system where you could record one instrument at the time when all the band had to play at the same time to record the song  \nNeil Young practically created a new genre and he is called the godfather of the Grunge          \nThe answer to that question will depend on the age of the responder.  Elvis & the Beetles have long been touted as the greatest of ALL time; yet both of them were influenced by somebody else that I've never heard of!!!  Personally, I love Stevie Ray Vaughan & he stated that he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix; yet, I don't care much for Hendrix's music!!!  Michael Jackson was also known to be a great talent; but he's another who didn't appeal to me!!!  My Grandmother was a huge Frank Sinatra fan; but we don't hear much of his music unless Michael Buble is on the air.  Buble is know for being a good artist...NOT a great artist.  Generations taste in music change from one to the next; so, I'm NOT convinced that there is any ONE person who I've ever heard of that has had the MOST impact!!!  IF I had to pick ONE, I would say it was the very FIRST person who ever sang the first song because their influence spread from there until now!!!          \nI hate to say this but Justin Beiber has had a massive influence. If not on music, then on how the up and coming generation sees it. The amount of screaming 9 year olds that know everything about him but not Freddie Mercury seem to be the majority. It's not a good thing, but that's the way the media wants to sell it. \n \nIt will probably bring about temporary death of good music until there's another music rebellion like in the 1950's.          \nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini. \nLike a lot of classical musicians, he lived in a music world where everything was about music. Therefore able to create impressive fingerings on the violin rather than just following traditional ways of fingering.  \n \nBut a lot of the older classical musicians were impressive. Their works lasted centuries and will continue to last for a very long time.          \nAfter considerable thought and eliminating several contenders, my opinion is that J\u00a0S\u00a0Bach may have had the greatest influence.\u00a0 He developed counterpoint virtually single-handedly from its crude predecessors.\u00a0 He solved all the basic problems in composition, and modern composers, in the first years after they learn their craft, frequently turn to Bach to \"see how he did it\". \n \nHe's largely responsible even for how we tune our instruments to make complex music playable.\u00a0 Previously, the pitches in the tuning system were based on simple ratios devised by ancient Greeks, called \"just intonation\", which allowed playing in single keys.\u00a0 For example, an instrument tuned for C would sound fine played in that key, but unpleasant played in E. \n \nFor wind and non-fretted sting instruments, where adjusting pitch is possible, the players eliminate the problem.\u00a0 For fixed-fret and keyboard instruments, however, this is not option, and retuning is necessary to play in another key. \n \nBach championed \"equal temperament\" tuning, in which notes are tuned very slightly lower or higher than just intonation would call for, evenly distributing the tuning discrepancies to make possible all keys on fixed-pitch instruments. \n \nThese pitch adjustments are built into electronic instruments, and accomplished on guitar and similar instruments by relocating the frets very slightly from their \"ideal Greek\" single-key placements.\u00a0 Without equal temperament, modern pop and classical music is simply not practicable\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you could play it, but you wouldn't want to hear it.          \nPatti and Mildred J. Hill, the composers of the melody for \"Happy Birthday to You\".          \nBritish Invasion, 80's New Wave/Punk, then rap... There's alot. Depending on time and opinion.          \n\u3000 Now you did ask of Musician only, not plural, or bands or groups, and that changes some attributes to whom we think is our favorite, to who may be most well known attributed artists in the field,  \n \n\u3000 What we miss out on overall , is someone like Beethoven, where without many a written song by him has been keyed upon many thereafter,  \n \nLudwig van Beethoven \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 Thereafter, It would then be individuals alike Elvis and Micheal Jackson,  \n \nElvis Presley \n \nMicheal Jackson,  \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 The list can be longer than any one individual applicable, even unknowns to us from other parts of the world,  \n \nGlenn Miller , Lawrence Welk , Paul McCartney, Elton John,  \nEric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Bob Marley, ... \n \n..          \nMany people consider Paul McCartney the most successful artist of all time, due to the level of popularity his songs co-written with John Lennon have achieved, as well as the amount of singers who have covered his song 'Yesterday', though many would perhaps stick with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, all of them popular in their day and nowadays.          \nObviously the honor should probably go to one of the early classical composers.  However, unless you are a musical historian it would be difficult and too far removed from recent history for the average person to contemplate.  In recent time I would have to say Elvis Presley, even though there are many musicians whom I prefer.  The majority of people within the past half-decade listened to either rock, country, jazz or gospel.  Elvis was the first to take the fledgling genre of rock and combine it with elements of most other genres.   He was among the first to use electric guitar within his band as the backbone to his music.  He was definitely the first  musician of high popularity to incorporate energized movements into his performance.  He also had a wide appeal to people of varying race and musical taste.   Almost all subsequent rock or pop musicians cited him as among their earliest influence.   Twenty years from now most of the nation's or world's populace won't know a clue about current names on the charts.  However, I am certain that even a century and more from now Elvis will still be known (and he might even still have a few 'impersonators' in Vegas.)       \n \nElvis:  the very first rock-n-roll 'star'          \nMichael Jackson, thats all i have to say.          \nOwl City  \nEDIT: 4 dislikes? what do people have against Adam? His music is amazing.  \n          \nScott Joplin had the most impact on popular music as a whole. He was one of the first musicians to incorporate syncopation into music. Doctors of the late 1800s and early 1900s thought syncopation was unhealthy and could cause irregular heart palpitations. Obviously that was proved wrong. \n \nThere's no popular song today without some syncopation in it. Scott Joplin (also known as the \"King of Ragtime\") wrote many famous rags that many people could recognize today, like \"Maple Leaf Rag\" and \"The Entertainer.\" Ragtime gave rise to Jazz, which gave rise to Rock and Roll, which gave rise to Hip Hop, which gave rise to 99% of today's popular music. \n \nIn my opinion, Scott Joplin is the unsung hero of popular music.          \nElvis Presley.He brought people together.He helped to transform basic blues and gospel music and took it to the masses.He had one of the best voices in history.A remarkable vocal range. \nMost of all he made it believable that a kid from an ordinary background could make it.A huge influence on virtually every pop/rock artist since.          \nHiphop now some hiphop I hate. Snoopdog some of his songs are cool. Hiphop express all types of feelings anger, happy, sad, and etc.          \nGive me thumbs down, but i like one direction...          \nJimi Hendrix but I have to agree with LadyMarisaa too          \nMy favourite solo artist is Michael Jackson as far as I'm concerned nobody can or will ever touch his vocal ability or his stagecraft he (in my opinion) was the greatest solo artist ever. As for favourite band there are so many bands that i love to choose from but i have to say Guns N Roses (1986-1996 line-ups) they were the first band i heard when i actually started listening to music when i was about 5 years old and I first heard \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and I was hooked been a gunner ever since and will be till i die (now that's devotion lol)          \ndefintly michial jackson          \n3pac \n \n \n \nHe doesn't give a hoot.          \nWhen you consider music it would largely rule out people like Elvis and Michael Jackson as they are not predominantly musicians - singers, performers, entertainers. \n \nFor a real answer I would pick someone like Antonio Stradivarius for making violins which hundreds of years later are still individually and collectively considered to be the greatest instruments ever made. \nOther than him the great composers like Beethoven whose music is still played today and have inspired great music still being produced for movies today. \nI like the other answerer who said J.S. Bach. \n \nFor more modern influences on music I would pick someone like Elvis or John Lennon.          \nI'm going to have to go with the classical musicians, specifically the likes of Beethoven and Pachelbel.          \nI'll name a few: \nJohnny Cash, Bob Marley, and Gordon Lightfoot. \n \nGordon Lightfoot because his talent of writing songs has inspired my ability to be able to do that. \n \nBob Marley because his music reached deep into my roots to re-aquaint me of my black heritage and struggles. \n \nJohnny Cash because like Marley, his music created a lot of social consciousness in me, plus when I was a kid and I was suffering from a lot of deep problems, listening to Johnny Cash's prison songs really helped me so I can learn about the meaning of redemption from living the low life.          \nThe answer above about J.S. Bach championing the equal temperament tuning is a really good one, but to confine my answer to modern times I would say Phil Spector. Better known as a producer, he was a musician first, so I think he still qualifies.  \n \nOver his career he produced songs and albums for some big pop acts such as The Ronnettes, Tina Turner, The Beatles Let It Be album, The Ramones, John Lennon, Leonard Cohen, and The Righteous Brothers. \n \nNot only was the sound he brought to these songs hugely influential, he is a source of some really wild stories of what takes place behind the scenes in the music industry.          \nBackstreet Boys \n \nThey influenced boy bands to give it a shot. One Direction could have been dumb if BSB didn't create this boy band madness. And their harmonization is excellent.          \nJustin Bieber and One Direction! <33333333 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665          \nI especially agree with Me2 and teandbikkies.  \nHowever there is one that is over looked. This is the one that brought the magical reverbarations of the electric base guitar into the souls of young people in the early 50's. Others had great acts and music, but Duane Eddy (Artistic Name) Whailed out with what was till then only a minor undeveloped instrument.          \nSome bands that have greatly influenced music: \n \n1. The Beatles \n2. Elvis \n3. Jimi Hendrix   \n4. Stevie Ray  \n5. Eric Clapton \n6. Queen \n6. Alice in Chains \n7. Pearl Jam                        \n8. Stone Temple Pilots \n9. Ray Charles \n10. Little Richard \n11. Bob Dylan \n12. The Rolling Stones \n13. Bob Marley \n14. Led Zepplin  \n15. Pink Floyd \netc.  \n \nSome of these artist were true pioneers and creators of Rock n Roll, Grunge, Reggae, etc. \nThese bands are LEGENDS forever their names written in gold. To all the clueless people: \nDaft Punk and One Direction are far from legends, never will be, and can't hold a candle to these artists. No offense, but such a comment is so off the mark it's laughable.  \n \nThese artists created music for the sake of music. Not a quick buck. They didn't pander to the music industries, or the population. They made music straight from the heart and soul. Passion, Aggression, Emotion, that is music.          \ndefintly michial jackson          ", "question": "\n    Suggested \"Question of the Day\" from the community: To most, music is important in your lives.

He is a great guy, and a very sweet boyfriend.  \n \nWhen we first met, I was aware that his mother and step father would often drink a lot, coming home drunk at the weekends. He confided in me that a couple of times his step father had got angry when he was drunk and threatened to punch my boyfriend. My boyfriend has been particularly worried about his mother because during one of her drinking episodes she fell down the stairs and injured her hip, and was hospitalised. \n \nThe other day, myself and boyfriend went for a meal with some friends, and I stopped at his house afterwards. When we fell asleep, we were woken up by his mother and step father coming in drunk and banging around the house and kitchen. We both and work in the morning very early and so my bf went and asked his parents to keep the noise down. His mother was okay with this, but the step father got very angry and threatened to beat my bf up. My bf is much bigger and would definitely beat him, but always just walks away as he isn't violent. His mother ended up crying for the entire night meaning we got no sleep. This is becoming more and more regular and I worry for my boyfriend.
