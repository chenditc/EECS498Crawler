{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140327110233AARqw12", "answer": "\nDaft Punk; they took electronic music and modified it into something both soulful and electronic. Thus making it pop music.          \nThere are ton of artists that have marked the history of the music,  \nlike Neil Young, Les Paul \nThose two have made a difference in the music. \n \nFor example: Les Paul was the first one to plug an electric guitar and he could make a system where you could record one instrument at the time when all the band had to play at the same time to record the song  \nNeil Young practically created a new genre and he is called the godfather of the Grunge          \nThe answer to that question will depend on the age of the responder.  Elvis & the Beetles have long been touted as the greatest of ALL time; yet both of them were influenced by somebody else that I've never heard of!!!  Personally, I love Stevie Ray Vaughan & he stated that he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix; yet, I don't care much for Hendrix's music!!!  Michael Jackson was also known to be a great talent; but he's another who didn't appeal to me!!!  My Grandmother was a huge Frank Sinatra fan; but we don't hear much of his music unless Michael Buble is on the air.  Buble is know for being a good artist...NOT a great artist.  Generations taste in music change from one to the next; so, I'm NOT convinced that there is any ONE person who I've ever heard of that has had the MOST impact!!!  IF I had to pick ONE, I would say it was the very FIRST person who ever sang the first song because their influence spread from there until now!!!          \nI hate to say this but Justin Beiber has had a massive influence. If not on music, then on how the up and coming generation sees it. The amount of screaming 9 year olds that know everything about him but not Freddie Mercury seem to be the majority. It's not a good thing, but that's the way the media wants to sell it. \n \nIt will probably bring about temporary death of good music until there's another music rebellion like in the 1950's.          \nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini. \nLike a lot of classical musicians, he lived in a music world where everything was about music. Therefore able to create impressive fingerings on the violin rather than just following traditional ways of fingering.  \n \nBut a lot of the older classical musicians were impressive. Their works lasted centuries and will continue to last for a very long time.          \nAfter considerable thought and eliminating several contenders, my opinion is that J\u00a0S\u00a0Bach may have had the greatest influence.\u00a0 He developed counterpoint virtually single-handedly from its crude predecessors.\u00a0 He solved all the basic problems in composition, and modern composers, in the first years after they learn their craft, frequently turn to Bach to \"see how he did it\". \n \nHe's largely responsible even for how we tune our instruments to make complex music playable.\u00a0 Previously, the pitches in the tuning system were based on simple ratios devised by ancient Greeks, called \"just intonation\", which allowed playing in single keys.\u00a0 For example, an instrument tuned for C would sound fine played in that key, but unpleasant played in E. \n \nFor wind and non-fretted sting instruments, where adjusting pitch is possible, the players eliminate the problem.\u00a0 For fixed-fret and keyboard instruments, however, this is not option, and retuning is necessary to play in another key. \n \nBach championed \"equal temperament\" tuning, in which notes are tuned very slightly lower or higher than just intonation would call for, evenly distributing the tuning discrepancies to make possible all keys on fixed-pitch instruments. \n \nThese pitch adjustments are built into electronic instruments, and accomplished on guitar and similar instruments by relocating the frets very slightly from their \"ideal Greek\" single-key placements.\u00a0 Without equal temperament, modern pop and classical music is simply not practicable\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you could play it, but you wouldn't want to hear it.          \nPatti and Mildred J. Hill, the composers of the melody for \"Happy Birthday to You\".          \nBritish Invasion, 80's New Wave/Punk, then rap... There's alot. Depending on time and opinion.          \n\u3000 Now you did ask of Musician only, not plural, or bands or groups, and that changes some attributes to whom we think is our favorite, to who may be most well known attributed artists in the field,  \n \n\u3000 What we miss out on overall , is someone like Beethoven, where without many a written song by him has been keyed upon many thereafter,  \n \nLudwig van Beethoven \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 Thereafter, It would then be individuals alike Elvis and Micheal Jackson,  \n \nElvis Presley \n \nMicheal Jackson,  \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 The list can be longer than any one individual applicable, even unknowns to us from other parts of the world,  \n \nGlenn Miller , Lawrence Welk , Paul McCartney, Elton John,  \nEric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Bob Marley, ... \n \n..          \nMany people consider Paul McCartney the most successful artist of all time, due to the level of popularity his songs co-written with John Lennon have achieved, as well as the amount of singers who have covered his song 'Yesterday', though many would perhaps stick with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, all of them popular in their day and nowadays.          \nObviously the honor should probably go to one of the early classical composers.  However, unless you are a musical historian it would be difficult and too far removed from recent history for the average person to contemplate.  In recent time I would have to say Elvis Presley, even though there are many musicians whom I prefer.  The majority of people within the past half-decade listened to either rock, country, jazz or gospel.  Elvis was the first to take the fledgling genre of rock and combine it with elements of most other genres.   He was among the first to use electric guitar within his band as the backbone to his music.  He was definitely the first  musician of high popularity to incorporate energized movements into his performance.  He also had a wide appeal to people of varying race and musical taste.   Almost all subsequent rock or pop musicians cited him as among their earliest influence.   Twenty years from now most of the nation's or world's populace won't know a clue about current names on the charts.  However, I am certain that even a century and more from now Elvis will still be known (and he might even still have a few 'impersonators' in Vegas.)       \n \nElvis:  the very first rock-n-roll 'star'          \nMichael Jackson, thats all i have to say.          \nOwl City  \nEDIT: 4 dislikes? what do people have against Adam? His music is amazing.  \n          \nScott Joplin had the most impact on popular music as a whole. He was one of the first musicians to incorporate syncopation into music. Doctors of the late 1800s and early 1900s thought syncopation was unhealthy and could cause irregular heart palpitations. Obviously that was proved wrong. \n \nThere's no popular song today without some syncopation in it. Scott Joplin (also known as the \"King of Ragtime\") wrote many famous rags that many people could recognize today, like \"Maple Leaf Rag\" and \"The Entertainer.\" Ragtime gave rise to Jazz, which gave rise to Rock and Roll, which gave rise to Hip Hop, which gave rise to 99% of today's popular music. \n \nIn my opinion, Scott Joplin is the unsung hero of popular music.          \nElvis Presley.He brought people together.He helped to transform basic blues and gospel music and took it to the masses.He had one of the best voices in history.A remarkable vocal range. \nMost of all he made it believable that a kid from an ordinary background could make it.A huge influence on virtually every pop/rock artist since.          \nHiphop now some hiphop I hate. Snoopdog some of his songs are cool. Hiphop express all types of feelings anger, happy, sad, and etc.          \nGive me thumbs down, but i like one direction...          \nJimi Hendrix but I have to agree with LadyMarisaa too          \nMy favourite solo artist is Michael Jackson as far as I'm concerned nobody can or will ever touch his vocal ability or his stagecraft he (in my opinion) was the greatest solo artist ever. As for favourite band there are so many bands that i love to choose from but i have to say Guns N Roses (1986-1996 line-ups) they were the first band i heard when i actually started listening to music when i was about 5 years old and I first heard \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and I was hooked been a gunner ever since and will be till i die (now that's devotion lol)          \ndefintly michial jackson          \n3pac \n \n \n \nHe doesn't give a hoot.          \nWhen you consider music it would largely rule out people like Elvis and Michael Jackson as they are not predominantly musicians - singers, performers, entertainers. \n \nFor a real answer I would pick someone like Antonio Stradivarius for making violins which hundreds of years later are still individually and collectively considered to be the greatest instruments ever made. \nOther than him the great composers like Beethoven whose music is still played today and have inspired great music still being produced for movies today. \nI like the other answerer who said J.S. Bach. \n \nFor more modern influences on music I would pick someone like Elvis or John Lennon.          \nI'm going to have to go with the classical musicians, specifically the likes of Beethoven and Pachelbel.          \nI'll name a few: \nJohnny Cash, Bob Marley, and Gordon Lightfoot. \n \nGordon Lightfoot because his talent of writing songs has inspired my ability to be able to do that. \n \nBob Marley because his music reached deep into my roots to re-aquaint me of my black heritage and struggles. \n \nJohnny Cash because like Marley, his music created a lot of social consciousness in me, plus when I was a kid and I was suffering from a lot of deep problems, listening to Johnny Cash's prison songs really helped me so I can learn about the meaning of redemption from living the low life.          \nThe answer above about J.S. Bach championing the equal temperament tuning is a really good one, but to confine my answer to modern times I would say Phil Spector. Better known as a producer, he was a musician first, so I think he still qualifies.  \n \nOver his career he produced songs and albums for some big pop acts such as The Ronnettes, Tina Turner, The Beatles Let It Be album, The Ramones, John Lennon, Leonard Cohen, and The Righteous Brothers. \n \nNot only was the sound he brought to these songs hugely influential, he is a source of some really wild stories of what takes place behind the scenes in the music industry.          \nBackstreet Boys \n \nThey influenced boy bands to give it a shot. One Direction could have been dumb if BSB didn't create this boy band madness. And their harmonization is excellent.          \nJustin Bieber and One Direction! <33333333 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665          \nI especially agree with Me2 and teandbikkies.  \nHowever there is one that is over looked. This is the one that brought the magical reverbarations of the electric base guitar into the souls of young people in the early 50's. Others had great acts and music, but Duane Eddy (Artistic Name) Whailed out with what was till then only a minor undeveloped instrument.          \nSome bands that have greatly influenced music: \n \n1. The Beatles \n2. Elvis \n3. Jimi Hendrix   \n4. Stevie Ray  \n5. Eric Clapton \n6. Queen \n6. Alice in Chains \n7. Pearl Jam                        \n8. Stone Temple Pilots \n9. Ray Charles \n10. Little Richard \n11. Bob Dylan \n12. The Rolling Stones \n13. Bob Marley \n14. Led Zepplin  \n15. Pink Floyd \netc.  \n \nSome of these artist were true pioneers and creators of Rock n Roll, Grunge, Reggae, etc. \nThese bands are LEGENDS forever their names written in gold. To all the clueless people: \nDaft Punk and One Direction are far from legends, never will be, and can't hold a candle to these artists. No offense, but such a comment is so off the mark it's laughable.  \n \nThese artists created music for the sake of music. Not a quick buck. They didn't pander to the music industries, or the population. They made music straight from the heart and soul. Passion, Aggression, Emotion, that is music.          \ndefintly michial jackson          ", "question": "\n    Suggested \"Question of the Day\" from the community: To most, music is important in your lives.

And if you are providing any sort of food for it, it is your problem, especially if you are in a single-family dwelling. That is not to suggest that your landlord should not help you address the problem, but that you need to address the first-cause as well. If you see one mouse, you have many. If you are in a multi-family situation, they could be coming from anywhere including the outside.  \n \nLive traps are best, kill traps second best, glue traps after that. DO NOT use poisons as they are equally toxic to children, pets, and animals that might prey on mice including cats, dogs, owls, ferrets, hawks, foxes, raccoons, badgers and any of several other creatures. A mouse can go through a hole that is 13mm square - pretty small. By excluding one hole they will make another or flank the one. So elimination is the primary removal method. Be scrupulously clean, leave nothing they can eat (including hand soap), and use traps. Bait them with peanut-butter or a combination of sweet chocolate and peanut-butter (they mostly ignore cheese), and ideally get a cat.

If you take them off it will be the end of you both.          \nA new box costs \u00a350-\u00a380 depending on size. Fitting, and a test certificate will cost another \u00a3200 or so, assuming no faults are found in the existing wiring.          \nDo NOT allow your mum's friend to do this work under any circumstances. \n \nYou are very wise not to allow \"anyone\" touch anything electrical in your house. Not only is there a very real risk that the job will be bodged and dangerous; but it is also COMPLETLY ILLEGAL for any unqualified person to do work like replacing the consumer unit (fuse box). You should resist her effort to save money on this - it's one of those times where \"cheap\" could cost lives, and it'll be too late to regret it afterwards. \n \nThe requirements of Part P of the Building Regulations mean that only a certain very limited range of jobs may be done by a \"do-it-yourself\" person. These would be simple things like replacing switches and light fittings. But major work like consumer units and any work in kitchens and bathrooms must be done by qualified and registered electricians. \n \nThe work must be done according to BS7671 and notified to the local authority and it must be tested. A copy of the test certificate must be handed in to the local authority and also to the householder (where it must be kept safe along with insurance certificates and other important documents). \n \nThe consumer unit which a professional will instal could cost between \u00a360 and \u00a3150 depending on its size, features, and how many circuits it is controlling. The actual installation work will involve disconnecting the supply company's protected fuse (an offence in itself if an amature does it), making any house wiring changes to match the new box, fitting the new box, reconnecting the supply company circuit and testing that. The whole thing will take around 2 to 2.5 hours plus the testing time (around 20 minutes), plus registration costs, and VAT. So a charge of about \u00a3350 or so is probably well within the range that should be expected. The \u00a3550 quote is on the high side. An electrician will have to look at your consumer unit (fuse box) location and type before he can give an accurate quote. For such and important and safety critical thing this is worth paying. Only a fool cuts corners with mains electricity. Faults often bite without warning don't give second chances. \n \nYour mum's friend is probably thinking of just the cost of the cheapest consumer unit that he can find, probably from somewhere like B&Q or even second hand. At \u00a340 you are definately getting the cheapest, and he's probably not even accounting for his time. It certainly won't be tested and certified. Not only that but he will be committing at least two criminal offences: disconnecting the supply company's fuse or tampering with the meter (if he does the work \"live\" then he's an even bigger fool), and swapping the consumer unit without complying with Part P.          ", "question": "\n    I'm 17 and very paranoid about electrical work in the house. I'll refuse to let anyone touch a thing unless I believe that they truly know what they're doing.

This will ensure that you can reach the admin server of the old router from any LAN machine, and that the Wireless Clients IPs are assigned correctly. \n \nExample: \n \n- Main Router\u2019s base address is 192.168.1.1, with a DHCP server range of 192.168.1.100  to 192.168.1.150 \n \n- Set the Cable/DSL Router to (the one you're using as an Access Point) base address to any IP address between 192.168.1.151 to 192.168.1.250  \n \nSecond Step:  Switch Off the DHCP on the Wireless Cable/DSL Router, and set to Off any filters or special settings that is On if it is used as the main Router. \n \nPlug the Wireless Router to the main Router. Regular Port to Regular Port, using crossover cable (or straight patch if one port is an Uplink). \n \n The WAN input of the Wireless Router should stay open.  \n \n  Do not connect any thing to the WAN input. \n \nThe LAN\u2019s computers (wired or wireless) should get the IP from one Router only.    \n \nIf  DHCP in on one Router make sure that it  set to provide amount of IPs  that totals the whole system. \n \nThe second Router has to act as a passive switch. \n \nThe result of this arrangement will be a wired Network with wired ports equal to the sum of the two Routers ports \u2013 2, (i.e. two Routers with 4 ports each will yield 6 available wired ports), and a Wireless capacity. \nHTH \nDavid          ", "question": "\n    In my home we have a VM SuperHub which is directly connected to the PC and is used for Wireless Connectivity throughout the home.

Without it being resealed you could be liable for tampering with the electric supply. New Laws 2013.          \nDo NOT allow your mum's friend to do this work under any circumstances. \n \nYou are very wise not to allow \"anyone\" touch anything electrical in your house.  Not only is there a very real risk that the job will be bodged and dangerous; but it is also COMPLETLY ILLEGAL for any unqualified person to do work like replacing the consumer unit (fuse box). You should resist her effort to save money on this - it's one of those times where \"cheap\" could cost lives, and it'll be too late to regret it afterwards. \n \nThe requirements of Part P of the Building Regulations mean that only a certain very limited range of jobs may be done by a \"do-it-yourself\" person. These would be simple things like replacing switches and light fittings. But major work like consumer units and any work in kitchens and bathrooms must be done by qualified and registered electricians.  \n \nThe work must be done according to BS7671 and notified to the local authority and it must be tested. A copy of the test certificate must be handed in to the local authority and also to the householder (where it must be kept safe along with insurance certificates and other important documents).  \n \nThe consumer unit which a professional will instal could cost between \u00a360 and \u00a3150 depending on its size, features, and how many circuits it is controlling. The actual installation work will involve disconnecting the supply company's protected fuse (an offence in itself if an amature does it), making any house wiring changes to match the new box, fitting the new box, reconnecting the supply company circuit and testing that. The whole thing will take around 2 to 2.5 hours plus the testing time (around 20 minutes), plus registration costs, and VAT. So a charge of about \u00a3350 or so is probably well within the range that should be expected. The \u00a3550 quote is on the high side. An electrician will have to look at your consumer unit (fuse box) location and type before he can give an accurate quote. For such and important and safety critical thing this is worth paying. Only a fool cuts corners with mains electricity. Faults often bite without warning don't give second chances. \n \nYour mum's friend is probably thinking of just the cost of the cheapest consumer unit that he can find, probably from somewhere like B&Q or even second hand. At \u00a340 you are definately getting the cheapest, and he's probably not even accounting for his time. It certainly won't be tested and certified. Not only that but he will be committing at least two criminal offences: disconnecting the supply company's fuse or tampering with the meter (if he does the work \"live\" then he's an even bigger fool), and swapping the consumer unit without complying with Part P. \n \nIf this is not done according to the law (Part P) then two things happen: \n \n1) the householder and the person doing the work are committing a criminal offence, with all the consequences following from that (could be a \u00a35,000 fine); \n2) the house property insurance becomes automatically invalid so the insurance company will not pay for any damage caused by electrical fire. \n \nYou should read the Part P leaflet (follow the link below) for a very clear giude as to the what work is legal for an amateur to do. You should also print it for your mum. \n \nEDIT: look in www.checkatrade.com for local electricians. Phone a few and ask for estimates and time scales, discuss the requirements with a qualified human being. It's better than just doing on-line searches.          \nHe can't buy the BOX for \u00a340.

The simple fact that you are asking this question up here shows that you are not mature enough to be drinking in the first place          \nYou'll be fine dude. People have different thresholds when it comes to getting drunk; some need more, some need less. Just drink slowly and don't rush it.  \n \nAlso, if you're drinking spirits, it'll be best to drink with mixers (lemonade/coke/etc) to take the edge of the raw taste of alcohol- and to also stop you from doing shots of alcohol every 5 minutes.  \n \nAnd yes, your mum will probably notice something is going on because you guys will become very relaxed and loud.

It's only really the websites that have torrent files that get caught.

That is just asking for trouble.  The program might be intact but possibly not.          \nWell, it depends where you live. But you also need to understand how they can catch you. Usually, companies that were designed to do this, (like Canipre) start seeding/downloading the torrent along with you and they take all the IP addresses that show up. Then, they present them to the company plaintiff whose copyright was breached and it depends on the company whether they want to put charges. It is easy to get caught because your IP address isnt hidden at all. It is a public information that anyone could get access to.

I'm sure your parents will be ok with it even if they freak out alittle seeing it for the first time. \nAfter all its not like you woke up one morning and said screw it I'm tattooing my face.          \nIf it&#x27;s something that you want to do then do it.

If you talk to them they will tell you no and may be upset. It&#x27;s not hard to hide the tattoo and chances are your friends will like your tattoo and may want one.

What changed?  \nAlso, I don't think this is a matter of your parents, because they will love you no matter what. My mom hated tattoos and was 100% against them.

I think she brought issues to the forefront of her generation as a woman.  Rock had long been a man's world.  I love old movies and my favorite is \"Splendor in the Grass\".  Yes, I have faith in things I cannot see.  \"I Want You to Want Me\".          \nMuddy Waters-created Blues, which Rock evolved out of \r\nChuck Berry-Created Rock \r\nElvis-the biggest rock star at his time who made rock music become widespread \r\nThe Beatles-Obviously a huge influence for rock musicians \r\nJimi Hendrix- redefined what could be done with a guitar, and he invented hard rock.   \r\nBlack Sabbath-the creators of metal \r\nNirvana-brought grunge and alternative into the mainstream.   \r\n \r\nBut Chuck Berry made the biggest impact since he created the entire genre.   \r\n \r\nBQ: Indiana Jones movies (Indy IV was the biggest disappointment ever) \r\nBQ 2: Yes I do because I feel it in other ways.   \r\nBQ 3: I want you to want me          \nHey Nance! \r\n \r\nThe impact John Lennon has made on musicians to this day is extrodinary.

Rock is anchored in blues.

Bring a long cable with you or perhaps the store may have one you can use.  Start with the solid state amps in your price range.  Try to set it the way you like and see how far you can get away from it and still hear it with all of the other sounds in the store, including your drummer. \n \nNow do the same with a tube amp that you can afford.  DO NOT make the mistake of assuming a 50 watt solid state combo is going to be louder that a 25 watt tube combo.  Valve amps send more current to speakers.  They are more efficient.  For example; put and Orange Tiny Terror 15 watt into a 4 x 12 cab.  You would shocked at how well that sounds.          \nIf you're going to play with a drummer, you'll need an amp that's powerful enough to gig with in small clubs.  Even if you have no plans to actually play gigs, you'll need one that's big enough because drummers generally play at gig volume, even at practice.  A good drummer can control their volume, but generally you don't find that type of restraint in inexperienced drummers. \n \nYou can get away with lower wattage ratings if you use a tube amp, but they tend to be expensive. I'm currently gigging with a 22 watt Fender Deluxe Reverb (tube amp) and I generally don't have the volume pushed past 3 or 4.    \n \nSolid state amps are less expensive, but you need a higher watt rating to get enough clean volume. I'd recommend something over 50 watts. My other gigging amp is a Roland Cube 80XL (80 watt) and I highly recommend that. Also consider the Vox VT series.

They were not legally allowed to have relationships with Aryans and were socially isolated, suffering repressions, racist propaganda, and forced sterilization, and non-German black people were sometimes interned in concentration camps alongside Jews or were simply executed.          \nNazis thought of Black people as smart Apes, most people did at the time. \nThe Black cinema worker was in France and probably a descendant of a recent slave. \nNot many Black people immigrated \"willingly\" to Europe if any at all, so it only makes sense he was born there. \n Inglorious Bastards is pure fiction, a snuff fill that really wanted you to hate \"White people\" but under the disguise of a particular group of White people.          \nHitler and the Nazis hates anybody NOT like they were. Actually very similar to the conservatives in America today. The US conservatives are not calling for labor camps, but it is their limited life experiences--they do not travel----their isolation---they live and work in one area----and their lack of an education. There were less than 1% of people in Germany that were black. Today there are a lot more, I was there last May, and the German people, some, a small minority, do not like black people and consider them inferior.          \nHad they the time and if everyone else was not being so resistant they probably would have gotten to everyone sooner or later. It was just that all those darn people out there were giving him a hard time and were just not being cooperative at all.          \nnothing important          \nNo, Hitler also exterminated Black People;there just were not very many so you do not hear much about it. There were several thousand half-Blacks in France which Germany conquered, and who were transported to Malthausen, a sub-camp of Dachau made especially for destroying Black people. Interestingly enough, it was a Black American unit who wound up liberating the few survivors of Malthausen, so Black men from America got to see first-hand what Hitler did to the Black people in the Third Reich.          \n\"a sub-camp of Dachau made especially for destroying Black people\" \n \n Absolute rubbish \"elizabeth\" \n The prime requirement was that they \"undesirable\" not that they were black \n \n\" it was a Black American unit who wound up liberating the few survivors of Malthausen\" \nOh no it wasnt \n   the 1st people into the camp were a squad of 23 US soldiers led by Albert J.

You are 28, you have been there, done that and you know what heartache and sacrifice are. She doesn't. \r\nRight now she's so focused on being hot and meeting guys her age that she isn't thinking about dating a guy 10 years older than her whom she knows her parents will disapprove of. Cut her some slack.  \r\nAt least she has enough respect for herself to not dive into a relationship with you and she's actually pondering what could happen if she did. \r\nIf I were her I would be so concerned about what my parents thought, so maybe she is too.          ", "question": "\n    I'm 28 yrs old, and I met an 18 yr old chick with whom I really click with and started falling for! Before I go on I must first say, that she and I met through a mutual gig in where we both had to sing (we're both musicians). From there we started texting each other a lot- like everyday! That lasted about 2-3 weeks. And in the course of that 2-3 weeks I presented to her other gigs in the hopes that I'd have the opportunity to practice with her, hang out with her, see her and hear her again. We did those gigs and we did enjoy each other's company, flirting here in there. One day we got into a conversation about our love lives, and she mentioned that when she was in high school, she had an \"ideal spouse paper\" that she wrote, and that the qualities that she was looking for in a man remain the same many qualities she listed. She actually let me read the paper, and I kid you not that paper described me- with the exception of the age gap, in which she said the biggest age gap she'd go for was 6 years! That same day, after reading that paper and having that conversation I invited her out for yogurt, and with her being the type (as she says) to \"not beat around the bush\" she calls me out and says that she knows I have feelings for her! I admit it and ask her the same and she also agrees but with doubt due to our age gap. She says she feels weird about the age gap because I'm older than her oldest cousin who is 26 yrs old. (I must say I am 28 but I'm ALWAYS mistaken to be 18-21 =p)  Ever since then we've been talking on the phone endlessly almost every night. She started this thing where she asks me how much I like her on a scale of 1-10 and we tell each other our numbers. One day in June, she out of nowhere says the number doesn't exist for her because she doesn't like me in that way anymore. This is where I got thrown off and am still thrown off. At first I was kind of upset and said that maybe I should just back off, but she was like sad in the sense that she said she would miss talking to me and being my friend. In my part, I said to myself, if I really did genuinely like this girl, it would be hypocritical of me to just stop talking to her and just give up. So we continued on- and it feels like nothing has changed. This is what is confusing me! One day a few weeks back she called me and said she had the urge to call me several times throughout the day and had nothing to say but just wanted to call. (Which I thought was sweet.) She and her cousin came out to my gig to support me. We still talk on the phone endlessly every other night. She gives me really long hugs when we say goodbye (but says I suck at hugging?) The other day she asked me if I had one thing to tell her before she died what would it be? I took a really long time to tell her cuz and started beating around the bush and joked around and suggested that instead of telling her, that I kissed her instead. She was like that could be- but what would you SAY? So I told her I would say \"I love you\". And from there I explained to her that I had fallen for her in that sense. Since this was all on the phone in the wee late hrs of night, she said she was hiding her face in a pillow since she was so flattered.... \r\n \r\nSo I know as a dude- I'm completely oblivious to girls' reactions. I feel like this girl has feelings for me but I know she says otherwise. Could it be she's in denial? Am I looking too deep into it? I really am in love with this girl for many reasons- alot of which I can't explain but makes sense. Female opinions please! =) sorry so longg....

Her song \"Mordred's Lullaby\" is one of my favorites...its about Morgan Lefay, who was supposedly a witch.  \r\n \r\nThe comments go something like this:  \r\n\"Morgan was a witch which means she's evil so she had to be a devil worshipper\" \r\nDo I need to go there?          \nsame here  \r\n \r\nBQ: rough and ready by saxon \r\nBQ2: trolls \r\nBQ3: it's cool \r\nBQ4: satan's fall by mercyful fate          \nI like metalcore,hardcore,etc....

Probably i dont know I have to think \r\nBa3- I agree with you \r\nBa4- I dont know \r\nI hate Hartley by the amity affliction          \n(prog rock) - sometimes can't enjoy less serious types of music \r\n(indie rock) - \"hipsters\", lol \r\n(old music) - say everything new or mainstream sucks \r\n \r\nbq:Nick Drake - Pink Moon \r\nbq2:trolls, obviously \r\nbq3:I agree, though the rank wasn't that interesting          \nRadiohead fans are too serious. Beatles fans don't realise what a douche John was. Shoegaze fans are too depressing.  \r\n \r\nba: nothing.  \r\nba2: too many questions about mainstream music, which I generally despise.  \r\nba3: I've seen more ranty rants in my time.  \r\nba4: something that is hated? you mean like something evil, or a sickness? School's Out by Alice Cooper. Every hates school.          \ni've never really thought about it, but now that you've brought it up, you got me thinking... \r\n \r\nBA: ''in the end'' - linkin' park \r\nBA2: the user ''duck'' \r\nBA3: its cool bro \r\nBA4: idk          \nI like metal, rock, etc, and I hate the elitists (the people who think I'm a dumb f*** for liking slipknot), I hate the music supremacists (the people who bad mouth every other genre without listening to it , especially rap) I hate the kids who only listen to \"core\" stuff and make no attempt to appreciate metal properly, especially the one's who then turn around and say \"why do you hate new metal and only like old bands blah blah blah\" when it has ZERO \r\n relevance to me how new the freakin band is that I'm hating on, I hate the old school fans who constantly complain that there's \"no good metal anymore and it's dying etc\" and that's about it, those are all the people I hate. \r\n \r\nBQ: I was just listening to \"Fear and the nervous system\" which is Munky(from KoRn)'s new band, it's actually really good, it's like a cross between Tool and Korn, it's a nice blend of modern/90's sound. \r\n \r\nBQ2: every time I post a question recommending a band I just found, no one answers the damn question. \r\n \r\nBQ3: I'd be p1ssed off too, but not because he mentioned his age, because he quoted the dumbest and least true phrase ever uttered, \"today's music sucks\". We have the internet for a reason bro, to find new and interesting bands, why not make use of it instead of complaining that music sucks when it doesn't. \r\n \r\nBQ4: \"The politics of ecstasy\" by Nevermore, it's about hating \"the pigs that turn the screws\" ie 'Politicians'          \nI listen to pop punk music, and something that annoys me is that there is a large selection of fans who are \"straight edge\", and they think that makes them superior to people who don't choose the same lifestyle.  Personally, I don't smoke, do drugs, and I VERY RARELY drink, but I would never force my opinion on someone else and I have plenty of friends who do various combinations of all those things.  So many straight edge kids won't even associate with people who aren't just like them.   \r\n \r\nbq: My Friends Over You by New Found Glory \r\nbq2: I don't like that rock and pop are thrown in the same category.  There should be more sub-sections for different types of rock music. \r\nbq3: I completely agree!  \r\nbq4: I Won't Say The Lord's Prayer by The Wonder Years (hating on organized religion...)          \nToday's music is amazing, it's just harder to find. \r\n \r\nI have no pet peeves about the fans, because I listen to the music, not the words of the people who also listen to it. \r\n \r\nBQ: \"Lucid Moments\" - Tune \r\nBQ2: The trolls, most of the time, are mediocre and unentertaining. \r\nBQ3: I used to be like that. Not sure why you'd hate on someone else's opinion, they're probably just trying to be Internetually accepted.. for some reason.  \r\nBQ4: \"Wish You Were Here\" (hatin' on drug addiction)          \nHi Kim  \n \nI love Classical music but the people are annoying as hell the one thing I hate most is when they call everything that's not as complex or sophisticated as Classical \"Pop\" it really pisses me off \n \nAlso I hate it when they refuse to admit that Classical can be used in other genres >:( \n \nAnd I also hate it when Rock fans pick on modern artists without even listening to them because they're not from the 70s  \n \nBQ:Nothing \nBQ2:Its a toss up between the close minded elitists and the angry Atheists  \nBQ3:It was hawt :P \nBQ4:The Needle and the Damage Done-Niel Young          \nIf there is anything that bothers me about fans like that, is they claim to know everything about the band, but only know the songs that come on greatest hit records. But don't truely know the bands music at all.  As on this site, what does one heard the most when someone talks about a certain band or artist, we only hear of things like \"Exile On Main Street\", or a few other albums by said artist, when they also have great abums like, \"Out Of Our Heads\" \"December's Children\", \"Flowers\", which all have some great tunes, just as good as or even better in some cases that albums like \"Exile On Main Street'. You can use my example with any artist you want to choose, and most times end up with the same result. I don't mind that these fans like that certain album or song, but its when they carry on and say things, like this is the only good music that band has ever made. Which shows me, they don't know the band's music at all.  \r\n \r\nbq: Rough Trade - High School Confidential    \r\n \r\nbq2: Things like we should seperate pop from rock. I find people with this mind set, have no love for the sake of music, but there own taste, and that is all that matters to them, and if they want to think along them lines, why not just stay away from this site, if your not happy with the way it is run. For me, I love the way it is all keep together, as one gets to know more about what others like or don't like, and one gets a better feeling or knowing what the other person is all about when it comes to music, I myself love learning what people have interest in when it comes to different styles of music, whether it be metal, rock, blues, jazz, country, folk, rap, R&B, and so on and so on.  I wish others could love music for the sake of music and not just for the genre of music, which is so often shown here, but that I am saying, when people have to put others down for what they like or don't like. I say just sit back and enjoy what you love, without showing any hate towards someone else for their taste in music. \r\n \r\nbq3: What you stated, you said well. \r\n \r\nbq4: Sorry can't think of one at this time. \r\n \r\n \r\ntake care \r\ndave          \nI agree with Luke G's comment about metal fans. You can run into some real snobs and elitists which annoy the hell out of you. \r\n \r\nI also love classic rock, blues and jazz so by some metal-heads standards I'm just a poseur.          \nmetal: \"nu metal, metalcore, and deathcore are NOT metal! blah blah blah blah.\"  \r\ndon't get me wrong, i'm not a fan of any of those genres, but shut the f*ck up! \r\n \r\npunk: \"blah blah blah, you're a poser because your clothes are too clean. You're poser because you don't live on the streets and you didn't grow up in a really poor household and you don't eat out of a trash can. Is that an Adolescents patch? That sh*t's not punk, it's too mainstream.

When you first start watching porn you look at the simple stuff then your mind starts to wounder. I once had the urge to watch fisting. I though it was the most sickest thing ever but i kept watching it. I never seen gay porn thought becasue I tried to not to watch anything with 2 guys in it. Pretty soon i realized enough was enough. Porn was talking over because i was starting to watc even more bizarre things that i dont even want to talk about. I dont know how porn does it but it does. It best for you to try to not watch porn and try not to masturbate so much. Soon you urges will start to fade. But not gonna lie it gonna take some time.          \nFirst off, you need to chill out. Most teenage boys masturbate 1-5 times a day so you&#x27;re perfectly normal (not a porn addict). As long as you&#x27;re looking at girls over 14,  I doubt anyone would say you&#x27;re a pedophile.  \n \nAbout the gay thing, you&#x27;re panicking over something stupid. The fact you had a forced experience when you were younger May have triggered something slightly arousing about it but you&#x27;re not gonna fall in love with a gay person or whatever. Just be you. Do what you want. And I doubt you&#x27;ll end up gay, but if you do, so what? Who cares. Good for you.  \n \nBut because you really like this one girl, you&#x27;re obviously straight. Most girls look at lesbian stuff so, it&#x27;s not all that different. I bet loads of boys are going through what you are, they just don&#x27;t say anything.  \n \nDon&#x27;t panic. You&#x27;ll be fine. You&#x27;re not mental, you&#x27;re a teenage boy.          ", "question": "\n    I'm 13, male, and recently I've been getting urges to masturbate to gay stuff. Sometimes it's the occasional nagging thought while I'm getting off to girls, sometimes it's a full on urge to look at at stuff. The thing is, I'm pretty sure I'm straight. You may say that can't be true, but deep down I believe I am.  \nThis is the cycle I'm talking about, it started about a month ago. (I masturbate once or twice a day to girls/porn, I'm attracted to girls not guys - get an urge to look at gay stuff, or a thought - I always ejaculate to girls - I worry about it - I masturbate once or twice a day to girls... etc.) So what part of the cycle can I remove to stop me worrying? \nI think I'm straight cos I've masturbated to girls for quite a while now, and I'm attracted to them. I feel no arousal looking at a guy, but girls turn me on. I've had 2 girlfriends and hundreds of crushes: there's someone I really like at the moment. Yet these urges persist. \nI had a forced same sex experience when I was younger, no real stuff, just fooling around, but it worries me. When I was younger I read a little gay erotica and had some gay fantasies, but much more straight stuff. I've had some dreams too, that caused me a lot of worry, and some aroused me! But I don't feel any attraction to guys, and it's only these masturbation urges. So what's going on? Is it HOCD, cos I've felt similar fears: fear I was a porn addict, a pedophile, I was terminally ill, gay... I also have a guilt complex, if that helps.  ", "title": "\n    Help?

Her words of comfort and advice are like gold.          \nWhen we are talking to her, she never hears, even if we are in the same room and screaming.  When we are in the basement whispering about her, we hear her screaming about how we always talk about her.          \nwow i didn't notice it until now \r\nbut just by looking at the word \r\nmother i felt my heart break  \r\n.......... now i call that powers ~          \nmy mother has the 6th scence that something is wrong. like being sick or injured in a some type of accident b4 you even begin to tell here.          \nWell, she always had the eyes in the back of her head thing.

She's almost 56 years old and she has recently graduated from nursing school. She has never been married and she raised me on her own, and I'm sure that wasn't easy. She has always worked her a*s off to provide for both of us. Now, not only does she have her own problems to deal with, but she is also helping take care of her disabled sister. I know it probably doesn't sound like much, but I'm pretty impressed.          \nMy mother is capable of similar feats. She has many abilities. Though she has mastered excessive shouting & lack of understanding.          \nShe appears unexpectedly out of nowhere and i might guess she has a super hearing and she has supersonic screams... the mom from hell...          \nsuper-hearing, the ability to throw a shoe with super-human accuracy. super-strength,  stretching powers.          \nTo stand by her children, when we need her most, but at the same time point it out to us if we are in the wrong.She also has the power to make me feel like I use to when I was a kid, even though I'am a mom  now, which is safe and loved no matter what.          \nWow your mom and mine have the same power but mine is 1500 miles away and can always make me feel worse when I'm having a bad day.          \nShe knows everything I am going to do wrong before I even do it and likes to comment on it and She always makes me feel like crap during a visit or a phone conversation. Unfortunately she only lives 6 miles away.          \nmine must have x-ray vision or something.  its like whenever i wanna feel sorry for myself and be alone in my room, she's like \"you need to get out here and quit feeling sorry for yourself\".  its SO annoying!          \nAll of em.  \r\n \r\nShe once carried this girl in here stomach for 9 months, threw up ALOT, had major back pains, couldn't sleep at night, worked, and took care of 3 other children all at the same time and than she shoved me through a 9 cm hole after 48 hours of excurtiating pain all without taking one un natural pain eliminater. Oh yeah she did once more after that. That was just one of her super powers she had.  \r\n \r\nPlenty more though!          \nMines too , she gets me mas all the time sometimes i just wished i do bad things to her , but i just cant!!!!!!!!!

", "question": "\n    I know this may have been asked before, but this question is to hear you answers, and also let my opinions out in the open. \r\nI have several possibilities, and I will first list them, and then explain them all. \r\nThe possibilities are suicide, murder, natural death, or disease. Drug abuse is listed as suicide. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI figure it could be suicide for one main reason: Micheal Jackson's past. If anyone has ever known anything about M.J., they'd know that his life has been filled with pain and abuse, especially in his childhood. He also had to deal with the hardships of burns, skin diseases, as well as false accusations of child molestation. He was guilty of being a bad father, but this was because he was mentally un-stable. You have to at least give him credit for trying to get help for it. \r\n \r\nI know that the second autopsy was said to rule out foul play, but I'd still like to record my thoughts previous to getting the results. Although it is a low percentage, it still might be a possibility. The dosage of his pills could have been raised, or his pills might have even been replaced by something else. For all we know, he might have been slowly being murdered for a month or so now. The autopsy showed that there were slightly dissolved pills in the stomach, but tests have not yet been ran to determine what the pill was, or what concentration it was. Also, the autopsy reported that he might have fell recently... pushed down in rage, perhaps? \r\n \r\nNatural death... well... it still wouldn't have been natural. Any you way you think of it, dying before you are eighty means that something sped it up. Whether it is smoking or pills... dying young is not natural. But it is possible he died 'naturally', even though it was sped up from stress and other various things. I hope this is the conclusion... any other thing is preventable in some ways, so any other conclusion won't please his fans in the least... \r\n \r\nDisease. How many problems did M.J. have again? I can't quite remember, but there is one that sticks in my head completely:  \r\nSkin cancer. \r\nYes, he did have treatment, and had the cells shaved off of his chest, but treatment doesn't always work. How I see it, this is the most logical explanation. He was only having about one meal per day according to the autopsy and witnesses, so I don't think that meant he was healthy. If he didn't die from any of the above things, it is logical to presume that the cancer would have came back and killed him in the end. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAlright, so that is my opinion, so I would like to hear yours. No, he was not killed by Kira, and don't think you are clever by saying that to me. I've heard it before. \r\nToo many times.  ", "title": "\n    What are your opinions on the Micheal Jackson case?

Many of these were collected by men like Francis James Child, but others survived by themselves: \r\n - For Scotland (and a few English songs) people such as the Corries (lovely voices) and Ewan McColl did good renditions of ballads such as Jock O' Braidislee and the Elfin Knight respectively, though their repertoir is not always mediaeval, and may include early modern and some twentieth century folk music. There is also a strong tradition of Gaelic music on the Scottish folk scene, though I'm not as familiar with it as with the stuff in Scots.  \r\n \r\n- Wales also has some good stuff to offer (though generally in Welsh of course), and Carreg Lafar are quite good- their renditions of \"Blewyn Glas\" and \"Can Merthyr\" are rather nice.  \r\n \r\n- English songs, meanwhile, are easily found- they have passed into such common usage that you might already be familiar with songs like \"Lavender's Blue\" and, of course, \"Greensleeves\" (though we are unsure who it was actually written by) and there are soooo many people who have done recordings of them over the years. For more modern renditions, you might want to have a look at Peter, Paul and Mary's version of the \"Three Ravens\", and, of course, Simon and Garfunkel's famous re-working of the popular \"Scarborough Fair\".  \r\n \r\n- Irish music is pretty damn well covered, so you'll have no trouble finding traditional music there- just typing Irish music into Youtube will open you up to a whole genre in the music industry.  \r\n \r\n- For continental music, I'm nowhere near an expert, but there was an album kicking around on Youtube with some songs in Occitan, called \"Music of the Troubadours\". \r\n \r\n- On the religious side of things, this will mostly be apparent in the form of Christmas carols, such as the traditional French Noel Nouvelet, and the Coventry Carol (which was written as part of a mystery play). Many good ones coming from the collection of songs known as Piae Cantiones, and several may have been traditional- songs from this collection have been translated from Latin into English and include Good King Wenceslas. So, again, simply search the title in Youtube and you should find a few good church choirs who sing these. \r\n \r\n \r\nI apologise for going on so long, but hopefully you'll find what you're looking for somewhere in this spiel.  \r\nAs far as I'm aware, Mediaeval Baebes also sing some stuff which isn't what would exactly be termed \"traditional\" as it was written by a fairly well-known composer, but still dates from the Renaissance and Mediaeval periods: \r\n \r\n- There's a large amount of deliberately composed secular music kicking around as well, particularly from the Renaissance decades- John Dowland and Thomas Morley were very good composers, and if you search songs like \"Come Again\" or \"Now is the Month of Maying\" you should be able to find some very good versions, which will have links to other songs. I cannot give you any particular musicians, but you should be able to find some common names on there. \r\n \r\n- If you want choral/religious music, then really what you're be best doing is looking up a couple of mediaeval and Renaissance composers on Wikipedia and typing their name into Youtube- there are often good recordings on there of church music. Thomas Tallis is a good one to start with (Salvator Mundi, Spem in Alium) or Palestrina (Sicut Cervus is very nice).          ", "question": "\n    I adore the medieval baebes and that type of music. Do you know of anyone else, or any similar songs?  ", "title": "\n    Do you know any musicians that play olden-day music, like the medieval baebes?  "},

Yes, I would otherwise society is being groomed by these people to abandon all decency. \n \nThe Government has lost all understanding of law and order, crime and punishment, with the nutters now running the asylum.          \nI have before now found a child looking lost outside a shop.  \nI stayed with him until a policeman arrived, at which point his mother appears from the shop. \nShe knew exactly where he was & who he was with. \nMe, a complete stranger.   \nShe's happy, she can shop without a child under her feet & the shop assistants told me she does the same thing week in, week out, teaching her child to lie if asked has 'he lost his mum'? \nNow days I would if I had time stand & watch for a while but what if I'm busy? \nLike all those people busy filing past 2 little girls & concentrating on a million other things.....catching a train, meeting someone on time, getting to work on time, what to do when they get to work. \nCan't really blame people for their ignorance, we live in a time when getting involved could back fire. \n \nNo good deed goes unpunished.          \nI would certainly be inclined to stop and be very concerned,but I would be worried about 1/ being accused of doing something to them and have your kindness thrown in your face and 2/ That its some kind of begging scam with an older person nearby.I think I would look out for a policeman/woman or similar,and if none around ring the police. Its not very responsible pulling such a stunt especially with girls of only 5 and 7 who are barely old enough to know the point of it all themselves ?          \nYes I would and always have. Those people were incredible, they should all be ashamed.          \nYes I would and have stopped but after hearing that gangs of pickpockets plant a lone child so that they can rush up and rob a person I would be wary now. I would probably now dial 999 and get the police to deal with it. \nWe had it drummed into us as children never to take sweets off of a stranger, go and look at a kitten or puppy or get in a car even if we knew the person. If in trouble to go into a shop or a lady in the street. Sadly though after Hindley and the Moors murders that was a no no. \nA lot of people are scared stiff now of being accused of abuse if they cuddled a frightened lost child or even worse if a man, accused of being a paedophile.  \nWhat a sad world we live in when someone is wary of helping a lost child in case they get robbed or accused of something.          \nI'd keep an eye out, and call the police, having a kid 'play' in the street is how Gypsy gangs rob people in Europe, so helping isn't an option anymore.          \ni found a young boy about 3 years ago in a tower block where i used to live,i took him straight to the concierges a the bottom of the flat i was'nt worried as the lifts are fitted with cctv,but in the street i would be wary.what a sad world we live in...          \nI think it would have to be a woman who stepped in to help. I say that with great sadness as I would hate to see a child suffering but I know only too well there are chances that I would be viewed with suspicion. \n \nOne sordid aspect of the modern world is by default all men are wicked.          \nI would have stopped and called the police          \nNo, because 1, she would blackmail me by saying I raped her.   2, her pimp would jump out with a gun and rob and maybe kill me.   You can pick her up.  I would call 911 and have them take care of her.          \nI think a female could stop and help \na man would have to be extremely careful,  maybe by pointing out the child to a woman passing by.          \nYou have to understand; it was London. \nWould the same have happened in, say, Leeds, or Newcastle. \nAs many have pointed out - society (and the actions of the media) since I've grown up, anyhow, have changed. Both sexes might have been able to 'get away' with asking kids if they were lost, or where their mother was, say 25 or so years ago - but not now. \nWe're British - and we HATE kids as a rule in any case (unless they're ours). The fact that they appear to have 'power' nowadays puts some adults under the cosh; think of them dressing like 'adults', and sneering and sulking if you tell them to 'walk before they can run'. \nI don't know about Brady/Hindley, Angelina - but wasn't people told that Myra a 'rarity'? Throughout the eighties, things were not all that bad, but I suspect the kiddy paranoia happened around the same time as hardship/immigration/crime...and of course nonces were still mostly - as they still are now...despite the late craze of Asian stalkers - Caucasians...and not only that, but close family members (or friends from the next street).          \nAbsolutely.  Just the other day I saw a little boy on a like-a-bike outside the school gates with no adult in charge.  There were a couple of women sitting chatting who had not noticed him and he was clearly a bit lost.  I started talking to him and asked a mum I knew if she recognised him, she didn't, but one of her kids said he was the little brother of a child in the school so I was able to identify his dad.  I stayed with the little lad until we found his dad who had been looking all over the playground for him! \n \nAstonished that people would walk by.  I've watched kids I thought were on their own until I could identify a parent before now and couldn't just walk by.  What if it was my child lost and alone?

Eg. Beats Pro are like \u00a3350 compared to Solo HD which are \u00a3150 and the only thing Pro says it has more is noise cancellation, which im not bothered by and the Solo HD has a microphone built in. The build quality is obviously the factor but is it really worth \u00a3200 more? And Pro and Studio sound identical. \r\n \r\nSecond, Are there any Headphones out there im missing which value for money, are better then beats?

Get to a hospital or a clinic. If it's lots of blood, call 911. Grounded is better than dead and the more you wait, the worse your condition will be and the angrier your mother will be. \n \nI'm sorry to hear you've got a mother like that.          \ntell your mum,  and don't do it again          \nPut pressure on it with a rag.          \nApply pressure to the wound.

EVER! \nMaybe just tell your mom and get some help          \nPut Vaseline over it. Vaseline helps cut off the blood flow. That's what I do.

If you don't notice the bleeding slowing/stopping or you start feeling faint/lightheaded/dizzy, call 911 or get emergency help. I am in your situation, so I take all precautions so I never get caught by my parents.          \nThat should teach you a lesson. It's very stupid to cause harm to yourself. I advise you seeking professional help.          \nI know you don't want your Mom to find out, but you need to. You need help to find a way to deal with what ever is making you feel the need to self harm. It will never get better if you don't. There are people who can help you.

I am availing the exception clause and remain silent.          \ni used to self harm when i was a child up to teenage years. usually after i had been severly scolded by either of my parents, and that was very frequent, im a lot older now and realized that it was becaude i was a bad person and felt guilty and had to punish myself          \nI have been given more in my life than I have ever, or quite possibly will ever, deserve.  Because there is no true cosmic retribution for this, I must inflict my own self-punishment (I also donate a lot of money, so, y'know, I actually help the real world). \r\n \r\nThat, and I feel like a failure.  Which is probably why everyone does it, at their core.  Plus, something about self-harm is...karmically thrilling.          \nHi. I know this isn't answering your question, but please please please stop doing this to yourself. Self-harm won't benefit anyone and will definitely hurt your loved ones more than you. I was a cutter for the last two years and I stopped because I realized that this isn't worth it. Please just stop. Days will get better for you, trust me.          \nTo you and all the self harmers who may see this: \r\n \r\nStart slow \r\nInstead of a razor, put a rubber band around your wrist. Don\u2019t overdo it! \r\n \r\nBuy a punching bag and/or work out daily. \r\n \r\nWrite the names of people you care about where you usually cut. \r\n \r\nTry the Butterfly Project \r\n \r\n \r\nFind something (inanimate!) that you can draw on/rip/etc. \r\nSomething like a doll\u2026 Not a baby because that\u2019s weird o.O \r\nOr copy a picture of someone. Type into Google a star\u2019s name and edit their picture. \r\nAlso not a baby o.O \r\nOr you can just completely draw it from scratch. With the computer or on paper. \r\nMake them look how you see yourself. (Cuts/Burns/Bruises) \r\nWork hard on it! \r\nYou can email it to me if you\u2019d like. I\u2019d love to see your artwork. \r\n \r\nThe picture is solely for seeing what you do. But if you get a doll, it can also make you feel like you have something to take care of.  \r\n \r\nMake a pact with a friend in a similar situation. Like if you have a friend with an eating disorder tell them you won\u2019t cut if they start eating right.  \r\n \r\nMake goals for yourself.  \r\n \r\nBE LOUD!!  \r\nSCREAM!! \r\nWhen no one\u2019s home preferably o.O \r\n \r\nGet out of the house. Meet people. Make friends. Don\u2019t isolate yourself. \r\n \r\nMake yourself laugh.  \r\nDance. Sing. Express yourself. \r\nYou can do it =] \r\n \r\nYou can also call 1-800-273-TALK \r\nOr 1-800-DONT-CUT \r\n \r\nOr visit www.yourlifeyourvoice.org or www.twloha.com \r\n \r\nYou can talk to a counselor here: \r\n \r\n \r\nI\u2019m no professional, but you can email me if you'd like to talk. \r\nPaige_Thomason@yahoo.com \r\nOr add me on Skype \r\nAwkwardTurtleDancer \r\nOr add me on Facebook \r\n  \r\nPlease give me your Yahoo!

Don\u2019t be a victim.          \ni used to do it and the reason was because i felt like the pain that i was feeling with the reality of life all went away wen i felt the real pain of cutting my wrist...          \nHere's my story.. I used to cut myself on my thighs when I was 16-17. I've always been obese, and it really sucked growing up and being made fun of, and being the punchline of people's jokes. I felt so out of control with my life - friends were always disappearing when I needed them, and I felt absolutely hopeless for my future because I was very overweight and just getting bigger (over 300 lbs). I had a false sense of control when I cut, I felt like I could finally be in charge of how I feel. I knew I was in constant torment from bullies and just being a teen, and I wanted to be the one calling the shots. I'd take disposable razors and crack them open with my teeth for the blades. I felt the rush, I felt empowered, but then a few minutes later, all I felt was WEAK, like I knew I was. Then one day, I told myself \"This stops now. If I can't love myself, no one ever will.\" I never cut again, but I can still count around 40-50 scars on my thighs, including where I carved the word \"UGLY\". I am now 22, I have a lapband and I'm losing weight, I'm a nurse, I have a man who loves me, and certainly doesn't find me UGLY - and we are in control of our future, together.  \nSelf-harmers, remember, you are more important than you think, more beautiful/handsome than you know, and more loved than you can imagine.          \nI wouldn't say i'm a self harmer, but i self harmed twice a couple months ago. \r\nMy reasons where purely cause i was depressed or angry.It hurt so much i had to tell my mum and she helped me put some cream on it. I stopped cause i realised how much my mum was affected by that, so i decided to suck up the pain emotionally not physically. Get counselling it helped me a lot and made me less negative and low.          \nI self harm because I want some kind of proof that I can still feel. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its pain. Anything is better than the normal day to day numbness.          \nI self harm because I hate myself.  I am a failure and I deserve it \n I **** everything up and I am just in everybodies way. I also self harm so I can feel something - anything besides how I feel all the time.          \nI went to boarding school and it really fucked me up...that's when I started self harming...I felt alone and worthless, realising how pointless my life is and how insignificant I am....Being trapped with my thoughts drove me insane...crying all the time, isolating myself....self harming helped take that pain away...provided a release from all that I couldn't tell anyone else..          \nBecause I&#x27;m a **** up in life, my family is broken, and I need to feel something.          \nI self harm because it&#x27;s like a way to balance out the emotional pain. Self harming releases endorphins that relieve stress, I have anxiety, so it helps me a lot. I don&#x27;t like doing it, but for now, it&#x27;s my escape. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to punish myself, I just need a release. I also have slight depression, which makes me depressed for no real good reason once in awhile, so it helps that too. My mom cheated on my dad, and home life isn&#x27;t so good, and along with other things I&#x27;m dealing with, so I&#x27;m dealing with a lot right now. So that&#x27;s why I self harm.

It may not say  on the ticket that your need to produce the railcard, but it will certainly say so on the documentation that came with the railcard.          \nYou don't say what type of railcard or whether it is a concessionary railcard or simply a purchased one. \r\nIf you purchased the ticket at a concessionary rate using the railcard (showing to the ticket clerk to get the concession), it is kind of understood that any inspector checking your concessionary ticket will also want to see the railcard as evidence that you are entitled to the concessionary rate. \r\nThis is set out in the terms and conditions for the railcard and is most probably printed on the railcard itself          \nIf you used a railcard to buy it, it will have a railcard code in the top left, second line down if I remember rightly... something like FAM for family railcard 1625 for 16-25 railcard, SNR for senior railcard, and so on. \r\n \r\nThe rule that you need to show your railcard is contained in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage which form part of your contract for all National Rail tickets.          \nRemember this before you send your used ticket to your boyfriend, on the rear of the ticket it will state non transferable, so the moment you send this off to your boyfriend, the place where you bought it from with the time purchased is printed on the ticket, if your boyfriend gets challenged and if they want to delve further into the investigation because he has no railcard they can bring up footage of YOU buying the ticket, you could both be done for fraud and a serious heavy fine, so is a small fee of the price of a ticket really worth the potential fine and criminal record. I check tickets as part of my job and if I find passengers with railcard discounts I ask for the railcard, if they do not have it (especially young persons railcards as these are usually the ones you normally associate with fraudulent use), I will take the ticket off them and make them pay the full standard fare regardless of what time of day, if they refuse to pay there is usually a member of the BTP either on train or at the next station and they don't take to kindly to fare evasion.  \r\nSo please think carefully before you enter into this fraudulent activity, you could affect your future just by trying to save a few quid.          \nIf you buy a ticket with a railcard you must carry the railcard with the ticket and show it if asked by the guard or ticket inspector. \r\n \r\nWithout the railcard it isn't valid and you will be charged the full fare for the journey. \r\n \r\nAnd the others are right, you could also both also be prosecuted for fraud.          \nYou don't state what Railcard you have used if it has the following in the right hand of your ticket.. \r\n \r\nYP = Young Persons/16-25 \r\nFam = Family Railcard \r\nRCD = Forces Railcard \r\nNew = New Deal Railcard \r\nDSB = Disabled \r\nThis will be displayed on the front of the ticket, it does not state on the ticket, but it does on the terms and conditions when you purchased your railcard, that you will at all times carry your railcard, so if the train guard asks your boyfriend for the railcard and he cannot produce he may be liable to pay the full single fare for his journey, plus also train tickets strictly by the book are non transferable, \r\n \r\nIf however he wishes to purchase the same Railcard you have, providing it's not RCD, DSB or NEW then he may be able to use it          \nIf you bought the ticket with a Railcard and its got the railcard code in the top left hand corner i.e. Y-P then the best thing to do would be to get the ticket excessed before the date of travel (excessed means pay the difference between the railcard discounted fare and the non-discounted fare. \r\n \r\nTechnically rail tickets are non-transferable however there's absolutly no way of this being enforced \r\n \r\nHowever if he attempts to use the ticket as it is at present, then he will almost certainly be charged for a new Full price single ticket (the most expensive available) and if he's caught by a Penalty Fare Collector (if travelling in a penalty fare area)  then he could be prosecuted or made to pay double the Full single fare \r\n  \r\nI really wouldn't advise it at all, as there are many methods of getting cheap rail tickets (split ticketing/advance fares/rail rangers/rover tickets) and you could always get the ticket refunded (unless it's an \"advance\" ticket) although it would be subject to a \u00a310 admin fee.

If its sniper vs. dagger, it depends how close you are. 100 meters away, the sniper owns, but 1/2 a meter away, the sniper is skrewed.          \nCompared to a gun a sword is rather slow.  A single pull of the trigger is all that is required to strike while a sword requires a great deal more movement and effort to utilize.  And while anyone who owns a gun should be reasonably well trained, it does not require hours of daily practice to hit a man sized target across the room.  A sword requires a completely different type of skill and greater physical conditioning to utilize with any efficiency. \r\n \r\nAs for style, there are guns engraved and with gold inlays to rival any sword.  I just saw last night were S&W has been commissioned to create two guns for each state with the new state quarters done in gold on eac side of the gun.  Those 100 guns will take more than two years to complete.  The workmanship I saw was excellent.          \nRange, accuracy and precision are important, but a sword takes more training and skill to use, even more so if you are fighting someone else armed with a sword. Swords don't run out of ammo. Swords dont jam.  There is no advantage to decoration with jewels and inscriptions as you said, but you can do the same for a gun. I run my own martial arts school and I am also in the military so I train and use both. I would certainly say the sword takes more skill to use properly and effectively. I can put an M-16 in anyones hand and give them 5 minutes of instruction and they can hit the target, but I cannot do the same with a sword.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110713033754AAf1tQ9", "answer": "\nLook at the TFL website          \nHello  \r\nI think its still called a all day travel card and they cost anywhere from \u00a311.00 to \u00a319.00 check these websites should give you a better idea hope they help. \r\n  \r\n          \nYou need a one-day Travelcard.  It's cheaper if you each get an Oyster card and have a Travelcard put on it.  The number of zones you need depends on where you plan to go. You'll find a map of the zones here.   It's easiest to buy your Oyster card and Travelcard in a newsagents, but they also sell them at train and underground ticket offices.          \nThere's a list of ticket prices for 'Day Anytime' or 'Day Off-Peak' on the link below: \n \n          \nyou should study the TFL website carefully \r\nif necessary send them an email mate...          \nDo you really need an 'all zones' ticket?  If you do, then for one day, an off peak zones 1 - 6 is \u00a38 (travel after 9.30 a.m.) or \u00a315 for before 9.30 a.m. per day. \r\n \r\nThere are tickets which go further out.  Do you really need to travel that far?  Are you sightseeing?  If so, most of the attractions and shopping is in zones 1 - 2 which is \u00a36.60 off peak and \u00a38 peak per day.          \nIt sounds like you're going from outside of London. I'd just suggest buy a London day travelcard from wherever it is that you're going from. That will get you to&around London, as well as back to your home town. \r\n \r\nE.g. I live in Bognor Regis, so I just go on southernrailway.com and get a ticket from bognor to 'london all zones travelcard' which is usually 16-18 pounds. They have a 25% discount online know so should be even cheaper. \r\n \r\nYou can use that travelcard to go on tube and buses around London + to and from london on a train.          \nyou can buy a payg oyster card for \u00a35 then use it for two days.The fare is capped so when it reaches its higher limit you get the rest for free. Then when your finished with it take it back and get your \u00a35 back          \nTry this page from the TFL site: http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14416.aspx It lists all the travel cards and tickets by zone coverage and gives the prices for tickets according to whether you buy a paper ticket or use an Oyster card. The Oyster card costs about \u00a33 I think but can be reused over and over again and you can put travel cards and cash value on there. If you start out with cash value on your card it will cap it at the price of a daily travel card at the end of that day. I hope that makes sense and is helpful. \r\n \r\nhttp://concretemoomin.wordpress.com          \nA one day all zones travelcard costs \u00a38. It is valid on the Underground, buses, London Overground, \r\nNational rail, light rail and trams within the zones 1-6. If you are staying in central London a Zone 1 and 2 travelcard will be sufficient (\u00a36.50)          \nlook at a tube map and see what zone pass you need . you may be better to get an oyster card and just top it up as you need it I know the tube can sometimes get confusing to visitors . have a nice trip          ", "question": "\n    Me and my friends are going to london on the 19th/8th and we were planning to use the london underground to get around. \r\n \r\nBut im a little bit confused about the tickets, as i am trying to find out how much they cost .

No capo, about 4 chords, same chord progression throughout, the strumming pattern is the only thing that changes. linkage:  \r\n \r\nthen just watch one of her acoustic performances on youtube to figure out strumming patterns.  \r\n \r\nand while you're at it, i've found guitarnoise.com to be insanely helpful. You can learn songs by bob dylan, johnny cash, neil young, pink floyd quick and easy, and its really comprehensive and friendly to beginners, aha trust me I'd know, you don't get much more beginner than me lol          \nHEY i just started playing guitar about a week ago and i suggest you get a capo. you can get one for around 10 bucks at target (where i got mine) or any store like that. i only know 1 song so far. it's Billy Currington's People are Crazy. 1st of all if you get a capo you can learn the intro to the song in about 5-10 minutes. you put the capo on the 5th fret and you only use the b string the whole time and 1 g. i suggest you go to freeandeasyguitar.com and look up \"people are crazy\" because the guy teaches you the intro and song real good. when i learned how to play the intro i felt so accomplished lol. its a good way to start off and get a feel of how to play guitar. the song takes more time to learn but if you cant get a capo play the actual song with no capo. theres only 4 chords and they repeat. Again, look the website up its really good. look for the song or look for other beginner songs. if you do look at the video he plays the song capoed so dont get confused. you'll have to look up the uncapoed version separately. hope i didnt confuse u lol. make sure you hold those strings down hard when you play the intro. your fingers will hurt but you'll get used to it. learning the intro makes you better at shifting between chords and makes your fingers used to the irritation from playing so much. so start small from this intro and work your way up to this song and then other songs. HOPE YOU GET A CAPO AND TAKE MY ADVICE BECAUSE THE INTRO TO THIS SONG IS AS EASY AS GUITAR GETS. GOOD LUCK!          \nI've been playing for 4 months, and I'm fairly good. Better than some family relatives who've been playing for a while. You can buy capos in many stores that sell musical instruments. And you know, you don't really need a capo for it to sound just like the song. It just has a slightly lower pitch, you can barely tell if it's like on the 2nd or 3rd fret. But most of Taylor's songs are super easy. Like Our Song, Stay Beautiful, I'd Lie, Tied Together With a Smile, Mary's Song(Oh My My My), The Best Day, A Place in This World, Tim McGraw. Nearly all her songs have only 3 or 4 chords so it's easy to remember. Sorry if you said no Taylor Swift but her songs are most of the ones I play.          \nif you go to ultimate-guitar.com you can find anything you want..ive been playing for a few weeks and im actually pretty good. its really helpful. :) \r\nhappy playing!          \nmost Taylor Swift songs are very easy to play.

However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems.

Although, you may want to book online on the day so that you can pre-book a seat and have less worries about ticket office queues and confusion at the station. You will just need to rock up and collect your tickets from one of the machines in the station. I think you need to book 2 hours in advance though so that the tickets have time to be processed ready for picking up.  \r\n \r\nOne other thing, living in Birmingham you're eligible for the two together railcard.

My season ticket cost over \u00a33400 per year to travel on trains that are late, dirty, unairconditioned and now the basterds are going on strike for a week starting the 21st. \r\n \r\nFrankly I stand the lot of them up against the wall and shoot every man Jack of 'em. \r\n \r\nIf the trains in Germany ran like the British ones they'd ACT with Teutonic efficiency to sort them out.          \nare they that expensive, i mean buy a ticket each day and then you will see how cheap the season ticket. well if you want to compare us with Europe remember the french in the past were spending 7 times as much on there railways. at the same time the tory government was stopping all investment in our railways so as to make them look like a good investment. and we are still paying the price for this. so next time  david Cameron is on your door step ask him how he will give us railways like the french with out spend very large some of our money. OH! he wants to keep our taxes down. you have to pay one way or another so get a life. so more tax better trains schools health service etc less tax you will have to pay some when. \r\nso please let me know who has the answer i will vote for them but if you want better quality of life so do the workers on the railways, health service \r\n bin men, etc so don't expect them to work for pennies.          \nActually they are losing money on season tickets. That means that they lose revenue by keeping a seat open for you instead of selling it repeatedly.          \ntell me about it, i live in london, go uni in cambridge, 3 days a week, even with a student rail, which they do not accept cos i wud have to travel early in order to get uni in time. it will cost me \u00a320 for a return. your spot on mate. so expensive. rails are just ripoffs          \nWe have some of the most expensive peak hour fares in Europe certainly and they need to be reduced. We also have some of the cheapest advance purchase leisure fares in Europe and certainly one of the densest and most frequent networks in Europe. Governments do nothing but screw more and more money out of people to employ more and more lazy civil servants, to fight more and more futile wars etc. Were the railways re-nationalised they'd spend more money on \r\nclosing lines, cutting jobs and making redundancy payments, not on lowering fares.          \nIf you think it's too expensive, why don't you drive a car instead?  Oh, yes, that would be even more expensive.   \r\n \r\nTrains are expensive to operate.  You either pay more to live in London and have an easier commute, or you move away and get a cheaper house and spend money on transport.  You can't have it both ways.          \nSimple supply and demand.  \r\nLots of pepole want to travel at peak times, expanding capacity beyond its current level would needed very expensive works taking years before they had any effect. \r\nReducing the fares on busy commuter lines would just lead to worse overcrowding as there is no space for any more trains.

Not like violent i just mean like how the Punks make fun of Emo and vise versa? If so do you take part in it? \r\nNot at all...I don't really care what other people have to say about my favorite genre. \r\nI'm not going to lie though...I used to always make fun of Nu-metal. =/          \nI never answer any of Man Egg's questions and I've already reported a couple of his questions so I totally agree with you. \r\n \r\n1. For some unknown reason I used to really dislike Radiohead. Then I bought Pablo Honey because of *sighs* Creep. From there on I started to like them more and more and for the past few years they've been one of my fave bands. \r\n \r\n2. Bikini Kill, Breeders, Dinosaur Jr, Public Image Limited, Stone Roses, Husker Du, Joy Division, Minor Threat, Rites Of Spring, Fugazi \r\n \r\n3. Dealing with paparazzi and the constant media attention, \r\n \r\n4. I don't like Bono that much but I do like some of U2's songs. However I still think they're one of the most overrated bands ever. \r\n \r\n5. Not really. \r\n \r\n6. I'm a spoiled only child so I don't have any brothers or sisters. My parents don't listen to much music at all and the little that they do listen to is absolutely horrible. \r\n \r\n7. Just my friends really \r\n \r\n8. Hopefully punk as there aren't really any proper punk bands around. I just wish that Fugazi would come out of hiatus. \r\n \r\n9. When I listen to Twenty Four Hours or Decades by Joy Divison. They're brilliant songs but it's really sad since they were only released two months after the death of Ian Curtis. \r\n \r\n10. I like every genre of music expect for pop and most dance music so I don't really get into fights over genres.          \ni don't really answer those questions anyway..unless they're really amusing..i always wonder why other people even bother. \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now?..not really..some i am unsure of \r\n \r\n2.What bands do you think are not mentioned enough here?

Not like violent i just mean like how the Punks make fun of Emo and vise versa? If so do you take part in it?..well i think paramore/fall out boy/ all this pop punk metalcore crappy emo is rubbish  i don't know if that counts          \n1-Green Day (I thought American Idiot made them too overrated back then) \r\n2 - Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, Gallows, Rancid, NOFX, and some other stuff.  Oh, and I have never seen System of a Down on R&P \r\n3 - Making money while pleasing fans \r\n4 - GN'R (Axl) and Chris Cornell (His new stuff) \r\n5 - Tool and Velvet Revolver.  I don't really hate them, but I'm not used to the sound of Tool and most of Velvet Revolver's songs aren't as cool as GN'R or STP \r\n6 - I don't have siblings \r\n7 - Friends \r\n8 - What else but rock? \r\n9 - Not really \r\n10 - All of rock (and other genres) do that, so that's a yes \r\n \r\nI'd suggest using the Yahoo Answers suggestion board for this too \r\n          \nGood show!  \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now?

", "question": "\n    I know this has been said before but..... \r\n \r\nEveryone knows trolls are just here for attention, a few trolls can be funny but we have way to many here and its making regulars want to leave. I think if we boycott the trolls we can see a 10-40% decrease in trolls for the next few weeks. I think we sould try ignoring them and see how it works. I'm not taking about cool trolls like Fingertoes or Henry Rollins i'm talking about Man Egg and co. So my idea is that we just stop answering Man Egg and cos questions and some of them will go away.I know we report them and they get suspended but they just create new accounts. If we ignore them they might go away. I think most regulars can agree that trolls like Fingertoes and Johnny Rotton are cool because they are creative and witty. But Man Egg and his friends and/or other accounts are not creative. So basically if you want to boycott just do the following... \r\n \r\n1.Dont answer questions by trolls that are uncreative, boring,or tastelessly offensive. \r\n \r\n2.Dont respond to trolls trying to get a reaction out of you by being racist, homophobic etc. \r\n \r\n3.Report man egg type rants. \r\n \r\nSo if you agree please star this question! \r\n \r\nand so this isn't spam here is a mini music survey... \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now? \r\n \r\n2.What bands do you think are not mentioned enough here? \r\n \r\n3.What do you think is the hardest part of being a rock star? \r\n \r\n4.Any artists you try to hate but really like? \r\n \r\n5.Any artists you try to like but really hate? \r\n \r\n6.If you have siblings what music do they like? \r\n \r\n7.besides R&P who do you normally have music conversations with? \r\n \r\n8.What genre do you think will make a comeback in the next decade or two? \r\n \r\n9.Are there any songs/videos/interviews by/of bands you like that make you so sad you cant watch them? \r\n \r\n10.Does your favorite genres fans have tension with other genres fans?

When I was still at university and he was my boyfriend I frequently spent much of my study time daydreaming and fantasizing about him and the life we could create :/ \n12. Lana or Sapphire, because they love Rafa as much as I do! \n13. No I'm enjoying it , sometimes these things ask hard questions and I give up but managing pretty good so far  \n14. To be honest Azarenka was the first top female player I have ever seen wear shorts - they looked good, but I guess I prefer dresses \n15. I do miss Rafa's old style. That is the style o fell in love with, so I will say without sleeves, I love his guns! \n16. Lopez \n17. Don't hate either of them!  \n18. Psychologist - which is what I am. But when I was playing tennis competitively as a child I did hope to break through on the pro circuit.. Injuries and lack of any amazing talent (I was good but not really good) held me back \n19. I really can't stand anyone touching my neck which I think might come from the fact that my biggest fear is that I will suffocate - drowning (though it doesnt stop me swimming) or being strangled or being decapitated really scare me  \n20. As long as it's not one of the unforgivable \n21. Not sure when they will meet again, but the French Open is Rafa's (please just let us have the French or Wimbledon and Nole can have the rest - just let him have one grand slam please :P) \n22. Don't sing in the shower \n23. About a 3, this survey and bargain hunt are keeping me entertained at the moment - doesn't take much to entertain me it's currently 1.24am here \n24. Is it Nole's favorite number, I'm not really sure \n \n \nI have a question for you? What did you think about the woman who snatched Nole's shirt off that young girl at the Australia Open after the final? \n \n \nEDIT just read somewhere that the lady who snatched it auctioned it for charity and the young girl got the shirt back, I'm glas she got the **** but she shouldn't of hate to pay $5500 for it \n \n          \n1.

It was such a massive contrast looking back, considering how I felt nothing for it, yet now I lurrrv it. \n \n2. What was your first thought when you came on Tennis Section? I don't know.

Probably you since your the nicest. Luka because hes really chatty and we could talk for hours. I harass cait with Best answers, telling her she's got swag and how swanky she is.  So I think you three. I think I'd annoy Luka and Cait abit though. Maybe florial too, I don't know her very well but we've talked a few times and she seems on level with you in terrms of niceness. Lol what buffoonery did I just type up. Jaaaaaaaaaaysus. Anyway probably you since you is a nice Pisces fish lady.  \n \n \n13. Is this long? :P Not as long as mine :X \n \n14.

Some parts of your journey may not be bookable. \r\n \r\nYou should only have one fare ticket for the outwards journey and one for return and will cover the whole journey,          \nI should think you'd check your routing and booking with the railway.          \nThe 7:10 train probably has the time restriction on the tickets issued because of rush hour crowding on that service. It may not be crowded at Ipswich but it will probably become so later on. The company will try and spread their passenger load across the rush hour period so they specify validity times on advance purchase tickets. These are often accompanied by compulsory seat reservations. \r\n \r\nYour earlier train is outside of peak travel period and so no time restriction or reservation is required. The 05:30 time is recommended because it will be the service that makes best connection with the 07:10. You could probably catch an earlier one if it exists and you are in time.          \nThey only print the main train time you will be using, mainly due to room on the ticket (assuming a credit card sized ticket) and restricted use. If you have a seat reservation and/or an advanced ticket, you should also get the seat reservation details and train time details for all the trains on a separate printed \"ticket\" sized piece of paper.

They can't grab something that was already theirs to begin with for like hundreds of years          \nIt's just like when you ask why US doesn't want to give New Mexico back to Mexico.

They plug straight into the headphone jack on the TV.  \r\n \r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-X-540-Multimedia-Speaker-System/dp/B000LBHFMO/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1292247907&sr=8-5 \r\n \r\nIf you're looking for something more expensive and powerful have a look at this. \r\n \r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Harman-Kardon-HKTS-7BQ-Cinema-Speaker/dp/B000R923X6/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1292248163&sr=1-8          \nAmazon has a good selection, take a look at Energy, Polk Audio, for good sound at a reasonable price, also Yamaha has some bargain speakers available. also Fluance has a home theater set up that they offer for $199 shipped direct.          \nYour TV might not be able to power external speakers by itself at all much less surround.  You will need to check to see if it has a built in amplifier for external speakers.  Most likely it doesn't.   \r\n \r\nYou didn't mention a budget so I'll just assume it's low.  What you need is an AVR (Receiver) plus speakers.  For higher end receivers I would normally suggest Denon or now days possibly the new Anthem receivers.  For the lower end however, perhaps around $350 I would suggest HK.  I picked up an HK at Frys awhile back for a friend for even less than that and it was quite decent for the money.  Speakers are a little harder to recommend and for small money it's really difficult to find anything that sounds even remotely decent.  This entry level system from Aperion should work well for you however...    It will certainly be a lot better than the TV speakers and a lot better than some of the cheap garbage I frequently see being recommended here on Yahoo.  Some of that cheap stuff will actually sound worse than the TV.  It may sound bigger than the TV and have more bass etc but the frequency response will be so screwed up it will be annoying to listen to.  I know I personally would end up throwing it out the window and just using the TV speakers.  I think a little HK receiver and the Aperion speaker package will probably sound really nice for you. \r\n \r\nmk          \nIf you are looking for good speakers, then never buy Bose, as the first respondent said.  The only thing good about Bose is there are none in my house.  You can buy cheap Radioshack speakers that sound better. \r\n \r\nThat being said, you really need to give a budget to work with here.  That will dictate the speaker quality you can get.  Here are some options under $500. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nYou also need to realize that with any of these speakers, you will need an amplifier (receiver).  Here are some decent entry-level receivers. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIf this is more than your budget, I would recommend shooting for a sound bar like this one. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd keep in mind, with a sound bar, you will not need a receiver.  They have built-in amplifiers.          \nBuying online is not the best thing to do with speakers.  The reason is that you can't listen to them before you buy them.   Listening to speakers is very important because not everyone will agree on what a good sounding speaker is.  You may also find that a fairly inexpensive speaker that sounds crappy to someone else sounds good to  you and is adequate for your needs.   \r\n \r\n I see a few folks recommending Bose.  I would not recommend them simply because they are not a good value for the money spent.   For what you spend on Bose you can get a much better speaker.          \nToday's tv only have an optical audio output which you have to connect to a home theater in a box or a receiver. Those home theater in a box are not very dependable and are not flexible in adding or upgrading. I would recommend looking at an Onkyo HT-S models, it is a separate receiver and a set of speakers (5.1 to 7.1), it is good when you are in a budget. Add a Panasonic blu ray disc player model BD-85 and you will have a pretty good system for around $600. You can demo the system at a Fry's Electronic store with your own ears, make sure you bring your own source of music for the demo. Hope this will help you out.

Twelve is also a highly composite number, the next one being 24. It is the first composite number of the form p2q; a square prime, and also the first member of the (p2) family in this form. 12 has an aliquot sum of 16 (133% in abundance). Accordingly, 12 is the first abundant number (in fact a superabundant number) and demonstrates an 8 member aliquot sequence; {12,16,15,9,4,3,1,0} 12 is the 3rd composite number in the 3-aliquot tree. The only number which has 12 as its aliquot sum is the square 121. Only 2 other square primes are abundant (18 and 20). \r\n \r\nIf an odd perfect number is of the form 12k + 1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.          \nOh no... 6 is the middle of 12!! We're all going to die!!!          \nidk but 2012 is not the end of the world          \nNo, only the numbers 4,8,15,16,23 and 42 mean something          \nIt means one more than 11, nothing more \r\n \r\nespecially since a day is actually 3 minutes less than 24 hours, making the middle of the day 11 something.          \nYes. As far as time goes, it means your location is a certain amount of distant from the sun. As far as the end of the world...that's just a Mayan belief that is a victim of a massive snowball effect.          \nThere were 12 Disciples of Christ just like there are 12 eggs in a carton. \r\n \r\nOne of them was the rotten egg and he was called Judas.          \nit means governmental perfection in Biblical numerics          \nSadly, you can take any Number and make a mystery of it. \r\n \r\nLike.. \r\n \r\n11, everyone has made a mystery of 11 because of the 11:11 phenomenon which is nothing more than coincidence. \r\n \r\nThe same with 4:44, 5:55 and even the famous 666 and 999. \r\n \r\nIt's nothing, just a Number.          \nIt is just a number.  \r\n \r\nHowever, if you are asking about \"Biblical numerology\" : \r\n \r\nBiblical numerology is the study of numbers in the Bible. Two of the most commonly repeated numbers in the Bible are 7 and 40. The number 7 signifies completion or perfection (Genesis 7:2-4; Revelation 1:20). It is often called \u201cGod\u2019s number\u201d since He is the only One who is perfect and complete (Revelation 4:5; 5:1, 5-6). The number 3 is also thought to be the number of divine perfection: The Trinity consists of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \r\n \r\nThe number 40 is often understood as the \u201cnumber of probation or trial.\u201d For example: the Israelites wandered for 40 years (Deuteronomy 8:2-5); Moses was on the mount for 40 days (Exodus 24:18); 40 days were involved in the story of Jonah and Nineveh (Jonah 3:4); Jesus was tempted for 40 days (Matthew 4:2); there were 40 days between Jesus\u2019 resurrection and ascension (Acts 1:3). Another number repeated in the Bible is 4, which is the number of creation: North, South, East, West; four seasons. The number 6 is thought to be the number of man: Man was created on the 6th day; man labors 6 days only. Another example of the Bible using a number to signify something is the number 666, the number of the Antichrist in Revelation chapter 13. \r\n \r\nWhether or not the numbers really do have a significance is still debated in many circles. The Bible definitely seems to use numbers in patterns or to teach a spiritual truth. However, many people put too much significance on \u201cBiblical numerology,\u201d trying to find a special meaning behind every number in the Bible. Often a number in the Bible is simply a number. God does not call us to search for secret meanings, hidden messages, and codes in the Bible. There is more than enough truth in the words and meanings of Scripture to meet all our needs and make us \u201ccomplete and thoroughly equipped for every good work\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16).          \nThe spiritual significance of twelve denotes Governmental perfection. It is the number or factor of all numbers connected with government: whether by Tribes or Apostles, or in measurements of time, or in things which have to do with government in the heavens and the earth.          \ndude you are so wasting my time.....          \nit means 1 dozen          \nIn a Biblical sense it's represents that which is full and complete in an organizational setting. The Holy Bible refers to the \"12 tribes Of Israel\". Jesus Christ had \"12 apostles\". In the book of Revelation chapter 7, the 144,000 chosen ones are sealed from each tribe of  Israel 12,000 apiece. Revelation chapter 12:1 mentions God's \"woman\" in heaven who has a crown of '12 stars' on her head. Revelation chapter 21 mentions heavenly Jerusalem as having 12 gates with an angel at each gate; 12 angels. The wall of the city had 12 foundation stones with the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb. So these organizations whether on earth or in heaven are fully organized and complete.          ", "question": "\n    Okay a few weeks ago I was thinking that 12 is the middle of everything like: \r\n-midnight (12): midnight is the middle of night and day \r\n-noon (12): is between morning, and evening \r\n-2012 (12): the end of the world.  \r\n \r\nI'm just asking if the number 12 means anything? or is it just a number?

I know most of yall are saying \"Yes you should trust her, with out trust there is no relationship.\" But the reason why I question whether I should trust her or not is because she has cheated on me in the past. We have been dating for almost 11 months. But 1 day after our 4month anniversary I trusted her to go to the movies with her girlfriend and 2 other guys. I asked her if anything happen and she tells me this whole story of how the guy was hitting on her ( trying to hold her hand and asking to kiss her) and she kept denying him. I believed her but then herfriend called me and told me that my girlfriend was hugged up with the other guy holding his hand and kissing him. I question her about it and she denied it. After another hour of questioning she tells me the truth and I forgive her. 3 days later she is at her sisters house and she tells me her ex is coming over. Instinctively I ask why and she replies \"My sister invited him\"I told her how I felt about him coming over and she promised she wouldn't do anything. I believed her once again, she also told me she would text and call me to comfort me. So a hour passes after he gets there and no text. So i text her, no reply and I call her no answer. After 5 hours she calls me with the lame excuse saying she lost phone in the couch and I knew she was lying because her girlfriend told me that she was texting her. So i question her and she denies doing anything. Then her girlfriend tells me that they were cuddeling watching a movie on the couch and kissing. I question my girl about it and she denied for 4 days then admited. I havent trusted her since then, what she did to me after our 4month anniversary was heartless. So here we are present day doing pretty good and she hasnt cheated on me as far as I know because she stopped hanging with her girlfriend that told me everything. I have forgiven her for the past but havent forgot. She has been talking to this guy lately on facebook and he is flirting with her. I ask her who he is and she says just this guy she talked to in art class and she didnt really know him. A week later the messages continue so I ask what the deal is with this dude and shes says \" He was like my bestfriend and we are very close\" I reply \"a week ago you said you didnt know him and he was just a guy from art class.\" I also mention that ive known her for 3 years and she never talked about this guy ever! (her supposed bestfriend). So earlier this week she makes a event on facebook called \"Movie night\" She invited 6 of her girlfriends and this one guy to the movies and not me. I question her about it and she says its just a friend thing and im like okay but i dont feel comfortable with him there.She gets all mad at me for not trusting around him and can you blame me? Today I over heard talking on the phone saying how she was going to the movies.. and all the girls she invited are not going besides one of them and this guy is coming and he is bringing a friend. I confront her about it and tell her I dont feel comfortable with her just going with one of her girlfriends and 2 other guys again. She gets mad at me and tells me that I have no trust in her and that im basically insecure. But I tell her that she made me this way but she still insist on  going to the movies. Its like going to the movies with this guy is more important to her than our relationship. I havent got  any sleep tonight because im scared of being hurt again. So my question is should I just chill and let her go because im being over worried. Or do I have a good reason to be concerned and do what ever I can to stop her from going? Idk im just desperate for help I just feel like she is attracted to this guy and he is trying to play the nice guy that listens to her  and gives her compliments. But I also listen to her when ever she needs to talk and I give her compliments constantly even though she doesnt accept them.(She always says its my job to say that or she always talks bad about her self, saying how my compliment is untrue) but when he compliments her shes all like \"ty :)\" or \"awww (then compliments him)\".

If they are working, then these probably are not the speakers for you.  If they are not working, you need to get them repaired or return them. \n \nI bought a pair of Mission floorstanding speakers years ago and I had the same experience.

If you've got the speakers connected to your amp with bell wire, you're strangling their sound. \nTweeter - many owners upgraded the tweeter in the 753, to get an even clearer sound.  Some \"upgrades\" were nothing of the sort.

Not too much -- just some BB cream, a little concealer if I need it, a loose, translucent mineral powder, a little bit of natural-colored eyeshadow, and some mascara. If I'm going somewhere important I'll put on a little foundation and some eyeliner as well.  \r\n18. 18.0 \r\n19. I can be, I suppose, but I'm not.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090119203129AAEMZBh", "answer": "\nI say you're over reacting. Many of my guy friends put their arms around me, but it's in a friendly manner. I wouldn't think too much into it. Yes you should trust your girlfriend.  \r\n \r\nGood Luck          \nIt's not okay for your friends to touch your girlfriend. She's YOUR girlfriend for a reason. But I mean, you can't change the past, all you can do now is talk to both of them and make sure it doesn't happen again.          \nI say that your friend probably likes your gf and is jealous of yall. But that would have made me extremely mad too.          \nwow she's probably cheating on u with your friend but u should talk to her first before deciding on anything she might not be cheating on you there's a 50/50 chance [just talk to her]          \nYour gf maybe didnt want to tell u what he did because she was probably confused as well as u were. But if that was the first time they met and he is so comfortable touching her that way, than u should definitely keep your eyes and ears open for any other suspicious acts. There isnt enough \"evidence\" for you to not trust her yet, just be extra causious on how they act around eachother. Just remember to always follow your gut feeling, if u smell something fishy, keep sniffing! I followed mine and found my bf was talking to other girls.          \nyeah i think you r just over reacting shes your gf you should trust her          \nShe definately liked what yoru friend did. They were flirting..          \nNo i fuc*ed her last nite          \nI wouldn't worry about your girlfriend, it's your friend you need to worry about. \r\n \r\none of the major rules of friendship is No Stealing...as in clothes, music, possessions and significant others. in other words, hands off. he crossed the line by touching her in such an intimate way and the only reason she didn't tell you at first was because she didn't want to make a huge deal out of it and start a fight between you two, not because she had something to hide. she was trying to be a good girlfriend, and you're overanalyzing the whole not waiting for you thing when the bigger picture is the fact his hands were all over your girl.          \nwell man if it seems to me like she is not very loyal in \"your\" eyes \r\nand maybe this situation is not something to stress over to much  \r\nbut maybe you should watch a little bit to see what other things she does with other guys..see if she is trustworthy and if she is not..forget your feelings and dump her          \nyou have a total right to be upset. you should observe what else happens between..or between her and other guys for that matter. and your friend is a dick.          \nYour very jealous dude. dont take offense to me but you wrote a long concerned question over a common thing that happens. when you are not around her i am sure she flirts with other guys too. 99% of women flirt with other guys at work, the store, the mechanic. you got to trust her. if you dont then you become posessive and you become a real drag and a turn off to women. remember, if your a good catch you have nothing to worry about. you must let the bird fly free and not cage it. if it wants to come back it will. if it dont then it dont.          \nYOUR \"FRIEND\" IS AN ASSHOLE. I'm sorry, but he seems the type to try and \"win\" other guy's girlfriends at the first meeting. OF COURSE you trust your girlfriend, she was trying to be nice and not make a scene and this buster put his hands on her and pressured her into going in the club w/o you. He was trying to make you feel small, because he needed to feel big. Sorry, this guy is JERK, don't take him around your gf again, ok?          \ni think that girlfriends should tell their bf about things like that. yeah maybe there's things i haven't told my bf because im scared. maybe she was afraid to tell you that he had touched her like that. yes you are right. we should wait for our bf and the bf should wait for the gf. its a sharing thing. i think that if you really love her then you should trust her and even if she doesn't tell you everything still be there and try to talk to her and let her know that she can talk to you. i think that your friend crossed the line but talk to him and try to see the better things of the whole thing. it will all work out in the end.          \ntell your friend to keep his hands off your girl! i wouldn't go out with both of them at the same time again.  \r\n \r\ngirlfriends should wait for there boyfriends! you are correct!          \nfirst of all if your friend respects you, he would never put his hand on your girl no matter what. at least not in that way.  \r\n \r\nyou should question you friend to see what he says. \r\nno matter what your gf is to blame too. if she didnt like the way he was touching her she would have moved away from him          \ndude your gut is usually right. maybe her intentions weren't bad, you should probably give her the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that she let this dude she hardly knows touch her like that and the fact that she let him dictate what she does knowing you are there should tell you something. she's weak man don't put up with that. talk to your friend about it too. he should agree with you and apologize if he wants to keep it real, if he tries arguing and defending himself...well you can do the math brotha          \nInsecure about yourself and your girlfriend. Take it easy. He might have touched her once but you have her all the time... Be worried if she grabbed on him and denied everything...          \nHonestly, that is not right what your friend did! And further more, if i was the g/f, I would have told him to get his hands off of me! I would have told my b/f ASAP!! I mean, what is she doing not being by your side? I don't think you're over reacting at all! And if it were me, I would start thinking, \"When she goes out w/o me, do other guys touch her? Is she used to this?\" Talk to her about it and see what she thinks. Maybe she doesn't know how to act around a b/f in a club setting? (trying to view both sides). But seriously, sit her down and talk to her about how you felt that night. If she doesn't see that she hurt you, then you need to reconsider your relationship (not meaning break up with her immediately, but just see how she acts for a while). If she can't respect your feelings then maybe she is not the girl for you. Also, talk to your guy friend and let him know how he hurt you. I'm sorry that you had a bad night...I hope this helps!! Good Luck!! :)          ", "question": "\n    So we were all at the front entrance of the club. \r\nMy girlfriend and my friend got pass security first. \r\nWhile i was going through security I notice my friend had his hands on my girlfriends lower back and hips. \r\nI was angry. \r\nThey both walk into the club together and my girlfriend didnot even wait for me. \r\nI later walk in confused...since shouldn't the girlfriend wait for her boyfriend? \r\n \r\nAfter my gf and I left the club, I asked her if my friend touched her. \r\nShe said he did and showed me how he did it.

Try booking now to save money.          \nI have been to Disney World 3 times, and we always get this package for four. But the cheapest hotels are the \"All Star Resorts\".

I think disney would be the best choice because they have packages but if you are staying just in Orlando i think you should check out there condos since there is so many of you.          \nNOTHING is cheap at Disney at christmas time!!!  In fact its the highest priced season.          \nTry travel sites such as travelosity or hotels.com. Also if you are a frequent traveler, use points you have to stay at a hotel for free. There are also hotels that allow you to stay in the park. Also book in advance! Have fun!          \nVillas are cheaper, this website ((below)) is one of the cheapest places to buy in Orlando \r\n \r\n \r\nyou can tell that this is a good deal if you compare it to this: \r\n \r\n \r\n*********GOOD LUCK!!!!****************          \nHere! \r\ngo to yahoo travel! \r\nhttp://travel.yahoo.com/ \r\nClick on hotels then cars! then you get what u want hope this helps          \nLook at this website - you get a full package and its good value: \r\n \r\nwww.travelcitydirect.com \r\n \r\nHave been with them before and they give great service          \nBooked online for my honeymoon.  It was intended to be very romantic.  Discovery was her favorite space shuttle and it was supposed to launch that week.  Unfortunately, Columbia, may her crew have peace, broke apart a few months earlier, so we did not get to watch the launch as planned.  Still, Kennedy Space Center is worth a good day, maybe two if you're into the space program or science in general.   \r\n \r\nRental cars...  Hidden costs are usually the taxes, which are often ridiculous.  If you have good insurance, no big worries.  If not, take the extra insurance they offer.  It's expensive, but an accident can set you back a good bit more.   \r\n \r\nDisney is great.  We surprised ourselves by spending the most time at Epcot.  Not for the attractions, so much, as the food.  The German place, specifically.  Every day, whatever park we were at, we grabbed the monorail back to Epcot for dinner.   \r\n \r\nDon't go between May and September.  Besides the herds of vacationers, it's gawdawful hot and humid.  If that's when you have to go, it's still worth the trip, but get lots of sunscreen and a wide brimmed hat, water bottle, you know, survival gear ;-).   \r\n \r\nWe stayed outside the park, because we went to Universal and KSC, but if we were going to do it again, I think we'd probably have picked one of the park's resorts.  It's not that big of a savings; $15 a day was about the difference for comparable facilities at the time.   \r\n \r\nBTW, if you're interested mostly in rides, spend your days at Universal.  The park is smaller, the rides are closer to each other, there's usually more shade, and it's just more fun that way.   \r\n \r\nAlso, get your speed passes, whatever they are called.  Not standing in line for hours is much more fun than the alternative.   \r\n \r\nOutside of the parks, we ate everywhere from Medieval Tymes, not sure on the spelling, to Wal-Mart.  I think I-Hop had the most consistent food.  Anyway, we never spent more than $25 on dinner, except when it came with a show... or drinks.   \r\n \r\nThe big parks are of course the major part of the days, but you know, we found a great place for mini-golf, an alligator farm (interesting at feeding time), an upside down house and souvenir's up the wazoo.   \r\n \r\nI'm not a big drinker, but there's a whole lotta night life there, too.  If you want the most wholesome night spots, there's Downtown Disney.  Toss back a pint with Hook.   \r\n \r\nOrlando is a great place to spend a few days, or even a couple weeks.  Bring lots of cash, and an emergency credit card, 'cause chances are, the cash will run out before you run out of things to spend it on, and if you don't have any money for the trip home, you may end up working at one of those souvenir shops.   \r\n \r\nAnyway, I do run on, so I'm going to shut up now.  Have a great trip!          \ntry travel city direct          \nFirst, don't go Christmas week if you can avoid it--it is the second busiest week of the year, followed by New Years week.  See this for the weeks of 2009 at Disney World ranked in order:  \r\n \r\nSecond, be aware that kids under three don't count against room capacity limits--which are absolute--and that more than 2 adults incur an extra charge--which I believe is $10 a night. \r\n \r\nThird, your group, if it is truly 6, will not fit into many Disney World resort rooms.  Your best cheap option for 6 is the suites at All-Star Music, which sleep 6--2 in one room with a king bed, and 4 on convertible furniture in a living room.  See this for large families at Walt Disney World:  \r\n \r\nFinally--back to the Xmas week point--that is also the most expensive time of the year, depending on the hotel up to 50% more per night than the weeks just prior.  See this for price seasons at Disney WOrld:  \r\n \r\nHope this helps--if you can, arrive December 5 or 12 instead! Dave          \nchristmas time is an amazing time to go.  \r\nthere's tons of decorations and lights.  \r\nand it evne \"snows\" at night.  \r\ni usually use AAA.  \r\nyou could go to the disney website and customize your trip and book it online or print it out take  it to AAA and see if they can get you a better price.  \r\n \r\n \r\ni personally love disney's pop century hotel. its one of their value hotels. and costs $82 per night.  \r\nall age groups will love this hotel but its got some really cool stuff for kids to walk around and see. (well kids and kids at heart alike actually) \r\nand i'd get the disney dining plan if i was you. you can only get it if you stay at a disney hotel though.  \r\n \r\nalso are you flying? \r\nare you just planning to go to disney and maybe sea world and universal studios and islands of adventure? \r\nif so there is no need for a car.  \r\nas long as you stay at a disney hotel.  \r\ndisney will pick you up at the airport for free and bring you back for free via magical express buses.  \r\nand there are also buses at the hotel that take you fee of charge to the disney parks, water parks, and downtown disney.  \r\nthere are also shuttles provided by sea world and universal studios to take you to those parks.          \nIf you plan on spending a lot of time at the Disney parks, it really pays to stay at a Disney hotel or resort.  Transportation is provided and there are other perks, that save you money.          \nWell, I have a pretty good site for your family to browse through. Friendly service and great value rental homes in the Orlando area.          \nI am going this holiday season as well. We are slated to arrive Dec. 17 and depart Dec. 27. Where are you coming from? Is it remotely near the D.C. area? \r\n \r\nIf it is, consider Amtrak's auto train. They have a train that departs Lorton, VA and travels (no stops) to about 30 miles north of Orlando. We are booked on it --- all 5 of us and a mini van for under $900 round trip! Amazing deal - and, we'll have a car while there to explore Universal, etc. \r\n \r\nWhere are you staying. Have you tried contacting hotels individually? I had a lot of success this way. Instead of buying a package, I've contact individual hotels looking for bargains as you have too big a party to fit in a Budget Hotel. I got a nice, large room at a Moderate Hotel for a Budget Hotel price - simply by asking and being persistent. I'm talking sending letters - the whole enchilada - it helps. \r\n \r\nAlso, we bought our MVMCP tickets now as they sell out fast. This will be our first Christmas there and we are extremely excited. I've taken care of the Train transportation, got the MVMCP tickets, got the hotel, got a few meal reservations - now I just need tickets. \r\n \r\nGood luck. Let me know if you have any more questions. I've been researching this subject extensively and have been in contact with people from  Disney, ABC, Hilton, D.T.D. restaurants and Swan and Dolphin. Reach out and make contacts and go from there.          \nI live in florida and have been to disney countless times. \r\nI suggest you stay in a disney resort.  \r\nIf you stay in a disney resort you can take a bus to the parks so you wouldnt have to rent a car. The bus will take you to all the parks and water parks and down town disney.  \r\nA nice hotel is Coronado Springs. It has a water slide a nice pool and nice rooms.  \r\nGood luck.  \r\nHave a nice trip! \r\nBTW you will be in line for quite a while to get on the rides...

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100804091929AAO4vwe", "answer": "\nThey DON'T \"guard\" EITHER!!!!!!!!!! \r\nRunning in circles,screaming hysterically & biting anything w/in reach is ***********FEAR******!!!! \r\n \r\n\"Resource guarding\" is FEAR & bad-manners. \r\n \r\nDogs can be & ARE trained to \"guard\" objects....see \"ring sport\"....TRAINED,not \"possessive\".          \nMost of the time when I see that question the person asking it has a dog that \"protects\" him from things he doesn't need protecting from....like family members or affection from significant others.  I think its obvious that is not protectiveness but possessiveness. \r\n \r\nPersonally, I don't hold to the idea that an untrained dog will NEVER protect his owner.  When I am working with a foster dog who is giving me grief I have to lock my dogs in the next room, because they will try to \"help\" me by attacking the dog. \r\n \r\nI also had a rough collie who on a couple of occasions defended us from what he perceived to be threats.   \r\n \r\nIMO the problem is that dogs dont know enough to judge when to protect and when not to, and an untrained dog who is protective is likely to read a situation wrongly and create a bigger problem.          \nI agree 100% with Kaper's answer.  I cannot add anything to it.  She is right on.  Excellent answer.          \nI think ms. manners hit the nail on the head. I also think this is a large gray area when it comes to dogs. \r\n \r\nI think dogs are possessive when they are 'protecting' from things that clearly aren't threats. Then again, it could also be that the dog perceives a threat where we don't--or that the dog is merely protecting themselves while the humans stand by. \r\n \r\nI also think that dogs can absolutely protect their owners and/or family members. I had an Aussie cut off a bull that was charging at me when I was younger--I certainly viewed that as protection. Same dog also 'protected' us from a dark object in the night once--she wouldn't let us near, and slowly and carefully worked out what it was. \r\n \r\nTurns out it was a grill cover that had blown over, but that's not the point :)          \nit's not true that only trained dogs are protective.It is true that certain dogs are more protective than others because when  they where originally bred they actually had certain jobs to do.the difference between protective and possessive is the the reason  the dog is doing it.Protecting the house, the owner is for the pack as a whole, their territoryand their pack mates. A pack member is only as strong as it's pack, whereas possessive behavior is for the survival of the individual animal (ex; the ham sandwich,a toy). They're ensuring  their own  survival. although it might sound strange because we're talking about PETS and people want to treat them like humans.dogs don't reason like humans they're animal  so it's important to remember when dealing with dogs, to think like a dog not like a person.protection trained dogs is a whole other subject because they're taking that naturally or bred protective nature and channeling it to a specific task.          \noOo I like this! Lol! \r\n \r\nFirstly, why people are still stuck on \"Only when told\" is beyond me. We run drills where the dog is not given a command and is expected to/taught to respond with his handler in trouble ie the dog exiting the back window of the patrol car should a fight between the handler and a suspect break out at a traffic stop etc. \r\n \r\nBut to answer the question, I don't see it as a dog guarding a resource. I see it as basic pack behavior. In a pack it's everyone's job to warn of danger. It doesn't mean they'll actually bite a flea, it just means that they will all alarm vocally and pester the \"target\" with the threat of violence (think...a bear who approaches a pack of wolves' den with young fuzzy ones around). They're going to collectively make noise and nip. This is what your average every day dog is going to do. \r\n \r\nProtection is not the behavior I've just described. The dog mentioned above, who's alarm barking, maybe even biting, will leave you when you need him most. When he is pushed past his defensive drive's threshold he will run. He simply does not have the confidence learned through dozens of man hours of bitework training to fight a man. He does not have the confidence in his experienced gained from training to feel comfortable in his ability to win a fight. Is a dog who's alarm barking protecting you? No, he's protecting himself, you are valuable to his survival, by warning you, and sticking close, he is looking out for his own interest so to speak...BUT if you can't capitalize on his \"help\" you're dead, he's not going to die for OR with you, he's going to run! \r\n \r\nThe typical dog barking at an intruder is the same as you defending a stranger who's being beaten up on a back street some where. Your natural instinct is to say \"Hey! What's going on!? Cut that out!\"...but if the bad guy pulls out a gun, and you don't have one, and he points it at you, and tells you to get lost? The average reasonable person is going to leave the person who desperately needs their help all alone and go call the cops without risking THEIR safety! Your average every day dog will do the same minus calling the cops! I do NOT call that \"protection\" although it is still indeed a valiant act in todays World where it's possible to get murdered in a street with a dozen witnesses and not have 1 person call 911 or come down to help. A protection trained dog would be akin to an armed off duty police officer...he's going to say \"Hey! What's going on!? Cut that out!\"...but when threatened with a firearm and told to leave now, and when seeing this other person is really getting beat on, he's going to pull his concealed carry weapon with a confidence he gained from practice with a sidearm and the accompanying experience that comes with being a police officer, to be able to eliminate threats and come out alive, and the victor. \r\n \r\nKaper might be scared to death if she has to draw down on somebody, but I assure you she's more comfortable with it than most of the people here...and if one had to pick somebody from Y!A to take along to a possible hostile situation one is going to pick an LEO like Kaper or somebody who's ex-military! Not one of the 15 year olds asking if they should take their dog to the vet if he's been hit by a car, caught on fire, and has bloody diarrhea all at the same time... \r\n  \r\nHope this helps clear it up.  :) \r\n \r\n-edit- Kaper I didn't even look to see who answered this Q I just used your name randomly. I love your answer, the \"If the guy taking your purse hits you or pulls a knife\" thing. Great analogy!          \nPossession guarding is a reaction.  It is a response - usually fear driven. \r\n \r\nProtection is a trained ACTION.  It has nothing to do with fear.          \nWell I can tell you my dogs would do much like most of the reasonable answers here mentioned. \r\n \r\nThey would alarm me, then maybe get possessive or whatever, then right before all hell broke loose, they would be hiding under the couches...lol \r\n \r\nI have Chihuahua's- what do you expect....unless it's a mouse with a knife, they don't stand a chance.  \r\n \r\nBUT I have seen everyday regular PETS that would risk it all for their owner....I had one such dog growing up....he is the ONLY dog I ever had who would have PROTECTED me no matter what, even if it meant his death. \r\n \r\nIn all seriousness, I personally wouldn't rely on any dog to protect me. I'm a grown woman who can handle my business. If & only if, the attacker had a gun, would I comply & even then I would do so waiting for that opportunity to strike out & gain the upper hand. \r\n \r\nI also adore Kaper & Curtis' answers.          \nok i have to disagree with one of your statements, any dog can protect, some dogs are raised to. Anyway, the difference between protectiveness and possessiveness is this; if the dog is protective, he will protect against a threat or what he believes is a threat. Possessiveness is when he wont let ANYTHING near you, threat or not. Hope this helps.          \nDogs can literally grow to become protective of their owners without having been trained to do so. My first guide dog is a prime example. She had a sense of people that some dogs possess & once when we were in a grocery store, one of their men who was working the meat counter kept coming around to me trying to get around my dog & giving me all sorts of compliments even after I asked him to back off b/c I wasn't interested in him & I was married. He didn't listen & became aggressive only when he went to grab my arm, my guide dog barked like mad & nearly took his arm off! IF my guide dog had actually bitten the man, there is a high probability she would have been put down on the guide dog school's say so without waiting for the county to make the call. They're not bred or trained to be aggressive or trained to be protective; it comes from working as a team but some dogs do have the ability to sense a person's intentions & if they are to hurt the handler, the dogs will protect their handler.  \n \nThere was a similar case in New York after a blind woman was mugged despite having a guide dog but what the thief didn't count on was the fact that the guide dog was much like mine & protective of his handler. By the time the mugger jumped at her, the dog had him down & chewed a good portion of his arms, legs, & even his neck area! There was a long drawn out series of meetings as to whether or not to put the guide dog down, which left the dog's handler in such grief she couldn't bear to even go to work, which is understandable b/c not only are these dogs an extension of our bodies, they are our best friends too. We can tell them anything & all we get in return is their love & it doesn't matter if we corrected them or spoke harshly if they did something they knew was wrong - they show unconditional love. I'm sure my guide dog I have currently would act the same in protecting me & esp my youngest daughter b/c they spent the longest time together although my 1st dog was merely months older than she was when I came home with the guide dog. She'd growl if anyone even looked at that child wrong! Often if I couldn't find her in her crib, then her toddler's bed, I always found her in this nice fluffy bed where my guide dog slept & they'd be fast asleep w/my daughter's head on my guide's belly as a pillow & she'd wrapped them both in her favorite blanket she dragged everywhere! But again, there were only 4mos between their ages so they basically grew up together too; I had to retire her early b/c she had such a heavy pull that it was ripping my rotator cuff to the point where I was going to require surgery if I didn't stop working her so I retired her & a sister-in-law & her husband took her in as their pet where she lived a long life & actually passed away several years ago. My current guide dog is already 13yrs old & I fear he doesn't have long left but I can't send him to retire with anyone; my heart just won't let it happen. He was almost scrapped from the program until it came down to 3 blind w/mobility disabilities who he would match well with & it turned out he matched best w/me. He's slower now than before but that's okay b/c I'm slower too & my lumbar spine damage will have me wheelchair bound before much longer so I want as much time to spend with him as possible.  \n \nAs for the guide dog who attacked the mugger, the woman was allowed to keep him; he wasn't put down. The mugger on the other hand was charged with the mugging & he was charged with attacking a service animal, which allowed the judge to add more time on his sentencing for his crime!          ", "question": "\n    Throughout my time in the Y!A dog section, I\u2019ve seen at lot of well-informed, educated answers to the \u201cmy dog protects me\u201d statements on here.  The general response is that only a professionally bred and trained protection dog protects his owner, and only because he\u2019s been told to do so.  All other \u2018protective\u2019 behaviors among pet dogs are really possessiveness.  The dog sees the owner as a resource and is hoarding it from other dogs or possibly even people.   \r\n \r\nWhile I agree with that statement, what is really the difference between the owner\u2019s Old Yeller idea of protection, and the modern trainer\u2019s idea of possessiveness?  If the dog is being possessive, then isn\u2019t it in fact protecting that person from other dogs?  If I protect my ham sandwich from the grabby hands of my sneaky younger brother, I\u2019m being possessive, but aren\u2019t I also being protective of my sandwich?  Say instead I\u2019m defending my purse from a thief- I like my purse and the things in it, say even for sentimental value, so I\u2019m going to hang onto it.  Is that possessiveness or protection? \r\nThere might be a difference then in how the dog views itself in relation to the owner- a dominant dog feels it\u2019s his duty to protect something that\u2019s his, whereas a submissive dog won\u2019t.  However, I\u2019ve seen dogs who are appropriately submissive with humans get between their owner and an aggressive dog.   \r\n \r\nWhat\u2019s going on here, and how is possession guarding really different from \u2018protection?'

The Catholic Church is the true church and founder of the Christian Faith, read this.  \u2014Ecclesiastical history is the scientific investigation and the methodical description of the temporal development of the Church considered as an institution founded by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Ghost for the salvation of mankind.  \r\n \r\nIn a general way the subject matter of history is everything that suffers change owing to its existence in time and space; more particularly, however, it is the genetical or natural development of facts, events, situations, that history contemplates. The principal subject of history is man, since the external changes in his life affect closely his intellectual interests. Objectively speaking, history is the genetical development of the human mind and of human life itself in its various aspects, as it comes before us in series of facts, whether these pertain to individuals, or to the whole human race, or to any of its various groups. Viewed subjectively, history is the apperception and description of this development, and, in the scientific sense, the comprehension of the same set forth in a methodical and systematic manner. The history of mankind may have as many divisions as human life has aspects or sides. Its noblest form is the history of religion, as it developed in the past among the different groups of the human race. Reason shows that there can be only one true religion, based on the true knowledge and the proper worship of the one God. Thanks to the light of revelation we know that this one true religion is the Christian religion, and, since there are different forms of the Christian religion, that the true religion is in particular the one known as Catholic, concrete and visible in the Catholic Church. The history of Christianity, therefore, or more properly the history of the Catholic Church, is the most important and edifying part of the history of religion. Furthermore, the history of religion is necessarily a history of religious associations, since the specifically human, that is, moral\u2014and therefore religious\u2014life, is necessarily social in character. Every religion, therefore, aims naturally at some form of social organization, Christianity all the more so, since it is the highest and most perfect religion. There are three stages in the formation of religious associations:  \r\n \r\n          \nThe Roman Catholic Church is a works based religion, where man must work and cooperate with God to merit salvation. \r\n \r\nThe RCC believes that the authority in the church is the Pope and the Magisterium or the votes of the various church councils along with the Bible.  They teach that they wrote the Bible which any historian will tell you is not true.  The Bible was written mainly by Jews with one or two possible exceptions. \r\n \r\nBible believing Christians, I really dislike the term \"Protestant\", believes that all the works necessary to earn Salvation were done by Jesus for us on the Cross. \r\n \r\nBible believing Christians believe the 66 books of the Bible contain the only authoritative teaching for the church. \r\n \r\nI have a 5 page Word document which I'll send to anyone who asks, which compares the differences between the Bible and what the Roman Catholic Catechism teaches.  This document is annotated with the paragraph numbers from the Catholic Catechism. \r\n \r\nIt's too large to copy and paste here or send by the Yahoo Answers E-mail system.  I'll need your regular E-mail address to send it. \r\n \r\nIn addition, here is a message, taught by John MacArthur, pastor of a large church in southern california whose congregation is composed mostly of former Roman Catholics. \r\n \r\nThis teaching comes in nine parts ranging from 6 to 9 minutes in each part: \r\n \r\nPart 1: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 2: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 3: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 4: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 5: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 6: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 7: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 8: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 9: \r\n \r\n \r\n          \nProtestants: \r\nsola scriptura: the word of the Lord is given in the bible and is complete. \r\n \r\nCatholic: \r\nThe bible is the word of the Lord along with the traditions of men (pope, bishops, priests) which contradicts the bible. \r\n--------------- \r\n \r\n \r\nColossians 2:8  See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.  \r\n          \nThe Roman Catholic Church was founded by Christ who gave the keys of the Kingdom (a symbolic reference to spiritual authority) to Peter. He passed that authority down to his successors, the men we now know as the Popes. The Catholic Faith has the fullness of apostolic authority, including the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation and Penance. No other church has that capacity.  \r\n \r\nThe Catholic Church bases Her doctrine on three things: Scripture, the teachings of the Magisterium (the bishops and theologians of the Church), and Sacred Tradition. Each one must agree with the other two and cannot contradict them in any way. \r\n \r\nDespite what the bigots may try to tell you, Catholics do not worship Mary or statues (idolatry) or place the Pope above Jesus. We do not believe in a \"gospel of works\" because our salvation comes from Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross and nowhere else. Those are simply lies and slander put forth by the ignorant and uninformed. \r\n \r\nProtestantism began with Martin Luther, who objected to certain aspects of the Church. He broke away and began his own church, which has gradually split into hundreds of other denominations -- each with their own interpretation of Scripture. Other than the core belief that Jesus is Lord and Savior, there is no one set of definitive Protestant beliefs. \r\n \r\nMany Protestant churches do claim a belief in \"Sola Scriptura,\" that is, \"By Scripture Alone.\" However, each denomination's version of interpretation of what the Bible teaches differs greatly, accounting for the wide range of practices and beliefs between the various sects. \r\n \r\nUltimately, what Catholicism and Protestantism have in common is their love for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Based on the answers from people like Mike and Pastor Art, I'll let you be the judge of which group is the more tolerant and compassionate of the two.          \nCatholics go to confession. Protistants cut out the middleman and go straight to God. Must be lots of Catholic Brothers and Sisters on here. My wife is Catholic. We disagree about this one.          \nCatholics do not divorce.  Protestants have branched out into a lot of weird fundamentalist churches.  I like the Lutheran church though.                               \nBasically it is doctrinal issues that separate both and this can be seen frequently here on answers and yet outside of this we are no different for all of us are born,suffer and die, and even more fascinating is that we can be quite decent to one another face to face. \r\nI guess the anonymity that a vehicle like answers provides, is a convenient way to vent bias and rage without the consequences! \r\nGod bless.           \nIn the begining of Christian religion, the Roman Catholics ruled the Christian world and the Pope was the 'big wheel' representing God. When King Henry the V111 wanted a divorce, the Pope would'nt give it to him so he started his own Church - The Church of England Anglican). It was very similar to the Roman Catholics except they had a new head guy in England. \r\nThen the Church of Scotland did'nt like the Anglicans taking their money and bossing them around and ruling their affairs so they started the Church of Scotland.. (Germany Luther did't like the Pope making all the rules so he started his own Church. And so on and on it went, Baptists, United, Evangilistics, Mormons, etc.  Then a lot of those religions called themselves reformists and they again changed their biblical beliefs and made new rules.. The major difference is that the Pope has the final say for all the Roman Catholics and the others make their decisions by voting or having elders and Bishops make their rules and biblical interpretations.  \r\n \r\n          \nThe Catholics belong to the Church that Jesus founded.  The Protestants belong to sects that broke away from the Catholic Church. \r\n \r\nCatholics believe in the complete word of God...Bible and Sacred Tradition. \r\n \r\nThe Protestants follow a Bible with incomplete books and disregard Sacred Tradition (teachings of the Apostles), preferring traditions of men (teachings of their pastors) instead. \r\n \r\nCatholics compiled and canonized the Christian Bible.  The Magesterium of the Church (guided by the Holy Spirit) gives the correct interpretation.  Protestants rely on private interpretations of Scripture which is usually erroneous because they are separated from the mystical body of Christ (the Church).          \nGood question but it looks like its impossible to get an unbiased answer.  \r\n \r\nSome of the answers are somewhat right. \r\n \r\nCatholicism, as we know it today, was created by the Emperor Constantine in the 4th century when he brought all ideologies into one faith.  Since then there has been one leader, the Pope, and one apostolic church. \r\n \r\nBasic tenets of Catholicism have been laid out by other answerers but clear differences between C and P are that Catholics: \r\n \r\nUse the priest as the conduit to God.  ie They have confession.  This is a big difference. \r\n \r\nProtestants do not believe in an intercessor for their pleas.  They pray directly to God for forgiveness. \r\n \r\nSome one talked about the elements already.  Protestants believe only that the elements are symbolic of the sacrifice of Jesus.  They do not actually turn to his body and blood. \r\n \r\nThere are a number of answerers who have quoted from revisions in the Catholic religion that were based on the conference we call \"Vatican II\".  These revisions are more like instructions and guidelines than core beliefs.   \r\n \r\nI guess we would all agree that Cs and Ps differ on the importance of Mary.  Obviously, Protestants do not pray the rosary. \r\n \r\nSomeone alluded to the Wittenberg thesis.  These were basic changes that Martin Luther would like to have seen in the Church in his time.  Since the Church did not make the changes and ousted Luther - excommunicated - the Lutheran religion or Protestantism was born.  Obviously the new religion was free to make the changes. \r\n \r\nProtestantism and Catholicism continue to adapt to the changing world.  Each religion needs to battle to continue the edict of Christ when he left us, that we evangelize the world.  Some people believe that people have the right to chose between Chocolate and Vanilla.  Some people would rather have Strawberry.   \r\n \r\nI guess that might be an answer.          \nVirtually none, depending of course on the denomination of Protestant.  The core beliefs are EXACTLY the same.  The differences lie with terminology, semantics, and how certain traditions are recognized and how masses are structured.  There might be differences in decor in the churches.   \r\n \r\nIn my area, we have many Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, and non-denominational churches.  We are really all essentially the same.  What matters is how comfortable you feel in your chosen parish.  As a matter of fact, there's a saying around here that if you're Lutheran, you're practically Catholic, and it's intended as a compliment.            \nfirst of all the bibles are different, the king james is missing books from the old testament. they where taken out, because king james thought that they should be.  however i have read them, and they are indeed holy books that should be included in the bible.  \r\nsecond the Protestants change a lot. while the Catholics have been the same since they became one church some time after christ.  \r\nthe Protestant believe that they should live by the word and only the word, in which they do not, there are women preachers know.  \r\nthe Catholic show a lot of respect for the saints the help carry out the words in the bible. however they are not worship, nether is marry, but the Protestant say that we do. they do not acknowledge the history of the Catholic church, all of the teaching of the saints are not acknowledged.  \r\nthe Catholic believe that marry and the saint are like the angles that watch over us. they can be gods messengers.  \r\nthe Catholic church holds the communion service to be holy, as for the Protestant Churches say that the communion is not in the bread it is received in the heart. which is true, but jesus say for us to do this, so that is the one thing that a church should do.  \r\nand it is taken with win in a Catholic Church, while the Protestant is with grape juice.  \r\nthe Catholics believe the the teaching of st paul, so that is why they have priest. that conduct the mass. while preachers can just get up there and dance in the spirit. i fill more love from god when i am sitting still in my chair, then if i am dancing around and crying. that is human emotions that get out of hand, and not the true spirt of god. people should not be speacking out in church and drawing attention to there selves. but the catholics listen to scripture and that is what god wants. for us to show respect and be silent in church to understand the word, and know that we are small, and he is great. people do not go to church to here others speaking out in mass. that is not showing respect to god. that is being a show clown.           \n \r\nI'll touch on some of the issues where we differ. \r\nBelieve me, I'd run out of room if we go into details,. There are over 33,000 different Protestant denominations in disagreement with each other...  \r\nI'll provide a few links to browes at your leisure. \r\n \r\nCatholics believe the Eucharist is truly the Body & Blood, Not a representation of it. \r\n \r\n \r\nCatholics follow Tradition. The Sacraments that the Apostles practiced. \r\n \r\n \r\nCatholics compiled the Books of the Bible: Protestants have Books Missing. \r\n \r\n \r\nTo validate that the Books Missing Belong: \r\n \r\n \r\nMatthew 23:2-3 \r\n[Jesus speaking] The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice.  \r\nIn the same way, post-Vatican II hierarchs (Breakaways)have authority but are now behaving abominably and corrupting the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church -- those traditions we are commanded to keep:  \r\n \r\n2 Thessalonians 2:15 \r\nTherefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.  \r\n \r\n2 Thessalonians 3:6 \r\nNow we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.  \r\n \r\nOur Lord founded a Church (Matthew 16:18-19), not a book, which was to be the pillar and ground of Truth (1 Timothy 3:15). We can know what this Church teaches by looking not only at Sacred Scripture, but into History and by reading what the earliest Christians have written, what those who've sat on the Chair of Peter have spoken consistently with Scripture and Tradition, and what they've solemnly defined. To believe that the Bible is our only source of Christian Truth is unbiblical and illogical.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThis is a good start. \r\n \r\nPeace be with You. \r\n \r\n(((Joe P))) Then why aren't you following the scripture that call for us to hold to Tradition?          \nCatholics believe the whole Bible, even the parts that are difficult. To be short: Anabaptists (Baptists, non-denominationalists, etc) forbid their infant children to baptized as Jesus instructed. Protestants, after Luther, follow the man-made doctrine of salvation by faith alone, contrary to Jesus' statement that we would all be judged according to our works (Matt 16:27, Rev. 20:13 for ex.) and James' statement that a person is justified by both faith and works together (James 2:17-26).           \nAt one time there was only one Church. in 1054 the Orthodox and Catholic Church split and in the 16th century the Protestant Churches were born. The difference is that the Catholic Church (and Orthodox) both preexisted the NT of the Bible and we use Church Councils to help us understand the faith. Some of those councils decided what books would be in the Bible and what books would be left out. No Catholic or Orthodox would say \"we wrote the Bible\". The Bible is the inspired word of God written by men under the inspiration of God. One of the big differences between us is the way we read Scripture. For Catholics and Orthodox context is extremely important and we spend much more time reading the context of the surrounding Scripture when we consider its meaning. The same applies to subject. I am always amazed when I find out how few Protestant Christians don't know that there are two sets of 10 Commandments and why we each follow different sets. It's in Scripture! The biggest difference comes from the writings of the Fathers of the early Church, those that came immediately after the Apostles. The CC and OC hold them in High regard and use them in helping us understand scripture. They are largely ignored by the Protestant Churches.  \r\nProtestants tend to be totally confused about our beliefs I recently picked up a book about Catholics and Evangelicals in Conversation. From the cover it appeared that it was an honest comparison between Catholic and Evangelical beliefs. When I started to read the \"Catholic\" responses I was shocked at the complete lack of depth and understanding of Catholic Theology. When I read \"About the Authors\" I understood what the problem was. Neither of the authors were Catholic. I still have yet to get any reliable information about Catholics from any Protestant source. The best example is works based religion. It is a complete twisting of our beliefs that is so great that I have a difficult time associating it with my own beliefs.

Free, but takes a lot of time. \r\nTre Mears transportation , they have a web site.          \nProbably won't be warm enough for crop tops [?! - really?] and shorts.

You'll pay for parking, but it will be cheaper than any bus for a group of people.          \nIt may get a little cool at night.  But a pair of sweats (pant and top) to throw on after the sunset will do.  Stay at a Disney resort.  You'll have a much easier time and more enjoyable vacation.          \nIt probably won't be very cold in December, but it will more than likely be too cold for crop tops and shorts. It will be a bit cooler early mornings and after the sun sets, so you will want to bring jeans/pants and some light jackets/hoodies. The middle of the day, with the sun out, will be warmer, so make sure to bring short sleeves, too. \r\n \r\nDo you have your heart set on staying at International Drive? If not, I would definitely recommend staying in a Disney resort. There are several that aren't very expensive, and to me it's so worth it.

And they do loops and are fast and twisty. So with you being like that.... I recommend you don't try them... \r\n \r\nX no way out, is a quite rough backwards ride... I wouldn't recommend it to you either LOL!  \r\n \r\nFlying fish would be good for you, it's a decent thrill, and not too fast either :) \r\n \r\nYou could also try the water rides, like Rumba Rapids or Logger's Leap. They don't spin. :) \r\nAnd, if you really want to, you might try Tidal Wave, a pretty tall water ride, and quite fast, and will DEFINATLY get you wet :P \r\nIt doesn't spin so you probably could try it :)          \nWell I'm sure when you get there you will already know this but DON'T go on these rides if you are easily sick from spinning; \r\n \r\n- Vortex \r\n- Zodiac \r\n- Storm in a Teacup \r\n- Samurai \r\n- Slammer \r\n- Quantum \r\n- Rocky Express \r\n \r\nI also wouldn't recommend rollercoasters to you either, especially Colossus as it does 4 barrel rolls in a row, as shown here;  (it doesn't go fast during that bit, but you might not feel comfortable if you get sick from spinning). \r\n \r\nYou should also avoid upside down coasters, so that rules out Nemesis Inferno and SAW - The Ride.  \r\nAs for X:/ No Way Out, well I'm not sure really. Do you only get sick from spinning alone and not any other type of movement? Because this ride is a backwards indoor rollercoaster, and although it can get quite fast it does do some sharp stops and brakes a lot throughout the ride. To be honest the ride really isn't that enjoyable because of the constant braking, go on it if you want but if the queue is long don't bother! \r\n \r\nSo basically, the rides you are left with are; \r\n- Depth Charge \r\n- Tidal Wave \r\n- Loggers Leap \r\n- Flying Fish \r\n- Detonator \r\n- Rush (doesn't spin but swings you back and forth) \r\n- Stealth (doesn't spin but does have a very fast launch!) \r\n \r\nNot a bad selection of rides; at least you should be able to go on the parks best ride - Stealth! \r\n \r\nHope that helped and have fun! :] (sorry it was a bit long)          \nWell avoid all spinning rides so zodiac, vortex, samurai etc. I know how you feel, I get sick from spinning on everything even wheely chairs :L. With all that n account try the following rides, these are in order of best ride. \r\n1)collosus - a must! \r\n2)rush -another must \r\n3)nemesis \r\n4)saw \r\n5)tidal wave \r\n6) no way out \r\n7)loggers leap \r\n8)detonator \r\n9)slammer (shouldn't make you sick) \r\n11)rapids - if you have time \r\n12)stealth - again if you have time \r\n \r\nThe last 2 rides are not as good as the others, so only do them if you have time (:          \nsaw the ride \r\ncollossus \r\nnemesis inferno \r\nstealth \r\nrush \r\nvortex \r\nslammer \r\ntidal wave \r\ndetonator \r\nno way out \r\nsamurai          ", "question": "\n    To be honest even spinning around or spinning on a chair will make me sick.

The best way to find out one place to another is to go on mapquest.com because it really has valuble information on how to get there. All you have to do is type in the place your at then type in the place you want to drive to then VIOLA!!!! All you have to do from there is drive and navigate. \r\n \r\n-- Have a blessed day!!!! and enjoy your trip :-)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!          \nCall your hotel... from the website there is transportation from OIA to the hotel for $19 one way \r\n \r\n          \nI just stayed at Holiday Inn Sunspree in Orlando because my husband had to catch a flight from Orlando International (MCO). Apparently this hotel had a shuttle service (independent from the hotel)  that could be pre-arranged (not complimentary, but cheaper than a cab). When my husband asked about such arrangements the night before his trip, they told him they didn't have one and proceeded to try to sell him on the idea of going to a timeshare selling presentation. We went to bed with the notion of having the hotel call us a cab in the morning.  \r\n \r\nMoral of the story: press them until you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about. It should have struck us as fishy that they didn't know of any shuttle services, this is one of the biggest tourist destinations in the world after all. BUT make sure you have your shuttle booked in advance and be ready five minutes before they're supposed to be there; they'll happily leave without you. Outside of Disney, in spite of Orlando being a hospitality town, don't expect courtesy or competence from many of the folks you'll run into. Oh, and you'll save about 20 bucks with a shuttle as opposed to a taxi.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100701020522AAbyzMF", "answer": "\ni laughed so hard reading this because i went for 2 weeks....2 weeks ago just got back so i can EASILY answer your questions  \r\n \r\n1.the weather is nice it rains frequently but useally last about 10-15 mins or less. \r\n2. Yes Tons of walking if your going to universal studios they have these walking escalator type things on the ground that help you go faster. I belive they have it for disney world too but thats only at the entrance after you park your car other than that your gonna walk a lot but its WORTH IT. \r\n \r\n3.wear shorts things you would wear in the summer flip flops sandals shorts etc. \r\n \r\nhope this helped          \nI am so excited for you. September and October are great times to go. The weather is hot (but not scorching like the summer) and you will have an amazing time at the theme parks - they are so much fun. Make sure that you comfortable footware. You will walk far if you do Disney parks but there are benches to stop and sit and monorails and trains to help you get around... \r\nTop tip - when you go into the park, even though you'll be tempted to go on the first thing you see and stop to look around - don't do it... have some strength and walk directly to teh back on the park - straight away - get there when it opens... they give you a map, then you will be in the empty bit for at least an hour and wont have to queue for rides, then by the time those people have filtered the back you will be near the front... it's the best way... it's hard to do because you'll want to stop and look at everything as you first walk in - but bite the bullet and just keeping walking. You can get monorail to the EPCOT to se the fire works as night - so you may want to carry a cardigan that evening just in case the temperature drops a bit - but mainly - it's shorts and Tshirts all the way! \r\nHave a magical time - I'm so jealous, I've been 4 times and love it. \r\nDo Seaworld as well and Universal Studios (Islands of Adventure) It's gotta be done. \r\nEnjoy yourselves \r\nx          \nSeptember is nicer than July and August, but is still pretty hot and humid.  You will do a lot of walking when you visit the theme parks, so it's best to wear shorts and a light shirt and comfortable walking shoes.  An umbrella or rain slicker is also useful;  the umbrella can be used for shade even if it doesn't rain.          \nSeptember/October is the best time of year here.  Expect highs in the mid 80's and lows in the low 70's.  Still hot, but not unbearable.  Dress comfortably, shorts and a T-shirt are perfect and are acceptable at almost any restaurant - everyone understands it's a tourist area and everyone has spent the day walking around a hot theme park so there's no need to dress up for dinner. \r\n \r\nBetter than the weather is going to be the crowd levels at the parks, September is one of the slowest times of year.  You'll be able to enjoy lots of short lines and even walk on to some of the big rides with no line at all. \r\n \r\nYou're, unfortunately, missing the best event in Orlando all year by 1 day.  Epcot International Food and Wine Festival starts October 1st.  During the festival they have about a dozen food stands set up around their lagoon that represent different parts of the world.  Each stand has a few small traditional dishes and a couple of local wines and beers available - awesome fun. \r\n \r\nIf you're into scary, then you'll just barely make the beginning of Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights (HHN).  The last weekend of September kicks off their huge Halloween event.  How big is it?  Well, they've already started construction on their ten haunted houses this year!  It's amazing, it's scary, and it's a must see. \r\n \r\nOh, and yes, tons of walking. \r\n \r\nIf you'd like to take a quick peek at a few reviews, some pictures of HHN stuff and where you may be able to grab an adult beverage to relax with then check out this site:          \nI'm in Orlando,Fl right now,and it's hot as hell.But don't worry.Florida is the best place for beaches.And of the course the weather is nice.And your going to Florida 10 days before my birthday:D Sept.27.1994:) \r\n \r\nEnjoy your stay at Florida! \r\n   Jaybree          \nhey , that ' s my birthday ! you might have possibilities w / hurricanes , but it ' s always warm in florida , some parts of the year is warmer than others , yeah , you ' ll have a lot of walking , i recommend a jacket , poncho , t-shirts , shorts , jeans , swimsuits , crocs , tennis shoes , i don ' t really recommend flip flops , undies .          \nFlorida honestly doesn't cool off until around November or December so it might be anywhere from 80-100 degrees in September, depending on hurricanes and such. September is during hurricane season so try to keep an eye on the weather channel and plan around the storms, if we get any. I live in Daytona Beach and have lived in Florida all my life so I'm used to the climate but I know Northerners find the weather ridiculous (as I can imagine). I'd definitely wear shorts and a tank top or loose fitting non heavy fabrics with tennis shoes to Disney. The parks are veryyy large and require lots of walking. Other than the heat, it should be alot of fun :)          \nyeah you will love it you are going at the best time of year we always go in the middle of sept as the schools are back and its alot quieter smaller ques alot of walking yeah most people wear trainers in the parks for the rides dont take dressy clothes for evenong its so casual out their folk just wear shorts etc at night you lucky sod i cant wait to go back u will love it! if u are hirig a car id advise you to go to busch gdns about an hours drive its the best park with lots of rolercoasters          \nThe weather is temperate year round, which I loved. I wouldn't say it's ever too hot, though I'm accustomed to hotter due to the varied places I've lived. It gets humid sometimes, but it's bearable. Shorts and t-shirts are what I wore for close to 10 months out of the year, though I opted for performance polyester (Coolmax, Dri-Fit, etc.). \r\n \r\nSeptember specifically, is one of my favorite times of the year. The color of the grass and trees are all bright. It's a bit cooler than mid-summer, but the days are still long with the sun staying out past 8 PM, and unlikely to get chilly during the night. Bug season lasts a bit longer in Florida, due to all the swamps and lakes and fair weather, so come prepared. \r\n \r\nThe parks are huge. Bring comfortable shoes and don't pack too much for days out in the park. Check the weather--if there's a chance of rain, check the radar/satellite and check the precipitation pattern so you know if you should prepare or go light. I only went once, since it was free for military, but I can definitely say there's little chance of visiting all the attractions of a single park in a day. A large brim hat might be wise if you care enough about your skin. \r\n \r\nRE above: it rarely rained from what I noticed. If it rains, it sprinkles or pours (scattered showers) for a few days and stays clear for weeks or months after. Also, while it's important to monitor for hurricanes, land fall is quite rare. I've only had to evac once in the 6 years living there. I forget which... between 2004-2006 one hit the panhandle area and I evac'd to Orlando. I might have missed some while deployed though.          \nIt will still be hot enough to enjoy the water parks so I wolud take advantage of those.  Wet N Wild is  small Orlando water park but lots of fun.  There are tons of stairs and walking so  make sure to bring water shoes or shoes you're willing to get wet.  \r\n \r\n It still might be raining in the afternoons so if you have a favorite rain coat you'll want to bring that too.  Otherwise you can buy an inexpensive poncho when you arrive. \r\n \r\nClothes should be light and comfortable but for two weeks I would pack a few nights worth of dressy clothes.  For those special nights on the town.  \r\n \r\n Tons of t-shirts and shorts.  Maybe your favorite pair of jeans.  And of course a study pair of flip flops (for around the hotel, pool or place that don't require heavy duty foot wear. \r\n \r\nIn the parks you will need a good pair of walking shoes. \r\n \r\nHave Fun! \r\nBuffy          ", "question": "\n    Hi Im going on Holiday to florida in september... \r\ni have a few questions... \r\n \r\n1 - Im going for two weeks, 17th september, will the weather be nice? \r\n2 - Will there be much walking involved?

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070127041900AAh725n", "answer": "\nIt's peak hurricane season - it's not just rain, but torrential rain and high winds not to mention humid          \nWe went to Orlando in the summer.  You'll be fine!  Yes, you get get torrential downpours in the afternoon, but they are short lived and quite spectacular when accompanied with thunder and lightning.  It doesn't stop you going about your day, you just go get a coffee for hour or have lunch.  So I would say, go!   \r\n \r\nWe had a hurricane once when we were there, though that was at Easter, it was fine...mostly through the night, got up next day, sun beds in the pool etc.  But carried on and went to theme parks.          \nI go to Florida for vacations, usually the First week in September, after kids have gone back to school.  It is hot, steamy hot, and sweltering hot in August and September.  The temps get up to 95 degrees and 95% humidity.   \r\n \r\nWalking and standing on black asphalt all day can get uncomfortable.   \r\n \r\nIf you go mentally prepared, drink a 50-50 mix of Gatorade and water, and stay out of the sun in the early afternoon, you all will have a great time. \r\n \r\nIf you can afford it, rent a full-size or luxury car.  With the cheap, small cars and lots of people in the car, the air conditioning can get overloaded.          \nEvery time I have been in August it has been scorching hot and pretty humid.  It does rain for a few hours about 4 days in 7 but mostly the rain pours down like a monsoon for a bit and then stops - everything dries in an hour or less from the sun and you can resume the day out.   \r\nI have been 3 times in August and it only hailed once, in the evening at that and the stones were the size of popcorn.  Not bad enough to dent a car but bad enough to sting the skin (but nobody walks there anyway). \r\nI'd risk it if that is the only time you can go.  You will get at least 4 or 5 good days if not 9 or 10 and there are lots of great things indoors to see and do.          \ngo somewhere with a less intense august....how about taking the kids to a national park out west? They have amazing things for children to do and it is so much fun. My family always went when we were growing up and I liked it much more than disneyworld! (Grand Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park) \r\n \r\nand btw - I am living in England next fall for school....I def. want to visit Scotland. Any suggestions from a native? :P          \nI would go.  I have been there many times in August.  It is the hottest time of the year and it is hurricane season plus it does rain during the day. \r\n \r\nBut all in all I would still go.  The weather is not too bad to deal except possibly during the middle of the afternoon.  You can always go back to your hotel and swim in the pool, visit one of the water parks or eat indoors if you get too hot.  My recomendation is to stay on Disney property this way you have free transportation to and from your hotel and all Disney parks and the airport which is very cost effective and convenient.  They also sell ice cream and little spray bottles you can fill with water that have fans these help a lot.  I like to buy the waterparks and more option with my Disney pass it is well worth the extra cost.  The water parks are lots of fun and a great way to spend the hot part of the day when you just don't feel like wasting time in your hotel but are too hot at the theme parks. \r\n \r\nAlso if you do go make your dining reservations as soon as you book your trip or if you book it too early then be sure to make them 180 days in advance. \r\n \r\nIf you would like more info on Orlando weather then here's a link           \nPlease do try to go to Orlando at another time because the humidity along with the park queues will darken your views of this totally amazing place.          \nAt least in Scotland it isn't about 100 degrees and 98% relative humidity! \r\n \r\nIt will be hot and humid.  Rain showers almost daily.   \r\n \r\nI would go, but be prepared for the heat with appropriate clothing, lots of sunscreen, good walking shoes, and stay hydrated.   Plan to get to the parks early in the morning.   Stay on Disney property at one of their resorts so you can take mid-day breaks to rest, maybe take a swim, then return to the parks in late afternoon.  At that ime of year, the parks will be open late, so you can stay until bedtime! \r\n \r\nIf you have the time, don't do all the parks at once.  Spread them out over a few days and do other things in between.  I would recommend the Unofficial Guide to Disney.  That book will give you lots of pointers about the best way to see the parks.  Also www.mousebuzz.com has great forums. \r\n \r\nGo to Cape Canaveral while you're there.  Enjoy your trip! \r\n \r\nBTW:  Disneyland is in California.  Disney World is in Orlando.          \ni have been living in orlando florida for over 7 years the time of the year that you want to come is just fine, yes it rains but mostly in the evening aroung 4:00 or 5:00 for about 1 hour and then its stops, the air smells so fresh after the rain, i love it, its just part of florida. Disney has alot of indoor activities as well so in the morning and afternnon you can walk around the park and ride the rides outside and then if it rains you can do the indoor shows and rides.  I work in the hospitality industry so trust me i know a whole lot about all florida theme parks. You will have a great time in orlando florida. Try to visit miami also.          \nYes it is that bad!!The rain over there is totally different to what we get here-it's like a tropical storm (I've experienced it and it aint nice so pack plenty of extra waterproofs!!).It's peak hurricane season that time of year.Not to mention the heat,humidity and on top of that the crowds.If you have younger kids then I wouldn't fancy trying to keep them calm and amused while standing in line for hours with thousands of other peoples screaming kids. I was lucky that our kid was 13 so able to understand the weather and waits.I've found the best time to go is April,but if that's the only time you can go then you have no choice. You have been warned!!!          \nI've never been to Scotland so I'm not quite sure what kinds of temperatures you get in August there but I can tell you that I moved from Canada to Orlando at the end of August and it was triple digits before the humidity.  Yes, it rained a lot at that time of the year (ie. at least once a day from when I moved to December) but it was the heat when I first moved there that just about killed me.  I was sick for a couple of days while my body adjusted.  However, if you are used to extreme heat at that time of the year, you may fair better than I did.  Drink lots of water and have a hat - hopefully that will be all you need.          \nIve been there in August and it usually rains in the afternoon but it's only for a couple of hours. Everyone always say the crowds are awful but we didnt have that much of a problem. Use the fast pass system it is really good and if you do have to queue the area is usually covered and protected from the sun. Make sure you have loads of water, sunscreen and a hat. Getting to the parks early in the morning means that you will be at the front of the line. Depending on the age of your kids also look at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Renting a villa is always a plus because you have your own pool but you would need a car.

They will have loads of information to offer, including relevant insurance companies. \r\nGood luck.          \nBest bet is to contact an insurance broker. In addition to public liability you are more than likely going to need employers liability cover. Employers liability is a compulsory insurance and is required even if you are employing temporary of casual staff. \r\n \r\nThe premium is normally based on your estimated turnover and wage roll and insurers will need to know what the work entails and if there is any hazardous work. The premium will also depend on the public liability indemnity limit.

Hell will eventually be thrown into the lake of fire \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:10 \r\nAnd death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.          \nNO. HELL is where ONE WAITS for JUDGEMENT then once JUDGED sent to BURN or ACCEPTED into the KINGDOM of HEAVEN after JESUS' second COMING... \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:13-15 (New International Version) \r\n13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 15 If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. \r\n \r\nRevelation 21:4-8 (New International Version) \r\n4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\"  \r\n \r\n5 He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\"  \r\n \r\n6 He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\"          \nBecause they aren't the same. Revelation 20:14 in the King James Version reads: And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.          \nIn the dead sea scrolls, there are 10 layeers of hell described. Tartarus, sheol, hell,hades, the pit, the lake of fire.  I find it interesting that science man claims that the core of the earth is a liquid, molten inferno (lake of fire)          \nthey arent.....hades and sheol and hell mean the graves \r\n \r\nLAKE OF FIRE IS INSIDE THE EARTH which is for the devil and some do call it hellfire..          \nIt's a mythical place borrowed from ancient pagan stories so it doesn't matter what the superstitious call it. It doesn't exist. \r\n \r\n@Godboy \r\nNo big surprise there. The ancients were aware of volcanoes. Extrapolating a kingdom of fire under the earth came naturally after that. Scientific observation revealed what was really there and it wasn't supernatural.          \nThere are several things that should be understood. First, those scriptures that mention Hell, usually have the words Sheol (Hebrew) and Hades (Greek) as the original word that is translated Hell. Many translations do not use the word Hell in these instances because is does not convey the actual meaning of these words. \r\n \r\nTo start off with, the notion of a place of torment, that being Hell is false. The bible clearly teaches that a person is a soul, and the soul dies with the body. Gen 2:7 Ez 18:4, Eccl 9:4-10 \r\n \r\nWhat also shows that when a person dies they are not tormented for their sins is Rom 6:7,23. Ask yourself, if you die and are acquitted or freed of your sins, why would you then be tormented for your sins? Also, if sins bring about torment, why would the scripture say the wages of sin is death and not torment? Wouldn't torment have a greater impact on the reader? Why did God tell Adam that he would die if he ate the fruit and not be tormented? Gen 2:17 Wasn't Adam's sin the worst of all? \r\n \r\nIf Sheol & Hades were what is called Hell, a place of torment, then these faithful persons from the bible were sent to Hell: Joseph, Job, Hezekiah and Jesus. Would God torment these ones? NO! So what is translated Hell is actually just the common grave of mankind. It's a state of nothingness. \r\n \r\nWith the first death, Sheol & Hades, there is the promise of resurrection, of both righteous and unrighteous who have fallen asleep in death Acts 24:15. \r\n \r\nNow Gehenna and the Lake of Fire are the same place. This is the second death. This is an eternal death, one in which there is no hope for resurrection. Fire is often used to describe this eternal judgment. Fire represented complete destruction, not torment. The fact that it is eternal means this death is permanent. God is a God of perfect balance. Eternal life or eternal death, not eternal life or eternal torment. \r\n \r\nSo what is really confusing the issue is that there is a mistranslation of Sheol & Hades. As well as the incorrect teaching of a fiery tormenting Hell. It simply does not exist.          \nBecause hell is lack of life in a body. Or death. \r\nLake of Fire is  whatever is destroyed is thrown in there. Once something is burned... it is gone. \r\ngehenna was a garbage dump outside of Jerusalem that was kept burning, in it were thrown trash, \r\ndisease ridden dead animals and the bodies of criminals that didn't deserve a proper burial in the earth. \r\n \r\nSo is this worse than the hell some mention? not inside the earth but on Earth?          \nThe Lake of Fire means everlasting destruction. Nothing comes back from the lake of fire. Death will be thrown into the lake of fire, this will take place after Armageddon. No more death or sickness.          \nThey are not the same thing. After the great white throne judgement takes place, hades, Satan and his daemons and everybody who did not accept Christ, will be thrown there, to suffer for all eternity. Hell is a temporal place where the dead stay. Those who have not repented of their sins nor accepted christ.          ", "question": "\n    If they are the same thing ?

However, I even know who the guy likes, and she likes him back! But, I also know that one day I'll get over him... Anyway, I think that you should folllow your heart, but don't feel bad about yourself. If he doesn't like you, HE is the one missing it, not you. Personally, I think you should tell him, but tell him like if he was your friend, and just tell him you just wanna get to know him. If he is the nice guy you think he is, he will accept you and, who knows, once you get to know each other, you might start dating! I hope my advice helped....God bless you!          \nhe likes you, he is just awkward in expressing it.          \nPlease do not feel bad about yourself.  Don't you know that what you are going through is unreciprocated love?  Sometimes young people are just not ready for a heavy relationship.  He probably is enjoying his friendship with you and could be alarmed by your feelings.  You need to realize that you cannot control his feelings by being so giving and nice.  Pleasing people is the sunny side of control.  Just sit back and let him come to you.  You will be most attractive if you seem to have a vibrant and busy schedule of your own.  I would reserve my self respect  and take a wait and see approach instead of unloading your heavy feelings.  You think you feel bad now, think how you will feel by showing how needy you are. Your time will come, believe it.  Just never push your expectations on a guy and expect anything positive in return.  I have experienced where you are and so have all my friends.  But strangely enough, in the flash of one day, we all met \"the one\" and our lives were changed forever.  This will happen to you.  Just make your life exciting in other ways.  Be a friend to many people just like he does.  You WILL BE FINE.  Now, quit beating yourself up for nothing! Go live the life you deserve! Stop the the e-mails to see if you peak his curiosity.  You will notice that you will immediately feel better, because you retained the right to make a choice were HE is concerned. Trust me on this!  Preserve your power for yourself.  OK?          \nwell if you scared you he might say something you don't want to here. Just enjoy the days as they go with him. Not unless you want to talk to him and tell him how you feel about him.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120429200906AAtzqZH", "answer": "\nIf you really like to drive, these are doable. Large rental companies (Hertz, Avis, National) will let you rent in one city and return in another, although there's usually a drop fee. Compare prices, fees vary a lot. I presume you know that much of route 66 is gone, although you can still follow the route on other roads. \r\n \r\nI'd also suggest doing a little research on what you might want to see on the way. For example, in trip 2, Ithaca NY is much nicer than Binghamton, and depending on what you like, you might prefer a B&B in the nearby vineyards to either. Other than the rock and roll hall of fame, Cleveland is skippable, If you have any interest in US history, visit Williamsburg VA on the way to Richmond, perhaps taking an extra day. If you go during the summer, the outer banks of N.C. are worth a detour (partly by ferry) with a visit to Kitty Hawk, site of the first airplane flight.          \nComments on trip one: \r\n \r\n1)If possible it's also very worthwhile to drive up the CA coast from LA to San Francisco--the stretch of coast along Big Sur is arguably the most spectacular in the US, and Santa Barbara, Monterey, Heast Castle and Santa Cruz are worthwhile stops. You could add this to your trip by flying into LA, then driving to SF and carrying on from there. \r\n2) In addition to the places you list you might also check out Sequoia and King's Canyon National Parks (they're south of Yosemite) and San Diego (2-3 hours south of LA.) San Diego is also right next to Tijuana, though I'm not sure how safe it is these days. \r\n3) While Chicago is a fantastic city and well worth visiting, I'm not sure that I'd recommend Route 66. The road itself has largely been replaced by the interstate highway system (I believe that parts of it can still be used and other parts can't) and regardless, a lot of that route goes through some less than totally fascinating parts of the country. I'm not saying it's not worth doing, but there are probably more interesting places to spend your time and money (and driving a few thousand miles will suck up plenty of both.) \r\n \r\nThoughts on route 2: \r\n \r\n1) You might shoot to go through Savannah GA, or Charleston SC when heading to DC. I'm not sure there's much to see in Jacksonville, Florence or Richmond (though I haven't explored them extensively.) \r\n2) You might want to look into flying or taking a train into DC and New York. This is the most densely populated part of the US and driving in NYC especially is an unholy nightmare. \r\n3) There's not that much to see in Ohio. \r\n4) If you're shooting to see Mt Rushmore or the Crazy Horse monuments you might find it easier to fly. Also if you're going through all the trouble to get that far west, you might also check out the Devil's Tower (off 90 just inside Wyoming) or even go all the way to Yellowstone National Park.          \nTrip one, you could still stop in South Dakota by adding a couple of hours to the drive from Chicago to LA. \r\n \r\nTrip two... as a Binghamton resident, I agree and disagree with John. Ithaca is beautiful, however, Binghamton has some great attractions as well. If you are using it as a rest stop between NY City and Buffalo, is a perfect place to stop. You should also try our local favorite, the Spiedie.  \r\n \r\nAlso, Australia = 2,941,299\u00a0sq\u00a0mi and USA = 3,794,101\u00a0sq\u00a0mi...

Harsh I know.          \nWhen we know God, the Bible reads completely different than when we don't.          \nNo, a loving God wouldn't do that.          \nIn a word: NO.          \nIt is true! \r\n \r\nA place where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.  \r\n \r\nAnd for those of you that know this gospel well, yet deny the free gift of forgiveness, is reserved the gloom of utter darkness.  \r\n \r\nRepentance toward the Father, and faith in Christ Jesus. \r\n \r\nHe died for our sins, according to the scriptures. \r\nHe was buried. \r\nHe rose again on the third day, according to the scriptures. \r\n~The Gospel~ Font and center, full and complete.          \nYES  YES \r\n \r\n \r\n which is the second death.\u201d  \r\n \r\nMatthew 10:28  \r\nAnd do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  \r\n \r\nRomans 6:23   \r\nFor the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:14 \r\nThen Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.  \r\n \r\nMatthew 25:46  \r\nAnd these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d  \r\n \r\nWhat is hell like?The most common description of hell is that of fire.1 Here is a list of some of these descriptions: \r\n \r\nBible's Description of Hell fire and brimstone burning wind fiery oven  \r\nflames of fire judgment by fire unquenchable fire  \r\nfurnace of fire eternal fire eternal punishment  \r\nfiery hell pits of darkness lake of fire  \r\n \r\nPunishment and restraintSince there could possibly be a lot of party people in hell, one might think that it will be one big party. However, the problem is that the likes of Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and other unsavory characters will be there also. In order to keep those people from tormenting their neighbors excessively, all the inhabitants will be restrained through punishment (with the amount increasing with the degree of restraint required). This list below tells of some of the things that the inhabitants of hell will be going through: \r\n \r\nPunishment in Hell smoke of their torment2 no rest day and night2  \r\nweeping and gnashing of teeth3 tormented4  \r\ndeath5 their worm does not die6  \r\ndestruction7   \r\n \r\nWhy does there need to be a hell?This is a good question, since many would say that God could just destroy the evil people, rather than condemn them to a place of torment. The problem is that God made spiritual beings (humans and angels) as eternal creatures. In fact, the Bible says that God has put the knowledge of the eternal nature of our spirits within each of us: \r\n \r\nHe has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. (Ecclesiastes 3:11)          \nPeople have to recognize that the Bible uses spatial metaphors in order to describe Hell. Yes it uses the image of fire, but it also uses the image of Darkness(Matthew 22).  \r\n \r\nThese images are uses, not to pinpoint a specific place located under the earth where God throws people and has them tortured in an eternal Auschwitz. Rather, the point to the state of being of someone who rejects God's love.  \r\n \r\nDostoevsky in the Brother's Karamazov uses the best image when he says \"I maintain that Hell is the inability to love\". This means that you cut yourself off from God's unconditional love. And in doing so, as the Great Eastern mystic St Isaac the Syrian put it, our conscience then acts like the flame that burns our hearts with bitter regret. Like the bitter regret experienced by someone when they sever their relationship with their spouse          \nThere is the lake of fire in Revelation.  There's also the \"eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels\" in Matthew 25:41.  There is a debate about whether the fire is to be understood as physical or spiritual, and whether it's the same thing in both passages.  You might want to read about Darwaza, Turkmenistan before you write off the Revelation passages as purely symbolic, though.          \nAs with many biblical questions it depends on your interpretation. Some scholars will say yes and other scholars will say no. \r\nI personally don't believe that there is such a thing as hell, but that's just me.          \nThe bible is purely fiction. none of the content is true.

There will be no \"eternal torment\" in hell. That is slander against God's loving and holy name. Many people today falsely believe when the wicked people die they go straight to hell. That is NOT true. 2 Peter 2:9. \"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.\" This means there no soul in hell right now. God says he will hold back the wicked until Judgment day. \r\n \r\n\"The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.\" John 5:28, 29. \"The wicked is reserved to the day of destruction.\" \"Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.\" Job 21:30, 32. God is very specific Both the wicked and the righteous who have died are in their graves \"sleeping\" until the day of  resurrection.  \r\n \r\nThe wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Romans 6:23. \"Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\" James 1:15. \"God ... gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" John 3:16. The wages of sin or punishment is death no eternal life in hell. The wicked receive \"death.\" The righteous receive \"everlasting life.\" \r\n \r\nBut the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\" Revelation 21:8. God says the wicked will die the second death in the hellfire. The wicked will not be tormented in hell forever, if this was the case then they would be \"immortal\" That's impossible, because the Bible says God \"only hath immortality.\" 1 Timothy 6:16. When Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, an angel was posted to guard the tree of life so that sinners would not eat of the tree and \"live for ever.\" Genesis 3:22-24. The false teaching that came from satan that the wicked will be immortal in hell is not true. God prevented this when sin entered this earth when he placed an angel to guard the tree of life. \r\n \r\nThe Bible says the wicked suffer \"death\" (Romans 6:23), will suffer \"destruction\" (Job 21:30), \"shall perish\" (Psalms 37:20), will \"burn\" up (Malachi 4:1), \"shall be destroyed together\" (Psalms 37:38), will \"consume away\" (Psalms 37:20), \"shall be cut off\" (Psalms 37:9), \"shall be slain\" (Psalms 62:3). God will \"destroy\" them (Psalms 145:20), and \"fire shall devour them\" (Psalms 21:9).  Notice how all these verses make it clear that the wicked will die and be destroyed, not suffer in hell for all eternally. \r\n \r\nSo shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man ... shall cast them into a furnace of fire.\" Matthew 13:40-42. \"They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.\" Revelation 20:9. \"The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.\" Proverbs 11:31. God himself will send the fire down upon the wicked who try to takeover the holy city that God sends down. \r\n \r\n\"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.\" 2 Peter 3:10. So basically the hellfire will be as big as the earth and the fire will be extremely hot that it'll melt earth and burn \"the works that are therein.\"  Heaven will \"pass away with a great noise.\" \r\n \r\nAnd, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12. \"And then he shall reward every man according to his works.\" Matthew 16:27. \"That servant, which knew his lord's will, and ... neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.\" Luke 12:47, 48. God says according to the deeds of the wicked some will receive more punishment than others. That means satan will receive the worst punishment of all. \r\n \r\nBehold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.\" Isaiah 47:14. \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.\" \"And God shall wip  ", "title": "\n    Do you believe the wicked will be eternally tormented in hell?

They weren't miserable it was their custom out of respect for their loved one.  They would however hire people to cry, mourn and wale at the person's funeral but some funerals were celebrated with jazz bands and such so I don't get what you're saying about liking the dark clothes and being miserable since it sounds like it has nothing to do with the mourning.  See people mourn a loss of any kind not just death but they are not mourning as you describe it because of the person or pet that passes, they are mourning for themself because they don't know how to go on when this person or pet goes away.  The internet has a list of 10 steps to mourning that if a person has a problem they should go to.  Even psychologists send them to this list.  There is no reason at all to cut or want to die, that's not even reasonable and certainly isn't mature either or even using common sense.  Certainly to shed a few tears and do what's necessary to get the person or pet who passed into the ground is what's necessary but from that time on it's all custom and tradition if you wish to visit a cemetery or remember them with a prayer.          \nWhy would you want to become part of a stereotype?

Just a 4 hour queue and a huge disappointment for me.  \r\n \r\nStealth is worth getting fast pass which has samurai inclusive in it. Both are great, probably Samurai is better as Stealth ends in 14.2 seconds flat lol :)          \nStealth is alright but Colossus is waay the best ride there!          \nYep STEALTH is definatly the best ride there. The others are good but no way near as good as Stealth! The only downside is it's too short. \r\n \r\nAvPenguin: Stealth does NOT move that quickly, I was in it for atleast 45 minutes when I first qued up, maybe even an hour. You just got lucky the times you went. :p \r\n \r\nSaw ques are just ridiculus for a ride so bad, it doesn't matter if the back is better than the front, it's terrible for being that bad at the front in the first place and being that badly made. Uncomfortable and quite boring for me. Was a waste of 2 hours! Though a lot of people like it for some reason. \r\n \r\nI don't really hear that much great things about Rush, probably because it's always down and is way too short to really enjoy. It's good but not as good as Vortex I think, you get more of a rush on that than Rush. :p \r\n \r\nStealth, Vortex, Nemesis Inferno I'd say are the best ones there. Slammer is good but more scary than enjoyable, lol.          \nstealth and saaaw becuase they are the most daring and most fastest rides there but u will have to get the fast track or your skrewed oh yea if it is hot tidal wave is the 1 for u \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n                HAV FUN GO ON STEALTH IF IT IS NOT CLOSED \r\n                               GET FAST TRACK          \nI have never been to Thorpe Park.

You may want to check with your homeowners insurance company.  They may provide the liability, for free.          \nIf you placed your vehicle or residential insurance through an insurance broker, then go back to that same broker and tell them you need an \"Event Liability\" policy (direct writers do not do this type of policy, so if you went through a direct writer haul out the Yellow Pages). This policy will cover an event with or without liquor liability. This type of policy can last from one day to several days. The premium for this type of varies as it is affected by such things as: the type of event (i.e. wedding, sporting event, charity concert, trade show, etc); the number of people attending; whether event is open to the public; if anything is being sold at the event; whether liquor liability is required. I have sold this type of policy for $150 (including liquor liability) for a small, private party (less than 100 people) and I have sold this type of policy for $1,100 (four day performance art festival which was open to the public where alcohol was sold), so as you can see the price can vary. Be aware that unless this is a small party (i.e. less than 30 people) and no alcohol is being provided no personal lines insurer would extend liability to cover this type of event. This is too large a risk for a personal lines insurer.          \nif you are in australia - you may have an extension of cover under your HOME CONTENTS policy for accidents that occur while you are away from the insured property.  This may respond, unless they want you to get special event hire cover. \r\n \r\nThat seems like a really weird request to me.

Very good ride! Everyone chickens out of it because you only have a bar on your waist to keep you in.

And well the true victory is eternal torment. If he let them die, then they would miss out on the torment and not suffer. He will make them suffer and that is the true victory. By the way Islam is the truth. You might want to look it up if you are confused with Christianity.          \nSatan and his demons are not in hell yet.  They currently have freedom to roam, but are limited in what they can do. Eventually after Satan's plans come to a head, he will be chained up and his pals tossed into the lake of fire when Christ returns to earth. It is all in the book of Revelation. \r\n \r\nWhat they can and can't do in the lake of fire is anyone guess, but it suppose to be torment forever. The Lake of Fire is called the second death for some reason.          \nSome interpretations of the bible lead people to think that Hell is the state of annihilation and not a literal place. Try veganism, it's holy.          \nSatan and his demons are on earth. It is my understanding tht in the end they will be cast into hell and torchered for eternity with the nonbelievers. God has victory over evil because god rules over hell.          \nGood thing that eternal torment is a false doctrine. \r\n \r\nTruth about Hell \r\n  \r\nThe Bible teaches the TOTAL DESTRUCTION of the lost. This includes body and soul. (Matthew 7:13, Phillipians 3:18, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, Matthew 10:28, Psalm 5:6, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 21:9-10, Psalm 28:4-5, Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 92:7, Psalm 145:20, Proverbs 10:29-30, Isaiah 1:28, Isaiah 26:14, Luke 17:26-30, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, Luke 17:28-30, Joel 1:15,) \r\n  \r\nThe wages of sin is DEATH (Romans 6:23, Genesis 2:16-17, Ezekial 18:4, Isaiah 26:14, James 1:15, Ezekial 33:11) \r\n  \r\nThe wicked will be DEVOURED, BURNED UP, and CONSUMED (Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 104:35, Isaiah 1:28, Psalm 21:8-10, Psalm 50:3, Ezekial 22:31, Revelation 20:9, Isaiah 1:28, Psalm 104:35) \r\n  \r\nThose who reject Jesus will PERISH (John 3:16, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 10:16, Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 97:3, Psalm 68:2, Luke 13:5, II Peter 3:9, Psalm 68:1-2, Psalm 37:20, Isaiah 41:11, I Corinthians 1:8) \r\n  \r\nThe lost will be SLAIN CARCASES (Psalm 139:19, Isaiah 11:4, Isaiah 66:15-16, 24) \r\n  \r\nThe wicked will be NO MORE, COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN, THEY WILL BE AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED. This cannot be true if they will be tortured forever in Hell because they would still exist and would not be forgotten. (Obadiah 1:15-16, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 37:10, 20, 38. Psalm 104:35, Isaiah 26:14, Psalm 140:10, Isaiah 41:11-12, Psalm 37:9-10, Proverbs 2:22, Proverbs 10:25) \r\n  \r\nThe fire shall not be quenched does not mean the fire will never go out but rather that it will keep burning until it is finished consuming its fuel. Carefully read these. (Jeremiah 17:27, Jude 7). Are either of these burning right now and will continue to burn for eternity or did the fire totally consume them and leave them as ashes?  \r\n  \r\nThe unrepentant will be ASHES. (Malachi 4:1-3) \r\n  \r\nThe Bible is clear that those who have the Son have life. Those who do not have the Son do not have life. What is the opposite of life? DEATH. Not eternal torture. (I John 5:12) \r\n  \r\nJesus describes it as eternal punishMENT not eternal punishING (Matthew 25:46) \r\n  \r\nThe soul is not immortal. It can die (Ezekial 18:4, Matthew 10:28). \r\n  \r\nFor more info exposing the false doctrine of Eternal Torment: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n          \nThe afterlife domain cannot be compared to this existing phase. \r\nOver here we 'live and exists'. Over there we either live or exists. \r\nShould we exist without living then the 'time factor' would be phased out and the torment that we would endure would consists of the 'acts' that we had performed that had been meant to instill pain and harm. \r\nThis 'pain and harm' would not be altered or changed which would hurt us eternally in the same manner as it had been meant to hurt others. \r\nWithin this static domain only internal combustion would be made, and God's victory would be claimed since He has done all He could to save us all.          \nthe english confuses many about this subject \n \nthe PUNISHMENT (is ETERNAL) \nnot the torment \n \nsouls shall perish \nit is called the 2cd death for good reason \n \n \nsee Rev 20  \n \n \n \nHbr 12:29 For our God [is] a consuming fire.  \n \n \n \nsatan is going to become ashes (is this eternal torture)? \n \nhell shall not exist forever....(is this ETERNAL)? \n \nthe verses for help \n \n \n \n Rev 20:7 \u00b6 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,   \n \n \n Rev 20:8   And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.   \n \n \n Rev 20:9   And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.   \n \n \n - this is the 2cd death......(for these) \n        this is not eternal torture.... \n \nverse 20 is the verse that confuses things.... \n \n \nbelow shows satan (he is this king of Tyre) \nis this eternal torture..... \n \nEze 28:16   By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.   \n \n \n Eze 28:17   Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.   \n \n \n Eze 28:18   Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee,  \n==> and I will bring thee to ashes <==  upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.   \n \n \n Eze 28:19   All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee:  \nthou shalt be a terror, => and never [shalt] thou [be] any more.  <= \n \nthe smoke of this goes up forever and ever (this is the point of Rev 20) \n \nHELL or DEATH shall not exist once the ETERNITY begins \neveryone who overcomes shall have an immortal soul.... \n \n \nStrong's Greek Lexicon Search Results \n \n---------------------------------------... \n \n \nResult of search for \"deathlessness\": \n110. athanasia ath-an-as-ee'-ah from a compound of 1 (as a negative particle) and 2288; deathlessness:--immortality.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhere is the word blot (just to make sure you understand this) \n \n \nExd 32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, \n Whosoever hath sinned against me, \n==>  him will I blot out of my book.  <== \n \nLexicon Results Strong's H4229 - machah \u05de\u05b8\u05d7\u05b8\u05d4 \nTransliteration \nmachah  \n Pronunciation \n \nm\u00e4\u00b7kh\u00e4' (Key) \n \n  \nPart of Speech \nverb \n \n Root Word (Etymology) \n \nA primitive root  \n  \nTWOT Reference \n1178,1179,118  \n  \nOutline of Biblical Usage  \n1) to wipe, wipe out \n \na) (Qal) \n \n1) to wipe \n \n2) to blot out, obliterate \n \n3) to blot out, exterminate \n \nb) (Niphal) \n \n1) to be wiped out \n \n2) to be blotted out \n \n3) to be exterminated \n \nc) (Hiphil) to blot out (from memory) \n \n2) (Qal) to strike \n \n3) (Pual) full of marrow (participle) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n - i hope this helps \n \n \n<><          \nSatan, his demons and all unsaved will end up in the lake of fire and be tormented forever, day and night, never knowing any rest.

He said to me, \u201cThere are \r\nfour words that I am going to use that are throughout the Bible to \r\ndescribe Hell. The first is a Hebrew word, Sheol [sheh-ole\u2019], which \r\nis the world of the dead or the grave. This place is where the souls of \r\nthe ungodly and the godly men and women came when they died \r\ncenturies ago. The second is Greek\u2014Hades [hah\u2019-dace], which is \r\nthe place of departed souls and spirits, or where a sinner goes after \r\ndeath. However, before my crucifixion and resurrection, Hades was \r\ndivided into two sections that were separated by a large impassable \r\ngulf, which I created. The upper right side of Hades was called both \r\nAbraham\u2019s Bosom and Paradise. The Room of the Cursed is a portion \r\nof what once was Abraham\u2019s Bosom in Hades. I will allow you to see \r\nthe Room of the Cursed before your tour comes to an end in the \r\nOuter Darkness of Hell. In the cursed Paradise of the Outer Darkness \r\nof Hell, it was very pleasant. It had streams of water running through \r\nit, and green trees. It looked much like a beautiful well-maintained \r\npark. It contained the souls of all of those persons who had died and \r\nput their trust in me as God during the Old Testament period, up until \r\nthe time of the death and resurrection of your Lord and Savior Jesus \r\nChrist. All those human spirits that were in the Paradise of Hades \r\n[Hell] were very much conscious. They were not soul-sleeping. They \r\nwere quite alive. After the crucifixion, I spent three days in Hades, \r\npreaching to the spirits that were there.\u201d \r\n \r\nThe third word to describe Hell is also a Greek word, which is \r\nTartaros [Tar-tar-os\u2019]. Tartaros is this portion of Hell that I want \r\nyou to see specifically. This is the reason why I brought you here to \r\nHell: so you can be a witness to all back on Earth, testifying that \r\nthere is a place of severe punishments and judgment for those who \r\ndisobey my Holy Word, which is called the Holy Bible. This place is \r\ncalled the Outer Darkness of Hell. Tartaros has many jail cells. I \r\nspoke of Tartaros in my Holy Word. This portion of Hell contains the \r\nangels who sexually sinned with the women of the Earth before \r\nNoah\u2019s flood. I only mentioned Tartaros one time throughout the \r\nentire Bible: in the book of 2nd Peter, the second chapter, verse four.\u201d \r\n\u201cFor if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down \r\nto Hell [Tataros], and delivered them into chains of darkness, \r\nto be reserved unto judgment;\u201d - 2 Peter 2:4 KJV \r\n\u201cThese are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a \r\ntempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.\u201d \r\n2 Peter 2:17 KJV \r\n \r\n \r\nWhile Out of My Body, I Saw God, Hell and the Living Dead \r\n \r\nJesus is the only way.          \nSatan and his army can't mess with Jehovah God because it already proves in the Bible [ Read whole Matthew Chapter 4] \nDon't worry Satan and his punks won't last long.

However every self employed contract I have been offered over the years has demanded one. No liability insurance then no contract.          \nIt probably is.  Most states require licensed contractors to carry both liability and workman's compensation insurance.  Lapse of insurance is cause for suspension of your license.  (You should know this if you are a licensed contractor.) \r\n \r\nIf you are signing a contract, and you agree to that clause, then you have legally agreed to carry the insurance.

However if anyone works for you directly, or indirectly in so far as you are legally responsible for them - then it is a legal requirement to have Employers Liability for them (and you won't get that without having PL for both you and your employee/s).

But court and solicitor's fee would eventually be worth much more than the phone itself. you have to ask yourself if it is financially worth the hassle. Good luck.          \nThe court costs would be more than the phone.  While you can also sue for the costs to be covered by him, you would have to win the case AND it's up to you to get the money.  Just because the court rules in your favor, they will not force him to pay for either the phone or the fees.  That will be up to you.

I mean, it's OK, but you might be surprised that you're paying that much for the area. Supply and demand. Keep alert and get great locks on your apt and a car alarm and you'll be fine. Parking sucks. Beachwood Dr is the big street that goes up in to the hills with lots of apt buildings. To be in the Hollywood HIlls you'll want a place above Franklin Ave. Then west from about La Brea Ave along Hollywood and Franklin Ave there are also many apts. \r\n \r\nIf that's the kind of environment you want, you might also try Los Feliz - east from Western Ave, around Hollywood Bl, Franklin Ave, Los Feliz Bl, Silverlake, and West Hollywood. All of those places have sketchy and nice areas and a variety of apts.  \r\n \r\nIf you go to the east, there is Glendale, Eagle Rock, Altadena and Pasadena. Lots of apts and areas similar to the Hollywood Hills.  \r\n \r\nWest of West Hollywood is going to be very expensive for decent areas. \r\n \r\nThey will run a credit check on you before renting and some places are very persnickity. You can't pay months in advance to make up for bad credit. \r\n \r\nSafety Info:           \nHollywood Hills has some extremely expensive apartments, and it's rich/wealty celebrity territory.  More than $1500 a month for rent, I believe.  The problem is that the housing is located in the high hills of Los Angeles (hence the name of the area) and so the mansions and nice apartments there are prone to strong brushfires.  A lot of celebrities suffer, but you know their lives can't always be easy. \r\n \r\nIf you can find anything affordable, go for it, because Hollywood Hills is a safe area.  However, please note California has a 12%+ unemployment rate, higher than the national average of 9.1%.  And although it may seem that Los Angeles is a rich city, it is not.  Much of the area is impoverished is constantly being raided by illegal immigrants trying to look for a job in a financially-troubled state.  Right now the 3 richest counties in the United States are Loudoun County, Virginia; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Howard County, Maryland, all located in the Washington, D.C. area, which has a below-average unemployment rate, only 6%.  Tax rate in California is 8%, as opposed to the nation's capital area, with only 5%. \r\n \r\nEach year, California also has to experience natural disasters.  Mudslides during late-winter and spring, earthquakes all-year around, and wildfires all-year around, and flash floods during the summer.

And you will be unable to find a job here without an engineering degree at this time. \r\n \r\nPlus, the Hollywood Hills is one of the more expensive areas to live. \r\n \r\nAs well, you cannot rent in California without passing a US credt check.          \nI hope this is for a holiday and not permanent you're asking.

Can you imagine trying to support a child when you're in middle school? Or getting an incurable std that you have to deal with for the rest of your life? Wait, it'll be that much better when you do.          \nI would say bad because your first time is supposed to be special. You will always want to remember it . Do you really think it will be special at thirteen? Imagine yourself twenty years from now. Will you end up regretting it? Also, the younger you do it the longer more you have to worry about STDs or getting anyone pregnant. If you do decide to do it please use protection.          \nMy son ! Really 13? You beat me, My first time was 14. \r\n \r\nOther than that its up to you honestly ignore what people say.  \r\nThey say its a bad idea to me I dont care. \r\nIts just you and your mate's hormones  \r\nGo for it little man !          \nIf she gave you that, you already had some kind of sexual relations, and it's still considered sex. And no. Your 13 years old and your nowhere near getting married, absolutely not. You two doing this now shows irresponsibility. Are you going to take care of a baby if she gets pregnant, or are you going to have her get an abortion, or run like most men do? If you know your not ready, I suggest you do not engage any further then what you and this girl already have done. Sex is not a new game you play or a joke. It's serious business. And if your not prepared, somebody is bound to get hurt for real. You need to save sex for marriage and take your time getting to know this girl, if she is your girlfriend. And at this point, a boy your age should not be having a girlfriend this young, and needs to focus on getting to a good high school and apply to the college of your choice. When your ready to marry and be serious with a girl, is the time you date. You want to marry at 18, then date at 16 the most. In your 20's, 16 to whenever your ready. \r\n \r\nDon't date to fool around like your doing now. That's how you two will end up in heartbreak and the relationship is bound to fail. \r\n \r\nBest Regards          \nare you ready to have kids?          \nif your not ready to be a daddy you should wait  \r\nthink what it would be like if she got pregnant and what would happen with her and your family          \nI lost it at 14 and it felt amazing,so yeah go ahead,just use a condom and dont forget foreplay! \r\nand this may help: \r\n          \nawful idea, wait for marriage          \nThis is a subject brought up very often here. Because of society and the standards of today 13 is still considered a child. Most if not all are still in school.  Today 13 is considered too young to be having intercourse. In most states it is below the age of consent. \r\n \r\nAbout 100 to 150 years ago and for thousands of years before (different society and different standards) many girls were married by age 13 and most were pregnant or had children by age 14. Indeed the mother of Jesus the Christ, Mary, was between 12 and  13 when she was made pregnant by the Lord God and between 13 and 14 when she delivered. \r\n \r\nHaving sex at 13 may not be the best idea but that does not mean you should totally refrain either. Just be prepared for the out come. At 13 you are very fertile and can get pregnant easily. Be absolutely sure you are on a good birth control. Always practice safe sex to lower the chances of STDs. DON'T have intercourse until you are ready and consensual to having sex. Don't let some boy talk you into having sex. Many young guys just want to score with as many girls as they can and could care less about the feelings of her. \r\n \r\nAbstinence is not the best route either. It has been proven over and over the so called \"Abstinence pledges\" cause more problems than not. In many cases waiting until marriage to have sex can cause more divorces mainly due to adultery or cheating. Also STDs are higher among those who are abstinent . \r\n \r\nSo what is the right age to have sex and intercourse? This has to be decided by you, your knowledge of the matter, and that you are not being forced into it. Are you ready for it or are you just curious. Weigh all the factors I have given here and anymore you can think of. Learn all you can first and don't be sorry later.          \nA wise man once said and I quote  \r\n\"Don't have sex. Cause you will get pregnant, and die.\" \r\nDon't do that to her man. Don't be a killer.          \nbad idea plenty of time for risk of disease and babies later          \nFrom the viewpoint of a 13 year old, ANY form of sexual relief is wonderful. HOWEVER, the truth is that at 13 YOUR body is not finished growing and developing into an adult and won't be for at least 5 or more years.  The only CONSTANT thing in the life of a teenager is CHANGE.  From music, food, clothes, friends and a million other things, you will be undergoing CHANGE each and every day. Your very body itself is constantly changing during puberty to adolescence. So, good or bad idea? One of the absolute worst things you could do at this age.  \r\n \r\nFrankly, at 13 you could not possibly know all the facts required for you and your girlfriend at this time before she changes like everything else in your life. \r\n \r\nThe very best advice I can give you is for the two of you to pet, fondle, kiss, cuddle and/or massage each other to the point of masturbating one another.  In other words accept the fact that 95% of teens, male and female, masturbate.  The other 5% are liars!  So, accept the fact that masturbation is natural and necessary in order to relieve yourself and learn what turns you on vs. what does not.  \r\n \r\nSpend some time along, with a nice body old and massage each other naked.  Use your hands, tongue, fingers and mouth to cause the other to masturbate.  If it involves her giving you a slow, steady, quality blow  job while you lick and finger her vagina (Also known as a 69er\" then go for it.  \r\nIf it means actually having penetration by you into her vagina with your penis the answer is NO! \r\n \r\nThe other answers are good but lack the down to earth reasons.  You are far to old to become parents.  Your bodies are still growing, let them develop.Keep your sexual activity to a decided set of reliefs. To get good head, have her run  her tongue around the head of your penis. Then have her hold  the base of your penis with one hand and with the opposite hand have her massage your balls. \r\nThis will get you squirming and tossing and ultimate you will ejaculate.  Make sure she goes deeper and deeper with each stroke, taking more penis into her mouth with each stroke. Ask her to accept all your ejaculate into her mouth and to spit or swallow it when she has finisheed.  Then back to the massage to get every drop out of his body.  AVOID \"Babies having babies. \r\n \r\nWait until you are at least 18 and able to really pleasure a woman (not a little girl). When you wait to 18 each minimum you will better understand that actual intercourse requires skill and patience. \r\nBetween now and then, practice masturbating to the point of ALMOST and then STOP. Let things settle and start again but when you get to ALMOST again, STOP again and let things settle. \r\nAfter 3 or 4 sessions like this, keep stroking until you ejaculate every drop. THIS prepares you for intercourse when you will gently slide your penis into her vagina a little at a time until it is all the way into her at which point you will \"pop her cherry\" which simply means your penis will penetrate through her hymen barrier causing her to bleed and to experience pain. \r\n \r\nI hope you find this not only interesting and informative but your best answer. Last and most important, NEVER have sexual relations with a female unless you are wearing a good quality condom.  No Exceptions  Ever!  Believe me, getting your rocks off manually until you are 18 is not so bad overall.  Get a girl pregnant and see how that changes your life (and sex life!). \r\n \r\nAll the best young stud.  Jerk off, get head, do whatever you need to do to get relief up to at least 18 whereby you can still say you are both virgins and intend to remain so until you at least 18 to 20. Let that kind of comment get back to her parents and you will never have parental objections. \r\n \r\nGood luck and good lovin'.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101212050943AAAZEqs", "answer": "\ndo as much stuff as possible yourself!!! shop around, dont buy the first stuff you see.          \nwe did ours for less than 3000.  \r\ntry to keep guest numbers down. \r\nshop around for a venue. doesnt have to be all posh n fancy to be nice. our evening do was just at a nice country pub.  \r\nwe had a family member who has a really good camera to do the photos. \r\nwe didnt have flowers cos we both hate them. but fake flowers are much cheaper and you can keep them. \r\nfamily member made the cake. \r\nborrowed the wedding cars off someone the brides dad knew. \r\nbride made her own dress. (or search net vigarouly for bargins). \r\navoid wedding shops for decorations cos they are stoopidly expensive. a lot of normal high street shops or the internet are just as good. \r\nwe made the invitations ourselves. it is very simple to make your own on standard computer software and get them printed by a local printing shop if not by yourself.          \nElope.          \nDear one \r\n \r\nCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials. \r\n \r\nBudgets are hard to deal with, no fun at all. Here are some tips, however. \r\n \r\nFool yourself. Mentally set a 3,000 pound budget and keep the remaining 2,000 in the bank for overages (there will always be overages). \r\n \r\nWith due respect to the Royals, ignore all the hype and such the media will stir into the mix. Turn off those silly \"reality\" shows about this wedding or that bridezilla. Truly, you are not going to allow yourself to become a bridezilla and the Loch Ness Monster is more real than those \"reality\" shows are. That means you don't need to release live trout into the wild, reforest Spain, or some other silly \"need.\" You don't need all that stuff. \r\n \r\nWith that in mind, learn the art of compromise. Pick your battles carefully. That means if your future MIL desperately wants you to wear the veil that she wore in her wedding - how about it? It could be the \"something borrowed\" or \"something old\" part - and will go miles and miles towards earning good points as a woman deserving of her son.  Same thing for all kinds of \"details\" in your wedding. Let others make decisions (within your budget of course - and let it be known that you have a very limited amount of money to spend). But if your sister or grandmother desperately want blue cornflowers on the tables - hey, that's fine as long as they're not blowing your money away. \r\n \r\nOne poster suggested that you do a lot of work yourself. Baloney. You will be too busy being the bride to fold won-tons or cut out cookies - but that could be a great way to invite your various and future family members into your life - hold a stuffed cabbage party - with everyone making stuffed cabbage leaves for the wedding buffet. \r\n \r\nNow there's a limit to accepting favors. If a family/friend wants to bake your cake - but has no experience with wedding cakes - or baking at all unless from a mix, perhaps that might be a favor passed over - but if he or she is famous for smoked salmon or some other delicacy, perhaps they would be willing to produce that instead. \r\n \r\nFinally, yes William and Kate's wedding will be attended by hundreds at the reception ball; but you just want your closest friends and family around you. Keep the guest list down to 25 or less and make it clear to those who would surprise you with additional attendees, that they will be monetarily responsible for the extra guests. That is the only rule where you have little choice but to be adamant if you want to keep within your budget. OF course, since you have made your budget public knowledge (within your families) then your family members are well aware of the limited funds under which you are operating. Therefore, Great Aunt Cecilia who lives 200 km away and who hasn't seen, spoken or corresponded with you since you were five - may just have to miss this one. \r\n \r\nGood luck honey.          \nI kept my wedding under 5,000 dollars \r\n \r\nThere are a few things I did \r\nThe dress, I paid 250 dollars for the dress \r\nIt was not the dress I would pick if I had all the money, but it was pretty, the best dress for the price I could paid \r\nflowers, I did single red with a pink ribbon for the bouquet for the bridesmaid and MOH \r\nSingle flower will be a lot less, you may do it yourself.  I had a friend that bought Calla Lillies and did three with a ribbon she tied herself.  This save a lot of money \r\nFlowers is a huge saving if you do in season flowers.  The problem with May, is Mother's Day, if your wedding is the first two weeks,  you will pay more for flowers \r\nYou do simple in season flowers,  you will save a lot \r\n \r\nCenter pieces, I used the ones that came with the venue \r\nThere were not fancy, maybe not really, I do not remember, but that is an area I saved money \r\n \r\nI had a photographer for the wedding and an hour extra.  Not having it the whole day, saved more than half \r\nThis was a way I saved money \r\n \r\nInvitation, I saved money \r\n \r\nWe had our wedding on a friday, knowing a lot of our friends and family could not make a Friday night wedding because they lived more than a few hours away and work.  I like the friday night weddings \r\nI know some areas of the US give discounts on Friday and Sunday weddings.  Not were I live, not sure if that is true in the UK.  That is something to look at.  If any day is cheaper than another day \r\n \r\nWe used an DJ, much cheaper than a Band \r\nSome people use Ipod and have people running the music \r\n \r\nThe biggest expense in most weddings are reception(venue and food) and dress \r\nIF you could do venue for under 3,000, if you are very careful with everything else you could do it for under five.  The less you could do the reception for, the better \r\n \r\nCake is another area \r\nI have know people that have someone that can bake bake the cake \r\nSome do if as a gift other for cost \r\nDo you have someone who could make a cake?  Not everyone does, if you do, that could be a huge savings \r\n \r\n \r\nI had a wonderful wedding I could afford \r\nIt was not the wedding I would of had if I had a lot of money \r\nThere is nothing wrong with cutting out things or doing the cheap          \nBest way is to keep the guest list small. We spent the most money on guests; we wanted nice food and drinks, and per person it ended up at about $100.  \r\n \r\nOther ways to save money: \r\n \r\n1. Buy flowers wholesale and do your own bouquets. \r\n2. Go with a DJ instead of a band. Or, better yet, have an iPod DJ if you can get speakers. Downside to this is that you won't have a master of ceremonies announcing everything, but you could ask a friend or relative to do it. \r\n3.On that note, enlist talented friends and relatives to perform specific tasks, and give them tips instead of payment. Know anyone who is a good photographer? Has a good taste in music? Can sew? Bake a beautiful cake?  \r\n4. If you want a more professional touch, post on Craigslist or a similar site. We found a photographer who was just starting her business, so she charged about half as much as the other pros in our area, but the quality was just as good. \r\n5. Design a budget. You can find samples online that can give you percentage estimates based on your total budget. Build in a cushion. We spent about $2k more on our wedding than we expected on our $10k wedding because we had more people RSVP yes than we expected.          \ndont get married spend the money on the house          \nwrite your own invitations, get a friend to do the photos (one who is good with a camera of course). Choose your venue carefully, don't invite too many people, just the ones you really want to have there-its your day remember.          \nFirst let me say that 5000 is a good budget to have a nice wedding.  I am planning a wedding for June 2011 and I will say that keeping the guests list helps a lot.  It is expensive to feed 200 people LOL.  But anyway, I would write a list of things that you just have to have for your wedding and then things that you can do without. Dont choose the first thing that you see, shop around for venues and it helps to find somewhere that would let you have the wedding and reception in the same place.  I agree with doing alot of things yourself helps.  Use alot of your resources that you know would help you with the wedding. Good luck!!!          \nCongrats on your wedding \r\n \r\nCall in your family and friends to help out \r\nYou could have a family meal and then invite friends to the party afterwards \r\nGet family/friends to do your flowers (grow them in advance for seasoning in May) and make your cake \r\nBuy your bridesmaid dresses in the january sales \r\nGet the lend of a friends snazzy car instead of hiring one \r\nKeep your bridal party numbers low so you don't have to pay too much for suits/dresses \r\nOxfam have a bridal department that does cheap dresses \r\nUse church candles with labels rather than personalised fancy ones \r\nBuy your invitations in the local stationary shop (they might do you a deal) \r\nSee if you can get less options for the courses of the meal and try for a package deal with your reception \r\nYou could hire a band that covers both traditional and disco music \r\nYou could buy boxes of sweets and pop them on plates with a thank you note as wedding favours          \nThe best way to keep a wedding under budget is to trim the guest list. The reception takes up the majority of your money. Consider something like a back yard reception or at a church hall. Shop around for everything such as the dress, flowers, etc. Try to find decorations in the dollar store and flowers and cake at the supermarket. Do you own invitations and thank you cards. If all else fails, consider the courthouse. You will emerge as married as anyone. Best wishes!          \ncongratulations! i'm getting married in april 2011. i have a friend making my cake, another friend helped pay for my dress because she doesn't know what to give for a present and she thought that would be thoughtful. i got my reception/food for a thousand pounds, wanted a church but settled for registry office. think of alternatives to cars. my local taxi firm will do it for \u00a390. the rag and bone man for \u00a3100. buy the bridesmaids normal dresses that they can wear again and that no one will have a fit if they get dirty. a friend is doing the photo's but you could get a professional to just do a few and then put disposable cameras on the tables at reception so guests can take snaps. these are more relaxed natural shots than a professional would take. we are older and have everything we need. we already have two toasters etc! we have made up a little poem asking guests to make an anonymous donation to help pay for our honeymoon instead.          \nDO It Yourself is the way to go to keep your budget low. I've included links to Martha Stewart, who has some awesome projects from floral arrangements to favors. And if you do DIY projects you can have a party were you, your bridesmaids, mother and mother in law can do these projects together. \r\n \r\nInvitations:  \r\nMichael's-- \r\n \r\nParty City-- \r\n \r\nJoann's-- \r\n \r\nWalmart-- \r\n__________________ \r\nMartha Stewart: \r\n \r\nCenterpieces-- \r\nBoutonnieres & corsages-- \r\nBouquets-- \r\nCeremony Decor--          \nLots of items you can save money on, bake a cake, friends and family can cook something everyone can bring some wine. \r\nAs Polly states a friend with a good camera is not enough even a student will lack the skills needed here. \r\nAn experienced wedding photographer provides much more than quality photographs, but will be good dealing with people and able to capture real emotions quickly. A professional photographer will plan every aspect of your wedding day so that you can relax and enjoy meeting family and friends. If the weather takes a turn for the worst and your event moves indoors, a great deal of skill is required to create light that is flattering and creative. \r\nYour photographs are an investment and one of the few things that last well beyond your wedding day.

You should contact A&L in the first instance, tell them what happened, and ask for the policy to be cancelled and the premiums refunded.  If you don't have any luck with them, you can pursue the case with the Financial Ombudsman.          \nNo you don't, payment protection can sometimes be worth having but it's usually way overpriced and unnecessary; it's like when they try to sell you extended warranties on electrical goods.          \nYour independent financial advisor is right. There is no need to take any form of payment protection insurance at all. In fact the Office of Fair Trading are considering banning the practice of selling insurance with loans, precisely because people are persuaded to buy something that they don't need and is probably overpriced.          \nYou have been misled. The payment protection is usually non-negotiable, because it means if you default on the loan, the bank will be able to get their money back. However, if you have proof of insurance covering that loan from anywhere else, you can argue that the loan is covered even though it is not their own insurance policy. \r\nIf you do not have any payment protection insurance at all, the bank can reasonably refuse you the loan.          \nI found a good atricle relating to this on moneysavingexpert, and tells how to claim it back, hope it helps: \r\n          ", "question": "\n    About 12 months ago I took out a bank loan loan with Aliance & Leicester.

For example, you can have a set containing matrices, rational numbers, polygons, polynomials all in one set. \r\n \r\nHowever, almost every mathematical object can be built up from sets based on the rules of axiomatic set theory.  Numbers, matrices, points, lines can all be defined as sets, or sets of sets, or sets of sets of sets, etc.  In other words when being very rigorous and precise, there is only one \"kind\" of object ... namely a sets.  So sets are only allowed to contain \"nothing\" or to contain other sets as elements. \r\n \r\nIn truth, it can get even more complicated than that and sometimes sets can get too large (the \"set\" of all sets) and mathematicians forbid such \"large\" sets from being defined as sets because they lead to paradoxes. \r\n \r\nSo from a strictly mathematical viewpoint, you won't find presidents and dishwashers in sets (although you can have different kinds of mathematical objects as these can all be built up from sets), although if you step outside of the strictly mathematical realm, it is certainly permissible to mix and match non-mathematical objects and mathematical objects within sets.          \nyes          ", "question": "\n    I am confused about the elements of a set.

You need to move to where you can afford to live.           \nYes, if you file bankruptcy, you can keep your house - in most cases. Contact an attorney or legal aide office (most attorneys have a free initial consultation). \r\n \r\nPersonally, I would let the credit cards go. Pay the house and lights/gas/telephone. The worst that will happen is that you'll get alot of harassing phone calls...which will stop when you file bankruptcy. The bankruptcy will also stop the creditors from seeking getting paid through garnishing your husband's pay or your bank account. \r\n \r\nGood luck - bankruptcy is not the end of the road. It just might be a beginning for you.           \nyes but if you are not able to be discharged in court from these bills then the cc companies can sue you and get a judgment and then attach liens that would at some point have to be paid.

I would look to downsize and use the money to pay off the credit cards. Better to live in a smaller house than lose everything.           \nChapter 7 bankruptcy allows you to keep your home while erasing your unsecured debt. However--you must meet income and debt tests now--it's not as simple as it used to be. Your assets will be counted, and that will include your home, and your income will be counted--all the jobs.  \r\n \r\nHave you tried credit counseling first? The firms who do credit counseling are really good these days, and they can help you get a plan to pay down your debts without bankruptcy. Since you're up to date on your mortgage, you should be able to do a chapter 13 which reorganizes your debts and allows you to actually pay them off--without touching your house.  \r\n \r\nTry this firm: CCCS. They're on line--you would google that name and the area where you live to find one in your area. \r\n \r\nyou don't have to drown in credit debt.

Not recommending this though.          \nGirl, its OK-puberty sucks and it is not an easy place to be. Try focusing on self esteem building skills. Find something that you are interested in and excel at that -the urge to have sex can be strong at your age d/t puberty and if you have bad feelings about yourself the urge is intensified. u are not wrong and self berating yourself only makes this harder. Talk to a councilor , or clergy or someone who you feel you can trust, you need good strong advise from a professional. Try to get involved with your peers , at church or community functions, etc.Be trust worthy because once you break your parents trust you can never fully regain it. Try sports, exercise and there is no shame in masterbation.It is an excellent stress reliever and natural at your age. Being sexually  active is NOT natural for some one of your age..Good luck always          \nMasturbate duh -.-          ", "question": "\n    I'm 13 yrs old and since my birthday I've felt horny all the time!

Please do yourself a favor, and come out here for a week or so to look around and see for yourself what the housing costs are, what the job market is like, what the different areas are like, what the general everyday expenses will be, etc. before you commit yourself to moving here.  \r\n \r\nMany people who move here sight unseen are pleased and decide to stay, but there are also some who are disappointed and now must spend even more money (if they have any left) to go somewhere else.  \r\n \r\nAre you making the right decision? Please take my suggestion so you can be better informed to decide for yourself.          \nCompared to Iowa prices of housing, you will probably experience sticker shock. Go to ForRent.com and try searching there for something in your price range. As for the people, you're going to find that, just like you,  alot of people are from somewhere else. You'll get the people who try to fit into what they think is the LA scene, and you'll get the LA bashers who regret moving here. But mostly everyone is doing like people do elsewhere - get up, work and plan your weekends.          \nAre you making the right decision?  I would say NO!  If you are unhappy in IOWA, I guarantee that you will be unhappy anywhere else & everywhere else that you decide to go in the world.  I have live in Los Angeles MOST of my life & I have lived in California ALL of the life.  I have seen so many people from small \"farm towns\" end up in the streets of L.A. & living in shelters after they sustained bodily harm from being beaten & mugged by the seasoned PRO's who come to Los Angeles to prey on young men & women who are from other states.  If you don't know much about how the world works, then Los Angeles isn't for you.  You could end up another statistic & be added to the long list of Jane Doe's who are still waiting for their body parts to be claimed & identified by someone from somewhere!  You have NO IDEA what you are about to do.  It is NEVER a safe place for anyone who is alone.  Your body parts alone are worth over $250,000 as a donor (card id or not) to the medical people.  This town is FULL of sicko's.  I urge you to seek some therapy & get your life on a better track before you unknowingly & unwittingly commit suicide.  If you enjoy the flesh trade, then you will fit right in.  Don't go to the clubs, because that is where they put GHB in your drink & take you out to their car to transport you for photo sessions & sexual exploitation.  You think I am kidding?  These people are also running legitimate & successful businesses that will hire you, help you, then help themselves to what they think is their \"property\"...you!  It happens to men & women.  Consider yourself warned.  The Salvation Army has a program that will pay your bus fare back to your hometown when you have had enough of Los Angeles.  All you need is a friend or relative with a valid telephone number in the town where you want to go back to & they make the call & arrange your transportation.          \nWe're already packed with people, please stay in Iowa.          \nwhen u come here u should go to downtown LA and you'll b happy like me!!! \r\nyay \r\n:}          \nIts expensive. Get a job before you moved. \r\nOkay here goes The cheapest city in LACITY is Watts, They are more afforable cities like Compton is next to Los Angeles. \r\nThe cheapest city is Compton. \r\nHere you could fing a new Town house for around 300,000 \r\nor a new house for around 470k yes 470k5bed4bathroom \r\n \r\nso i suggest you to rent if you could afford go ahead lol buy your house. \r\nWelcome to Los Angeles County          \nFirst, figure out exactly what it is that makes you unhappy now.  Don't expect that a change of scenery will magically make you happy.  Running away from your problems does not necessarily solve them.   \r\nIf you're determined to make the move, get a job first that pays well enough to live in a region with a higher cost of living.  It also helps if you have friends or family in a new area.  Since you know no one in LA, it might be pretty lonely there until you manage to make new friends. \r\nEvery region has its advantages and drawbacks. \r\nNo matter where you go, there you are.          \nHi,  Hawkeye! \r\nYou should have a job before you move here.  \r\nCount on everything being 40% more expensive (or more) than Iowa. The average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $1200 per month with an additional $1200 needed as a deposit.  \r\nIt was easy for me to make friends here. Try Long Beach, CA, it used to be called Iowa by the Sea. That's where I live and I like it quite a bit. I'm within walking distance of bars, restaurants, the beach and shopping. I just walked down the street to the bars and met people because they recognized I was new. Nobody ever tried to take advantage of me and sell me for black market body parts, lol! Just be sure to look at places close to the beach like Bluff Park or Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights. LB can be really bad in parts as can all of LA and Orange County.    \r\nI'm from another large city so there wasn't a culture shock for me.  \r\nThe job market is very tight here.  \r\nJust remember that even though you are moving to get out of IA because of your unhappiness, your problems will follow you here.

Keep enough money to get back if you need to.  \r\n \r\nBe aware, with out a college degree or job skills, it's unlikely you will find a job that pays well.

It's just plain stupid          \nim 14 did it for a few months then stopped on a dime. Why? I realised it didnt do sh*t for me. It didnt stop the bullies or the bull crap at home.

Support is the greatest thing anyone can give you! \nAs for the sleepover, depending on how long it has been wait for a bit. Then ask your parents again.

If your really worried about your mental health see a doctor so that he give give you a proper diagnosis and treatment and medication if need be. But it may just be a part the anxieties of growing up. I dont really know anyone who isnt self conscious about their body. If you want to be happier you have to take chances and go for the things you want. Try not to worry so much about what other people think because at the end of the day, its your life. They have nothing to do with what you are working towards and wont do anything for you. They dont feed you or cloth you so they dont need to have a say in how you conduct your life.          \nI admire the fact that your religious convictions are so strong and keep you going. \n \nI don't recommend anti-depressant drugs. Take a look at the dangers involved and the unscientific methods by which you get diagnosed with a mental illness by doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists. This school of mental healing is based largely upon conjecture and has less grounding in science than witchcraft. But don't take my word for it or the word of anyone else on this forum for that matter. Read the first link below which tells the facts from the mouths of actual psychiatrists and doctors. Get the facts before you make your choice:  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat you are feeling is caused by a combination of things: all of the failures you have had in life plus a collection of irrational feelings based on painful mental and physical experiences in your life, some of which you can partially recall on your own and some of which you can't yet recall at all. This is a scientific fact. It was proven in millions of cases. The reference is \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.\" It has been curing (not merely treating as doctors, psychology and psychiatry attempt to do) depression and anxiety and the feelings you are suffering from for over sixty years.   \n \nBest wishes, \nMatthew          \nI dont think its a good idea to list all of those 'problems' like that... it will make you feel worse about yourself, and you'll start believing that the problems are so severe that you wont be able to get over them. Like if you keep telling yourself that you have low self-esteem, you WILL have low self-esteem. \r\nYou care a hell of a lot of what other people think, and high school is hard enough, what with all the bitchiness and popularity and importance of looks. Trust me, i've been there. Every girl I know thinks they are ugly... or too fat... or too skinny. My best memories at high school are due to my friends. You are lucky to have a group of friends, so try hard to keep your friendship because most people only know how valuable it is after they lost it. \r\nAnd I think your best friend did help you- the answer is in talking to others. You obviously want to change your ways, and if you are really that determined to do so, then tomorrow, at school, you'll start talking to people more, smiling more... and build that up, every day. \r\nYou'll be fine, just make more of an effort with people. join some extra classes, like drama maybe, to help with confidence. Say yes if people invite you to places. \r\nIt'll be hard, but you've got to stay strong, and trust me, it'll be worth the effort. People mock others all the time, but you've got to keep your head high and the worse thing to do is feel sorry for yourself. \r\n \r\nIf you feel problems worsening, then do talk to someone... but when you start talking more to people and people start being friendly with you, you'll feel a high that will hopefully stimulate you to make more of an effort.  \r\nPlease stay happy. You are obviously a likeable person, so you'll be fine. Bless xx          \nHave you ever had to undergo authentic panic attack indicators? If so, then you know how anxious and possible fearful they can make a person. The main reason for that is you simply do not know when another one may happen. As you can already grasp, it is feasible to be able to make any type of guess as to when another panic attack episode will occur. Just in the US alone, almost 3 million people suffer form panic disorder which is frequent panic attacks. Well, think about all the undiagnosed people who have had just one panic attack, or maybe two, but nothing on a frequent basis. In this answer, we will go over bunches of signs of a panic attack, and possibly that awareness will aid in identifying others. \r\n \r\nSome of the extraordinary manifestations of a panic attack implying less physical sensations, at least in the impression we often think about them. Sometimes people experience symptoms involving feelings of being unreal. There is a feeling of hollowness, or feelings of marked extrication from one's actual being. As you can envision, that must be a rather problematical set of sensations to have to contend with, furthermore it can make a person feel really frightened and frazzled. Every now and then, signs of a panic attack can vary in force and most often cause a lot of horror according to the particular sign. Some people experience the feeling of having a blank mind. Then you have to realize that an indicator of a panic attack can last for a really long time, for example hours. Therefore, if the sensation is powerful enough, then just think about what it must be like to feel like your mind is vacant. That is not to say you will have that symptom if you have had others. There are some medical states that can cause a person to have an unfilled mind, and one of those is a stroke. \r\n \r\nFor some people, panic attacks affect their limbs and extremities. Symptoms can include numbness or tingling in the fingers and hands. A pinched nerve in the wrist, elbow, or spinal column is the typical cause of numbness or tingling sensations. \r\n \r\nThis particular symptom can also be indicative of a mild heart attack or some other related issue. So this causes confusion for the person who has these symptoms, and it's difficult to know what to think. This can strike in conjunction with other panic attack symptoms, as well.  \r\n \r\nTypically men experience different symptoms of a panic attack than women do. Similarities do exist, however. Men are about 50% less likely to suffer a panic attack. To help identify whether or not you're having a panic attack, try to make note of your symptoms and remember them in case of future attacks.

You need to talk with your sister and make her realize that this is her mistake, and it shouldn't be taken out on the baby. She doesn't want the baby? Fine. Put it up for adoption. As for you, tell who you need to. This will just keep getting bigger and bigger and it's not something you want to live with.          \nboyfriend is lucky it was your 18 year old sister and not you because if I was your father I would slap him with statutory rape charges so fast it would make his head spin. I don't think it is fair of your sister to put all of this pressure on you. He is clearly a creep that your oldest sister deserves to know about before she makes the mistake of her life and marries this man or worse yet, gets pregnant herself. If he's not cheating on her with your sisters he is probably doing it somewhere else. She is lucky she didn't get a STD or worse. The 18 year old might be upset with you for a little while for betraying her secret but you are right that it was her mistake and if she is adult enough to make that choice she is adult enough to accept the consequences. I believe the rest of the family will be grateful to you for revealing his true colors, that he came onto you and when he couldn't have it he went for your sister. He'll be out of your life and the pressure will be off you.          \nTELL \"SARAH\". she needs to know so that she can breakup with jamie....and tell chloe not to get an abortion. just like adoption or something.  also this is not your problem so the quicker you can make it so that youre not involved the better          \nHoney that's a big one!!!! But you can't carry someone's else's blame neither you didn't do anything. Taking the mask of that slum will help. If he's not welcome to the house that's great but maybe your sister is wondering why?? It's time to spill the beans over the table. It's not snitching it's being honest and respectful your sister broke those 2 rules and she must learn from her mistake. Sisters are sisters here there and in china so they will know how to work their differences and your big sister will open get eyes to the dirt bag she was with.if she's pregnant we'll that's just another consequence and the baby is not at fault. Now if your dad is comprehensive and close to you I would talk to him first as father and daughter. Explain the seriousness of the problem and that you don't want to be caught in the middle of the line of fire. He would know what to do since he sounds like a very serious and respectful responsible man.

Lies and hiding will just make it worse, and now there is a baby's life on the line. \r\nAbortion should not be taken lightly, it ends a human life and can leave women with depression and years, decades or the rest of their lives filled with regret and guilt.  Your sister, even though she made a mistake, deserves to keep this baby if she chooses to, and be supported,  She should not rush into an abortion as a cover up, that will just make things worse, and however mad your other sister is, I doubt she would want her niece or nephew killed over it.   \r\nI volunteer for a website that offers adoption info and free support for pregnant girls, and we understand how complex an unexpected pregnancy can be, and would be glad to help you or your sister sort through any issues.  You can email anytime, info@giveyourbabylife.com www.giveyourbabylife.com \r\n \r\nBottom line, once conceived, that baby is a unique, live human with DNA that will never be duplicated ever by any human on Earth.  This is your niece or nephew, and your sister, and both need to be protected and respected.  It's not the baby's fault, he or she is innocent, alive and deserves to stay that way.  Your sister can ask your other sister to forgive her, and the healing process, however it may progress, will be on it's way.          \nJust because you caught your sister having sex with a layabout, that does NOT necessarily mean that he is the father. Are you nuts?? \r\n \r\nLet your sister have the abortion, keep your mouth shut, and everybody is happy. You should also make sure that your sister is on the pill - she will not want this to happen again. Norplant is good, you don't have to remember to take it. Swear to keep your mouth shut if and only if your sister goes on the pill. \r\n \r\nMany people believe that unwanted children are more likely to lead a life of crime than wanted ones. So it is better for all of us if your sister does not add one more unwanted child to the world.          \nYou are responsible for telling your sister the truth--abortion will hurt her and will make a murderer of her and the boyfriend.  You know that this isn't right, if she doesn't listen then you need to do the right thing and tell your mom or sister or someone else.  A baby's life is on the line.  Follow your gut and do the right thing.          \nTell everything. Anortion is wrong and shouldn't happen. The only way this guy will permanently leave is if your sister breaks up with him. It will take a while but your sisters will heal in there relationship with eachother. You'll only get in trouble if your older sister finds out down the road and finds out you knew about it. Just tell your parents and sister.          ", "question": "\n    I really don't know what to do. \r\nOk so I'm 17 years old, my sister is 18 and my other sister is 21. We have a brother who's 23 but he's irrelevant in this (lol). \r\nOk I'll change names in this. My sister who's 21 (the one with the boyfriend) lets call her Sarah, and my sister who's 18 (slept with Sarah's boyfriend) lets call her Chloe.  \r\nAnd the scumbag boyfriend, we'll call him Jamie. *all names changed* \r\nOk so Jamie is a big of a man whore. He's tried it on with me (he's like 24) but I've rejected his advances, and haven't told anyone because I don't want to cause upset in my family. He's a slob, doesn't have a job who sits playing Xbox all day. My family are a family of hard workers so it angers me when he invites himself to our house and plays games. (He is however wary of my dad- who is high up in the police- my dad hates him because my dad is self disciplined and brought us up this way) and my dad lets him know this. Ok so about 5 weeks ago I walked in the house to hear blaring music coming from upstairs, I walked up to see it was coming from Chloe's room, (no surprise there) I pushed the ajar door to let her know I was home so she didn't get a shock if she turned her music off and heard noises downstairs. (Let me add I was home from college about an hour earlier than I should've due to well erm, woman reasons lol. Everyone else was out at work including my mom, dad Sarah and my brother) well as I pushed the door open I found Chloe and Jamie on Chloe's bed, at it. Chloe quickly realised and started to get dressed and explain herself while he lay there smugly. I didn't leave the doorway, demanding an explanation. Well after about an hour of coaxing, she explained it was just a silly mistake and no-one needs to know. I wasn't comfortable, but I didn't want to tear my family apart, however I'm still disgusted and protested to my dad I wouldn't be comfortable with Jamie in the house, and my dad agreed, which made Jamie no longer welcome at our house. Well I thought that was okay, until yesterday when my sister told me she was pregnant. She says its quite early and she doesn't plan on telling the family and just having an abortion. I don't know if I can keep this secret as well, it's her mistake and I'm suffering and feeling guilty, I don't want to betray her by telling Sarah and my family but I don't want to betray Sarah by not telling her and letting her carry on with his layabout man.

Don't worry, help is at hand :D. \r\n \r\nStealth - The drop really isn't that big, and once you're at the top and about to go down, the drop lasts two seconds and then you're down again. You NEED to ride Stealth because I honestly believe there's no point going to Thorpe Park if you're not going to ride it. Trust me, I tried avoiding it nearly all day, until 2 o clock, I got on it, rode it, and absolutely loved it! Do it! :) \r\n \r\nSaw > Sorry to inform you, it's a 100 degree drop lol. But really, the big big drop outside, is just like the drop on Stealth, over in a few seconds, and then you're put through an Immelmann loop and going on to enjoy the rest of the ride. There really is nothing to be scared of! As for the drop inside, it's nearly vertical, but not quite, maybe 80 degrees. You don't expect it and I'd say it's more fun in my case, for you though maybe, it may be worse. Just a short quick drop though, go for it, it's brilliant. \r\n \r\n \r\nRush > I have to say, you probably won't like this ride.

Supposedly in order to earn \u00a3300+ per month the requirement is to complete 26 tasks (more like surveys mostly from well known service providers etc) after which you can claim your earnings for all 26 tasks, you do not get any of your earnings if you don't complete all 26.  You can not move on to a task without completing the one before, so if there is a particular task you don't want to do then you don't go further and you lose out on the ones you have already completed.

Doesn't matter their sex - or mine.          \nAgreed.  Very much so.          \nI agree, but it doesn't irritate me that much.          \nHave you ever heard \"Ladies First.\" It's just the way it is.          \nWomen traded the \"door thing\" long ago for equality. Those who think they are entitled to a door being opened for them are living in the dark ages, but the first to scream equality...you cannot have it both ways. I do not have the same experience as you...doors are held for me whether it is a man or a woman. Common curtesy rules, not old fashioned rules. Be nice to people and they will be nice back to you.          \nIt's polite to hold the door for a woman.  Now is it necessary hellllll no.  But I prefer to be polite.  And I would walk through the door if mother Teresa was holding it open say thanks and continue on my way.          \nI open doors no matter who is behind me, except when i was at work and i looked back and this ***** was behind me i immediately let it go...lol.          \nYes I agree with you. I don't mind. Sometimes I open the door for guys all the time. What's the point? As long as you're helping someone. I also hate it when someone is carrying something heavy across the room and no one is there to open it for the other person. That is just messed up. Maybe they don't realize it, but then the door opens and close and opens and close because the other person cannot get through. LoL. It's just messed up. I don't know about those people who aren't respectable and have great manners. It pisses me off when someone close the door in my face or doesn't say thank you if I happen to open the door. One time, I opened the door for this girl, and she just walked out while texting and kept going, I should've slammed it in her face. Am I being a hypocrite here? lol. Oo wells. Damn people. =) Great question.          \nI tried NOT holding doors open for people and one lady got hit at quicktrip and said \"well thanks\" with extreme sarcasm. this irritated me, but from then on I just hold the door if its within arms reach. no prob.          \nIf a person (man or woman) is carrying a load, I'll open the door for them. \r\n \r\nIf someone opens the door for me, I'll tell them thank you and walk through. \r\n \r\nThe only time I had an issue with this, was back in the early 70's. I opened a door for a lady, because she had a briefcase and a bag of fast food in her hands. \r\n \r\nBoy, did she let me have it. She called me a sexist pig and did I think she was a helpless female, yadda, yadda. \r\n \r\nA couple weeks later here she comes again. She's got the briefcase, a stack of papers and it's raining cats and dogs. \r\n \r\nI get to the door first, I just walk in and let the door close behind me. She fumbles with the door handle and drops her papers in the water puddle. I'm standing about three feet away and I'm just watching her scoop up soggy papers. \r\n \r\nWhen she finally gets in, she asks why I didn't help her. I told her us sexist pigs don't like to get wet.          \nIt's just common sense and good manners to open a door for another person, regardless of sex.          \nIn a world where there is so little communication of a civilised nature - holding a door open is just a passing niceness for the world that says 'there you go, I acknowledge you exist'! \r\n \r\nIt is no big deal - if you feel like opening a door - do it. \r\nIf you don't - don't. Nobody will notice if you don't. But somebody may if you do. \r\n \r\nAs for females allowing doors to be opened - it to is a non-verbal acknowledgement that A GENTLEMAN has made a non-sexual tribute to a lady and that she appreciates it by going through the door and saying 'thank you'. \r\n \r\nIt is the little pleasantries in life that make a bad day bearable! \r\n \r\nHave a good day!          \nI have never in my life seen a woman insist that the door be opened for her, but if she did it would be completely rude, whether or not the man was holding something. Obviously if he must set anything down to open the door and doesn't do so freely, than that woman is beyond rude. \r\nI open doors for men all the time, but it's not really the same thing. I just do it because it would be rude to let it swing on him. If a man goes out of the way to open the door for a woman, than that is gentlemanly of him but not to be expected and certainly not demanded. \r\n \r\n \r\nAlso, I want to add that while the polite thing to do is say thank you, it is a greater offense to call attention to the fact that someone didn't. They may have something on their mind, just let it go.          \nDon't go shopping with girlfriends or wives, then.          \nI think you have FAR too much time on your hands if you're worrying about something as silly as this. \r\nI've never seen a woman \"insist\" that the man she is with hold the door open.  I have seen men who prefer to allow women to enter first, and I love this.  It's a sign of respect for a man to want to wait for a woman to enter in front of him. \r\nThere are so MANY women who get attitude when a guy walks ahead of them the poor men don't know what to do. \r\n \r\nNow, look around find a REAL problem.          \nI can see why that would annoy you.  It would definitely annoy me if I took the time to hold a door open for a person and refused it because I'm a woman! \r\n \r\nAs a child, I was taught that opening a door for someone is common courtesy, especially if that person is carrying something, elderly, physically disabled or pregnant.  I'll hold a door open for anyone, if I happen to get to it first.  It's just good manners.          \nI hear ya!!!! This is a good question!!!! I agree that whoever gets there first should just open the door. I mean really, i hate standing there (looking stupid) waiting for him to open my door, when I could have done it.  \r\nOkay it's like this, you pull up to the store, your usually in a hurry~~~while he is putting the car in park, taking the key out,getting out his self, walking around the car, then opening my door~~~~I'm on the way back to the car~~~~you know why?? CAUSE I CAN OPEN MY OWN DOOR!!!! I'll be later than all get out if I wait for him to open my door everytime we go somewhere!!!  If you get out or in yourself it really saves time~~~not to mention he's not my butler or the door man!!! \r\nAny woman who does not open their own door is just lazy or spoiled(and I don't mean spoiled in a good way!!)          \nyup. this is pretty stupid. but over here, we dont really see that many cases like this, cos man's and woman's roles here - in holding open doors at least - seem equal. \r\n \r\nbut - here's the very big BUT - the problem with our countrymen is that some ppl dont even bother to hold open the door for you. he/she holds it open for him/herself, then promptly lets go when he/she's done, and lets the door slam in your face. lol! that annoys me like ****. \r\n \r\nand yes, if i were to witness or experience an experience like what you described, i'd hate it to **** too. \r\n \r\nhumans are humans, and we are made with hands.          \nokay? u should join my yahoo group. we discuss annoying things like this. it's called haterz. just search it. or u can go on my 360 page and click on the link at the bottom. just click on my profile, and go to my 360.

WHAT THE HECK?!  That's just being sexist. \r\n \r\nBasically, I hate those \"macho\" guys and the girls who act too fragile to open their own door to the restaurant / car!

Why not just open the door REGARDLESS?  This is where I think the male and female roles go too far.  A woman can do anything a man can do and it's JUST a door.

Just let her know that you don't want to see her doing that again and if you do, you'll DEFINATELY tell on her. \r\n \r\n=]          \nTell your parents.  She'll hate you for it, but it's in her best interest.          \ndun tell on ur sister, it will cause a rift in ur r'ship with her. try to talk nicely to her and explain why u r concerned. \r\n \r\nat the end of the day, it is her life and her body and u can't tell her wat to do.. all u can do is try.          \nYou should tell em if your sister wasn't and her boyfriend weren't using protection. If they don't know about that yet, then they're too young.          \nDo your sister a very big favor... tell her that you're gonna tell your parents and whether she like it or not, tell your parents what you saw..no more no less.          \nwhere were your parents?  and should you tell?  no there is nothing to tell your story and then your sisters story          \nI think you should tell her that if she promises to stop what she's doing you promise not to tell.          \nI don't think you should tell your parents, unless you want to have your sister hate you for a long time.  I think you could do more good for her, if you maintain her confidence.  Remember though: in the end, you can't live someone else's life for them.  If she's bound and determined to have sex, neither you or your parents are going to be able to stop her...          \nBefore you tell on her you really need to just talk to her about all the risk and then if you catch her again, you should inform your parents. The reason I am telling you not to tell is because I know that if you become a tattle-tell in the eyes of your sibling, it is going to make it tough for you the two of you to get along. So don't complicate things just yet. Explain to her that you care deeply and tell her if you catch her again, you are going to your parents to ensure her safety.  \r\n \r\nGood Luck!          \nIf it was me in this situation i'd tell my sister that i care about her and don't want her to get hurt and tell her that i'd rather she was honest with me so when the time came that i needed someone to talk to i could rely on her. If you tell your parents she'll be angry at you and you may not have her support when it comes to you dating boys. \r\nTell her if she's going to have sex to be safe.          \nNo dont tell on your sister just let her know that you would rather her wait, you two are sisters just think if it was the other way around.          \nYou need to tell your parents so they can get a handle on your sister and the situation. If she is up to this no good at 14, she's going to have a pretty big track record before she's 18.  Who knows, STDS, pregnant, raped...if you care about her, i'd tell.  If something happened to her because you kept your silence, well, you have to live with it my man.          \nShe is too young to be having sex and \r\nshe might get pregnant or get STDs. \r\nTell your parents what she is doing. \r\nIf you don't tell she might do it again. \r\nYour parents should be the ones \r\ntalking to her about sex not you.  \r\nOnce they find out she will \r\nthink twice next time.          \nYou can advise her in a civilized tone. Also tell her is she\u2019s going to do it, use protection. Tell her the BF is a sissy for running away like that.          \nDon't  tell parents.  Talk about condoms and stuff first.

She said her boyfriend was wearing boxers and she was wearing a shirt.  I can't believe her because, 1. I saw what I saw and that was two NAKED people and 2. If they were that exposed to one another, it was probably going to lead to sex.  This was awkward for me, because she's only 14 and I'm only 13.  She told me not to tell our parents, and I told her I don't know what to do, which is true.  I can't imagine what my parents would do, because they get angry at her when she disapears for even 5 minutes with her boyfriend.

It doesn't matter what you believe, Satan works for God, always has and always will.          \nHell was created for satan and his demons. It was never meant for people. But people who dont believe in god, people who dont follow EVERY word of god, and people who dont repent, forgive, release anger away....they will be sent to hell. For no unclean thing and no un purity thing shall be in heaven. \r\n \r\nI dont need to read all what you wrote. If you read the bible then you know the truth. This is the truth.          \nPlain Bible passages say the sinner will suffer in Hell eternally (Mt. 25:46; Mk. 9:43-48; Re. 14:10-11; 19:20; 20:10).  The Bible also says the punishment of the unsaved will be worse than violent death (Mk. 9:42). This proves the punishment is not annihilation, but is eternal torment. (3) Jesus said it would have been better if Judas had never been born (Mt. 26:24). Jesus' words make no sense if Judas was only going to be annihilated.          \nEverlasting is a matter of interpretation. As a young child, 3 months is an eternity. To the adult, it speeds by. Also when we suffer, any amount of time is too long. Perception plays into the carnal estimation of \"everlasting\". Day and night does not exist in eternity since the universe is not a part of eternity with its stars, planets, time, matter, etc. Hell is a place where God isn't. As long as we are there, time passes slowly. God's nature is to punish, then restore...if there is repentance. If someone would rather simmer in hell than repent, that is their choice. And believe me, I've known people who said they would rather suffer in hell for eternity than bend a knee to God. That is the epitome of rebellion.          \nWe are all sinners because of Adam but some people will believe in Jesus and be born again John 2 \r\nWhich makes them a new person and they wont be called sinners because Jesus died in their place for their sins. The people that do not believe in Jesus will be included with the sinners and satan and his angels in the lake of fire.          \nYour source is dubious. It's pretty safe to assume no one is going to hell. Also, Satan and all other angels are imaginary.          \n \r\nThis excerpt quote from the Catholic Encyclopedia is very revealing:  \r\nIn the same way the Greeks and Romans may have worshipped their divinities, fondly believing them to be good. But the Christian Scriptures declare that all the gods of the Gentiles are demons.  \r\nCatholic Encyclopedia: Devil Worship  \r\n  \r\nDEMONS ARE THE GODS OF THE GENTILES!!!!  \r\n \r\nSatanism is not a Christian invention  \r\nSatanism predates Christianity and all other religions  \r\nSatanism is not about \"evil\"  \r\nSatanism is not about death  \r\nTrue Satanism is about elevating and empowering humanity to reach equality with the Gods, which was our True Creator (Satan's) intention  \r\n\"IN THE SECRET OF MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO GOD BUT ME\" \r\n-SATAN \r\nFrom \"Peace Be Unto Him\"  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nDue to centuries of misinformation, lies, and the systematic removal of knowledge, few people these days understand or even know what \u201cSatanism\u201d really is all about.  \r\n \r\nChristianity has been at liberty to dictate without any opposition, what they CLAIM Satanism to be. In order to accomplish this, the truth had to be destroyed. The Catholic Church (the original Christian Church, from which all Christian sects have evolved), heinously tortured to death and mass-murdered millions of innocent men, women and children in what was known as \"The Inquisition.\" Some children who were burnt to death in what were known as \"witch houses\" were as young as two years of age. \r\n \r\nChristians forever rant and rave concerning the \"one world order\" where all identities, cultures, personal privacies, and liberties will be lost and humanity, after being systematically bar-coded, will be lumped into a one-world slave state. What they fail to see is how their own so-called \"religion\" and bible have always been and are the roots of and blueprint for this regime. Everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible has been stolen and corrupted from religions predating Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from hundreds to thousands of years. Through Judaism and its tool of Christianity, all of the original spiritual teachings from around the world, (which are CONCEPTS) have been stolen from, lumped together into the \"one,\" and corrupted into Jewish archetypes and characters and fictitious places. This has given the Jewish people as a whole a false history, political power and \"spiritual\" authority to which they are not entitled.  \r\n \r\nThe bible is a very powerful subliminal tool to control the masses. One can see this is a man-made work as there are endless contradictions. The bible has been systematically drummed into the minds of the populace from a very early age. A lie must always be enforced as opposed to the truth which can stand on its own. Because spiritual knowledge and occult power have been removed and kept in the hands of a \"chosen\" few, the unknowing populace has been helpless against it. The agenda here is to create a one-world slave state with the \"chosen\" few ruling at the top. The perpetrators of course blame Satan to create a necessary distraction, while they use occult power to accomplish their ends. They have a history of stealing from and blaming their enemies for everything they really are and do, while always holding themselves in the highest esteem and innocence.  \r\n \r\nThe original religions now known as \"Satanism\" (by the way, \"Satan\" means \"enemy\" in Hebrew), were all based upon what is known as the \"Magnum Opus\" or Great Work. The one known as \"Satan\" is our True Creator God. He was prevented by the other Gods from finishing his work on humanity, that of the godhead. The godhead is physical and spiritual perfection. Now, if you continue to read on, I will prove this.  \r\n \r\nThe serpent is seen everywhere in ancient relics and structures. The serpent was held sacred in all areas of the ancient world. Satan is the God Ea, aka ENKI, one of the first of the Nephilim to arrive on this planet and establish the first civilization. In Sumerian mythology, Enki's symbol was always the serpent.  \r\nThe serpent represents the DNA, the life force and the kundalini and has survived as the emblem of the American Medical Association and Veterinary medicine, where it is symbolic of life and healing. Only with the coming of Judeo/Christianity, has this sacred symbol been desecrated and blasphemed.  \r\n \r\n \r\nNearly all of us are familiar with the term \"fallen.\" This word has been used copiously by Christian clergy to refer to Satan and his Demons. In truth, \"fallen\" pertains to the kundalini serpent (which has always been associated with our Creator God Satan), which has fallen in humanity as a whole and now lies dormant at the base of the spine. Because of this, humanity as a whole is on a very low level of spiritual understanding. Thoughtless abuses of children and animals, senseless wars, brutality and endless corruption are the results of the fallen serpent..... \r\n \r\n          \nIf all sinners went to hell, then that means every single person in this world would burn in hell, but only the people who believe in christ, and ask for forgiveness will be saved from the eternal fire.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110209115444AABIRq4", "answer": "\nA man should be a man, and open the door, give up his seat and take out the trash for his family. Nothing can make anyone more proud and cost nothing to do. And yes, a young woman should give her seat to any elderly or disabled persons in public areas. Could you imagine not opening the door for a soldier?? Who may have lost his hands or limbs to protect our wonderful country. Just keep that in mind before putting yourself \"first\". Open doors, say \"thank you\", and stand so others may sit even though no one else is doing so.          \nI think any young, healthy person should give their seat to anyone who is infirm, elderly or heavily pregnant. If you were ever pregnant you would agree with me. I hold the door open for women who have children or have them in a cart, not a 20 y.o. who's capable of opening a door. I don't expect anyone to open my car door, that's silly and wastes time.          \nI think being a gentleman, or for all that matters, being kind is never outdated.  I will open doors to the elderly, those with packages and swarm of children.  If they don't appreciate it, that's their problem.   \r\n \r\nAs far as opening doors, I walk through and hold it open for the next person.  I don't stand there and be a doorman, but I don't let the door slam on the face of the person behind me either.  The person behind me should say \"Thank you\" and we move on with our lives.          \nIt's interesting that you consider your views to be representative of New England. I grew up in Connecticut, outside New York and I have honestly never seen a woman refuse to go through a door because a man held it open for her and I've never heard anyone say anything about the sexism you seem to think is inherent in this gesture.  \r\n \r\nI agree that people should be treated equally, but I think that people should be treated equally well, whereas you seem to think that people should be treated equally poorly. I appreciate it when a man holds a door for me. I also appreciate it when a woman holds the door for me. And I will hold the door for both men and women. I never think about whether my actions or anyone else's are motivated by \"a code-book of social rules\" or some kind of sexism. I think people are just trying to be polite and considerate.  \r\n \r\nFrankly, I'd be just as baffled by that kind of ridiculous behavior as your friend from the South. He was being polite and she was being deliberately ungrateful. If everyone in your area behaves the same way, no wonder people think New Englanders are rude.          \nI like how you call your part of the country 'more enlightened' but then in the next paragraph they are 'very sheltered'. \n \nAs a man, I think women should be treated like queens.  That means I, as a man, open her door, give up my seat, pick up the check, etc.  To call that sexist or chauvinist implies that I'm doing those things because I think she can't or that I'm better at it.  The fact is, I'm performing those menial tasks because I think she shouldn't have to. \n \nClass doesn't enter into it at all.  I don't know where you got that.  And black people are still people, men and women.  And yes, I treat women differently because they are women and I am not, whether they're black, white or purple doesn't matter.  I don't demean them, I don't belittle them.  I offer them the luxury of not having to do the 'little things' in life like opening a door or standing when there's a perfectly good chair I'm sitting in.  If some women in your area or others, enlightened folks as you call them, see that as bad then they don't have to accept my gesture.  But stop acting like you're somehow better for doing so.          \nChivalry is a kind of \"booby prize\" that existed to make up for the fact that women didn't have the vote and were completely dependent on men.  It's always interesting to me how we have changed gender roles, but don't even realize how many components of our customs no longer make sense in the new system. \n \nAs to giving up your seat to a women, I disagree. Doing so implies all women are weak.   \n \nOpening the door for a women is a nice, harmless gesture I support. \n \nMy big issue is with career women who expect men to pay for dinner and judge boyfriends on earning capacity.  The \"pay for dinner\" thing came from a time when men had all the best jobs.  Getting equal access to the high-end careers means you get equal financial responsibility.          \nSigh.  I'm from the South and your part of the country sounds very cold, unwelcoming and unfriendly.  Social niceties make life, well, nice!  Why would that be a bad thing?   \r\n \r\nAnd, you can't really call good manners an \"old system\" just because they aren't practiced where you live.  Manners are very much practiced in other parts of the country. \r\n \r\nI recently moved to a part of the country where a large percentage of the population is transplanted Yankees.  Good manners and looking out for your fellow man are not the norm here.  Road rage, even to the point of murder, is not uncommon.  This is in no way better than where I came from where people helped each other, held open doors for each other, and didn't shoot each other over being cut off in traffic.          \nAs a woman I would never expect a man to give up a seat for me, or open a door for me. I do come from the South and I'd say doors are held for me quite often. This old system did suggest women were delicate. But I, and most women today are hardly delicate flowers. \nBut these are quick, simple gestures, and when someone holds a door for me I feel no connection to sex, just basic human kindness. I can't imagine getting angry, since the split-second intention for holding a door is genuine. Why not just say \"Thank You\" and pay it forward? \nAs for giving up his seat, I would protest strongly, but I am not going to be rude to someone who just wants to be nice. My taking the seat also brings this type person pleasure. He wouldn't offer otherwise. So, after protesting unsuccessfully I just take the seat. Why not, I won't complain about sitting. \nOn the other hand I always hold the door for a person to at least take a hold of if they are directly behind me, and always hold it for elderly people, pregnant women (having been there), and a woman with lots of kids in tow or person holding a lot in their hands. \nPeople are increasingly cold and hostile to strangers. That is far more upsetting to me than someone just trying in their own way to be nice. \n \nEDIT: CHAK-very interesting read! I don't think you sound chauvinistic at all. I do agree that it is still a time of transition in many places. You are right that it is important to follow the norms of an area as best possible.  \nI too struggle when I finally accept the seat that I didn't protest enough, or perhaps I appear lazy for taking it. But basically, I do so because (in this time of transition) the person offering was raised to do so and BELIEVES he is doing the right thing. Since the gesture is genuine, it would be pointless and petty of me to be offensive and refuse... it's such a little thing that honestly makes little difference in my life or his.          \nI'm from the Midwest and appreciate good manners and kindness.  I love being a woman and being treated well by the men I encounter.  I was raised by southern parents who taught us proper etiquette.  I am often appauled by the lack of respect people show each other these days.  On the other hand, I've experienced young people with lovely manners.  \r\n \r\nI am an independent woman and have always been capable of doing for myself.  It's just so nice when people remember their manners and put forth a little effort.  I guess, if your parents didn't teach you these things, you probably don't know what's appropriate.  A rule of thumb: it costs nothing to be kind and generous, and it makes everyone feel so good.  I applaud all the 'gentlemen' out there; you are appreciated.          ", "question": "\n    Recently another user asked a question about who he should give up a subway seat to. He said that he knew he should give it up to people who are old or carrying a lot of packages (I agree), but wanted to know about the gray areas. \r\n \r\nBasically a lot of users said that a gentleman should always give up his seat to ANY woman regardless of her age, or to any \"elder\" man (regardless of his physical ability to stand). Similarly, a woman should yield her seat to an elder man, etc. \r\n \r\nThis is all very interesting to me. Where I grew up (in the socially liberal Five-College area of Massachusetts) if you held a door for a female, or offered a seat, you were were (and are) a male chauvinist. A friend from the South was baffled when he held a door for a girl, who glared at him and refused to walk through. \r\n \r\nNow that I'm just slightly older, I agree with the traditions of my birthplace: people ought to be treated equally. No special treatment nor special restrictions based on race, sex, or religion. Females have legs that work just as well as anybody else's legs. \r\n \r\nI grew up where Dutch dating, letting women open their own doors, and giving them a firm handshake are all the norm, and doing otherwise is considered unacceptable evidence of sexism by many males and females alike. \r\n \r\nI consider myself fortunate to have been born in a more enlightened part of the country (yes I know, New England ego-centrism springs eternal). But I think I mean it. It promotes a type of relationship among people in society that is very healthy in my opinion. \r\n \r\nThe people where I live are (I *think*) just as nice and kind-hearted as people anywhere, and if you have a cane, or a load of packages in your hand, they will give you their subway seat in a heartbeat, *and* their acts of generosity are motivated by a genuine sense of kindness, not adherence to a code-book of social rules.

(PS....does not matter how you live to be one with God)....How you live has its own circumstance and consequences that are the same for those who choose heaven OR hell          \nYes, you're right. The problem of evil has always been a difficult one for Christians and other religious people. If God created everything, then he also created Satan. If god is all-knowing (omniscient) and he created Satan with the full knowledge of his turn to evil, then surely God knew he was creating something which would tempt men to be evil. Surely this was an evil act in itself. \r\n \r\nThe only alternative is that God didn't know what was going to happen. Christians often say that we, and god's creations have free will. But that still doesn't explain why he created Satan or why he allows evil. \r\n \r\nHere's your options: \r\n1. God is evil \r\n2. God doesn't know everything \r\n3. It's all a load of old BS          \nIt is. God is working to keep people out of Hell.  \r\n \r\n2 Peter 3:9  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. \r\n \r\nEzekiel 18:23  Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?          \nAre you joking? then everybody would be there. And I have other plans. \u2665 \u2020 \u2665 \u263a \r\n \r\nTa-ta.          \nactually it is the devil's job to seduce you and push you to make that most sins so as to go to hell,,, so actually the devil is trying to send you to hell... \r\n \r\nalso no you won't be tortured in hell endlessly for small mistakes,,, as a muslim we belive that you will be tortured endlessly in hell if you commit the biggest sin and crime ever on earth that is not warshipping the one true and the only true god.... \r\n \r\n112.001 Say: He is God, the One and Only;  \r\n \r\n112.002 God, the Eternal, Absolute;  \r\n \r\n112.003 He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;  \r\n \r\n112.004 And there is none like unto Him.  \r\n \r\nso if you believe in god as the way above and then you commit some sins you may be tortured in hell an amount relative to those sins and then you will go to heaven.... also if you regret a sin and stop doing it allah may forgive you and you may not be tortured at all for that sin \r\n \r\nI have more answers and explanations but just wanted to make things short and nice..........          \nPlease understand that God doesn't send anyone to hell. Hell is a choice. You have two options: Heaven or Hell. It's a 50/50 chance. God won't force you to choose. You have to make that decision by following God or not. \r\n \r\nGod's door to heaven is open and he is calling out to us to enter. If we reject his offer then we have chosen to stay outside, which is hell. \r\n \r\nI hope this was helpful.          \nNo, it is the work of my own past deeds; it was in my hand but I messed it up and I am bound to reap its consequences to wipe it off for good in future.          \nperhaps the devil we give safe harbour to inwardly... here is an interesting perspective on hell, being not \"eternal\" as we have been told but just a very long time of dissolution the responsibility of which rests squarely onlur shoulders: \r\nELEMENTARY SPIRITS. -- Properly, the disembodied souls of the depraved; these souls having at some time prior to death separated from themselves their divine spirits, and so lost their chance for immortality. Eliphas Levi and some other kabalists make little distinction between elementary spirits who have been men, and those beings which people the elements, and are the blind forces of nature. Once divorced from their bodies, these souls (also called \"astral bodies\") of purely materialistic persons, are irresistibly attracted to the earth, where they live a temporary and finite life amid elements congenial to their gross natures. From having never, during their natural lives, cultivated their spirituality, but subordinated it to the material and gross, they are now unfitted for the lofty career of the pure, disembodied being, for whom the atmosphere of earth is stifling and mephitic, and whose attractions are all away from it. After a more or less prolonged period of time these material souls will begin to disintegrate, and finally, like a column of mist, be dissolved, atom by atom, in the surrounding elements.

Yours could be something like: \n \n[ 3 . 2 | 5 ] \n[-2 . 4 | 9 ] \n \n(I've put x first there,  \n \nThe three types of elementary row operations are: \n(a) multiply each element in a row by the same nonzero value \n(b) exchange any two rows \n(c) add a constant multiple of one row to another \n \nAny of those will produce a new system with exactly the same solution set. \n \nWhat you'd like to do is get the system in the form: \n \nx = a \ny = b \n \n...which is already solved.  The augmented matrix for that system is: \n \n[ 1 0 | a ] \n[ 0 1 | b ] \n \n...since x=a is the same as 1x + 0y = a, and y=b is the same as 0x + 1y = b. \n \nThat's where the \"alternating 0 and 1\" pattern comes from.  Left of the vertical bars is a square matrix that is 1 on the \"main diagonal\" from top left to bottom right, and 0 everywhere else.  That particular square matrix is called the \"identity matrix\", and you'll see it a lot later on. \n \nGoing back to your original system, get a 1 in row 1 column 2 by multiplying row 1 by 1/3 (type a row operation): \n \n[ 1 . 2/3 | 5/3 ] . . . .

In fact, I'm pretty sure Keanu Reeves played the lead role.          \nIt's not as bad as \"The Green Slime.\"  Close, but no cigar. \r\n \r\n          \nIf only you had created the universe you could define all these rules, aww shucks          \nit was good for that children's fantasy book.          \nTo be fair, it could be a GOOD B-movie. Let's say they got Russell Mulcahy to direct, and Christopher Lee as Satan, Bruce Campbell as Jesus...          \nSci-fi B movies at least usually try to have some kind of coherent plot, with a few action set pieces and usually at least one plucky girlfriend/damsel in distress to maintain interest. \r\n \r\nThe heaven/hell thingie doesn't even have that.  There's no decent characters.  No dialog.  No love interest.  There's not even a scene where the scientist hero finally convinces the authorities that the danger is real, and comes up with some wildly implausible pseudo-science to save the day (\"We'll spray the aliens with Gatorade!  The electrolytes in the fluid will react with their alien nervous systems, making them overload and explode!!\"). \r\n \r\nThere's no third act at all - it barely qualifies as an interesting setting, let alone a whole movie. \r\n \r\nThe Killer Shrews is both more believable, and more interesting.          \nit's complete crap. \r\n \r\nthe hell and heaven concept. \r\n \r\nwhat i find even more odd that people that believe deeply, say your path is already written for you. \r\nif this is the case then dictators never did have a choose and hell is not \r\njustice. \r\n \r\nit's so black and white it hurts the color specter of nature          \nAll have sinned. Sin separates us from God. God sent His Son to die so we don't have to be separated from Him. I'd say He is a loving God.          \nNo need to rant. What if I told you that that was not necessarily the way. There  are others who feel like you and they are Christians. If you want to do more than rant look at this web site. Maybe it can explain a lot for you.           \nI hear what you are saying and I agree with you that there are many good people who are not christians.  There are many that do good and live a Godly life, that do not have faith in the Lord. \r\nGod deals with us individually in different ways, according to the person.    \r\nMost people come to know and love God in God's time, not ours.  We have no right to judge and condemn anyone for their actions or how they choose to believe.  This is God's department, alone and He needs no help from us. \r\nIf everyone spent as much time in their own affairs as they do in others, well this world would be a whole lot different, wouldn't it \r\nI love God with all my heart and I know God loves all of us, with all His heart.  God sends no one to Hell.  He does not wish this on anyone and He will stand by us our whole life, just in case we change our minds about Him.   He gives us every opportunity to acknowledge His love for us, until our moment of passing.          \nMaybe you'd enjoy exploring the various views about hell.  Your question is geared only toward the firey pit definition.  There is some interesting history surrounding where the word came from and its original use.  You may be surprised by what you discover that is consistent with a loving God.          \nokay \r\n1.\"god is a loving god\" god gave adem and eve a choice to obey god and not eat from the tree of knowledge but saton tempted theM.  god warned them and told them that we would all be damned to hell. but they fell into temtation and we were all supposed to go to die but then god died on the cross for us to SAVE US FROM THE TEMPTATION,sin. he gave us a chance for ourselves to either believe in him or not. so technically if god didnt die for us(which he did it b/c he love us) then wed all be in hell. we ALL deserve to go to hell.even a precious new born is a sinner b/c its human. we have sinful natures. all of us do!  \r\n2\"the ones who deserve to go to hell....murders rapists,and etc.whatever u said\" SIN IS SIN.

I think so. \r\n \r\nIt's just odd to me that a \"loving god\" would send people to hell, even if they refuse to live by his standards and love him as he does in return.  It's just cruel.  Just because people aren't \"christians\" doesn't mean they aren't good people, and help others, just because you don't believe.. you certainly don't deserve hell.

He even died for our sins which means He is loving. You have to save yourself and He has told you how and died for you, so if you don't want to go to hell, read Acts 2:38.          \nIt's not god or anyone else send you to hell, it's you and what you believe in that sends you to hell.          \nApparently, not believing in something is enough to sent to be 'hell', Because that is what love is.          \nNow THAT is what I have been asking for a long while. I used to go to church when I was younger and asked those questions....nobody like it when you ask things like that or use common sense.          \nI always wondered about that myself. But fairytales don't always make sense.          \nHell is a pretty big topic that can't be covered adequately in one post. I recommend listening to this podcast on the topic \"how could a God of love send anyone to hell?\":  \r\n \r\nAs for aliens, the Bible doesn't say anything about whether there is life on other planets or not. Most Christians would say that there are not, but we cannot rule them out entirely. However, if there are aliens on other planets, then we'll find out when we meet them.          \nChristians say that people \"choose\" to go to Hell, which is palpably absurd.  By their own admission, their God created Hell.  People only go there because He chose to make such a place. \r\n \r\nTheir God is not loving.  He's an officious, tyrannical megalomaniac who wants everyone to sing His praises.  There is nothing loving about that.          \ngod is perfect therefore he cannot let imperfectness into heaven. It's very simple. Those people who are cleared of their sin through jesus christ are perfect when they get to heaven, it would be unfair to let sinners into heaven so there ya go :)          \nA \"loving God\" would not. A \"loving God\" would not have created hell in the first place. \r\n \r\nOnly a jealous, vicious, sadistic, merciless, blood-thirsty 'God\" would. \r\n \r\nCitations: \r\n \r\nExodus 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. \r\n \r\nIsaiah  45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. \r\n \r\nMatthew 10:34 - 37 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.          \nReligion always loses rational arguments.          \nsuck wind - \"he doesn't. you send yourself to hell. Its ALWAYS been that way.\" \r\n \r\nI've always loved this argument. \r\n \r\nIf I travel to another country and beat someone within an inch of their life for not sending me a Christmas card, *I* didn't beat them up, they beat *themselves* up.          \nHe doesn't send any one to hell. Since He is a perfect God, he cannot allow sin, which is imperfection, into heaven. he sent Jesus to take our sin and render us clean, so that we could get into heaven. So he actually wants us to be with Him, and tried to make it fairly easy for us to do so. The problem is that people don't believe in Him and simply deny Him. So, since they are still consumed with sin, they make their own choice which, sadly, is hell.          \nHe wouldn't, hence this being one of the great logical problems with Christianity.  Don't let any of the fundies tell you \"you decide to go to hell,\" as such statements reflect their lack of thought on the issue. \r\n \r\nFor example: \r\n1. God is omnipotent \r\n2. God is good \r\n3. Evil (or hell) exists \r\n \r\nThose three cannot all exist together.  For, if God was omnipotent and good, he would have already driven out evil (not in some future, dramatic, threshing floor end times).  Permitting evil to exist even a little bit right now is evidence that he is not omniscient (actually he doesn't exist, so all of this is academic speculation).          \nGod created the world so that we would worship him. If he just removed Hell there would be no motive to worship him because Christians and non-Christians would have the same fate. God gives you a chance to turn yourself around so that you don't HAVE to go to Hell. If you choose not to, you're on your own.          \nYour first answer is the standard argument. It requires that someone be confused enough to think we can have free will while God also knows what we will do before he \"creates\" us.  \r\n \r\nA loving being would not even create a hell, much less send anyone there.          \nJesus said \"if you deny me on earth, I will deny you before my Father in heaven.\" \r\n \r\nif you deny God, what makes you think you have any kind of right to be in heaven with Him? also, if you don't believe, why would you want to be anywhere with anyone whom you don't believe in or have faith in?  \r\n \r\nyou to have your cake and eat it too. you either accept God or reject God and then deal with the consequences that follow.  \r\n \r\nit doesn't work that way.          \nGod is NOT sending people to hell. People are sending themselves to hell. God doesn't like it when people go to hell, it hurts God and make him unhappy. Its your choice if you go to heaven or hell.          \nEvery single person on earth deserves Hell. We are sinners and that's what we deserve. God gave his only son so that we could all have a choice. We can decide for ourselves weather or not we want to go to heaven or hell. God is not Sending anyone to hell. We do that ourselves. God is a Merciful God. He wants us to serve him, and our reward for doing that is heaven. He's not condemning us to Hell, but wanting us in heaven. I hope this helps you. :)          \nHe doesn't send you to hell. You do that all on your own. If God didn't give us choice, we'd all be robots with no love or emotions at all. If God \"removed\" hell, then we would obviously all end up in heaven, and in heaven you worship Jesus for all of eternity. He isn't going to MAKE you worship him, so you wouldn't even want to be in heaven unless you truly loved him.          \nHell is punishment. Jesus does love you and wants you to love and believe in Him. If you don't then you recieve your eternal punishment. As for \"Satan torturing people in hell\", read the Book of Revelation and see what happens to Him.          \nThere is no life, literally no life, outside of God.  Whatever it is that is outside of God, we call hell.          \nSee God is a complex and confusing subject. the bible says we are terrible sinners and god made hell for sinners. But it also says he sent his son to die on the cross. It says he's merciful but sometimes I get confused on the god stuff. Christians don't believe in aliens, well at least 97%. Few do and believed there could be other creatures but God loved them as well. Alot of Christians say Christianity was always in the beginning and its not a sect from Judaism but that doesn't make sense.  \r\n \r\nIts in the Bible that Jesus was the Kings of Jews. Plus, Gods says everyone is a sinner so it wouldn't matter if they were Jewish, Hindu, or Bhuddist          \nSome people are arbitrary in how they define words. One of my friends said that in a child's story, someone said, \"A word will mean just whatever I choose it to mean!\" Such is the case with Christians. It is hardly a \"loving deity\" who would burn billions of people forever for such a trivial matter as not believing in him. I do not care what ants believe, and if gods exist, we are ants to them. If he wanted people to believe in him, he would have shown us some proof he exists, rather than giving us such a poorly-written book as the Bible that has so many silly contradictions and so much ignorance of reality. If the Bible was really the word of a deity, such a deity would be as ignorant as the ancient Hebrew shepherds who began the Bible, or he would be a psychotic demon who wants any feeble excuse at all to torture billions of his creations forever. Logic shows us the truth of the matter. Primitive Hebrews obviously wrote the first books of the Bible, and they tried to scare people to make them do as they wanted. From my observation, some Christians believe space aliens exist, but others say the universe was created only for humans.          \nWhy would a potter use one pot to preserve jewels in it and use another as a dust bin? \r\n \r\nWhy do you write tests & exams? \r\n \r\nWhy should a company choose to recruit you when compared to others? \r\n \r\nGod could have controlled you & me like rocks & mountains. Why did he give us the freedom to decide what we liked to do? He should have made us like robots. \r\n \r\nSimple, It is a qualification test. A company has so many levels of strict interviews and eligibilities  to recruit someone to become a employee (partner) in the goal of earning profit. \r\n \r\nHow much more strict should the king of kings be inorder to recruit people for his kingdom. God has His own guidelines that He strictly adheres to. Life on Earth is to be sifted like gold. Its not that very easy task to please the supreme.  \r\n \r\nBut the good news is there is a Way.

{"url": "https://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090511122002AA2T8uV", "answer": "\nI personally think it is too much information.  I think people want short and sweet.  You should tell them about the ages you accept, the times you are available and your experience.  You don't want to sound desperate.  Then when they call and ask about the Daycare, then you provide them with all of the other information.   Most people just want the facts not all that other information.  Too much and they won't read it.          \nYou have way to much information here and you need someone to edit this for grammar and punctuation. You also do not want to advertise that someone has watched up to 12 infants at one time; I would never leave my child with someone who is irresponsible enough to think they can care for that many babies at once, they even have a law about it for home day cares.          \nFirst, this may be just me but I would not respond to your ad even though you have a lot to offer. You typing every word in a cap makes it hard for me to read and I made myself so I could answer. Your spelling is bad, usage of language incorrect. That again may just bother me but if you are teaching my children its my issue. \r\n \r\nThe CAPS, yuck \r\nYou write \"Just Let Me No \", it would be, just let me 'know\" \r\nyou write Home Day CAre At are house , that should be ' at our house\" \r\nYou use are instead of our several times. \r\n \r\nIt may be that english is a second language for you so these things do get confusing.  If you could get someone to sit and proof read with you I think you could set up some business. \r\nI have done this and would advise that you are offering a litte ahead of what you need to deliver. Set up a business then expand.  \r\nYou need set hours at first, say 6am to 6pm. Do not offer over night or extended care until you are set and stable. Do not offer out call, baby sitting services. You are running a day care not a sitter service. If you go to homes then there is no assistance at the home. Unless you go after hours on your own. \r\nYou will need to have two people in the home at all times.  \r\nAlso posting on Craigs list means you'll have to get a license I read. That may be wrong but if you offer a business from home you will need a license to care for more than a couple of kids. \r\nGood luck here, I hope it works for you. \r\nJust go slow so the promblems of start up are easy to overcome.          \nI have been a licensed child care provider in my home in Michigan for 21 years.  I actually am not exactly sure what your question is, but I am going to assume you are wanting to know if your Craig's List posting is a good ad.  What you have written here sounds OK, but it does contain several spelling errors which makes it a bit difficult to read.  It also seems to go on and on making it a bit hard to follow.  If I were looking for an in-home child care and saw an ad that said the care givers would come to the family's home, I'd probably skip over your ad since you can't provide care in your home in addition to going to someone else's home.  No one could be in 2 places at one time.  I, personally, have never even looked at Craig's List and I don't do any advertising for my daycare on that site.  I find local, word of mouth exposure keeps me as busy as I'd like to be.  If Craig's List is the only place you've put out the word and you aren't getting any calls than it is time to expand your advertising.  First, if you are a licensed facility check into organizations such as Child Care Network that works with licensed centers and home and helps match up those with openings with families needing care.  If you aren't licensed, this may be a problem for some people, especially if your state requires a license.  In Michigan, if you regularly care for an unrelated child in your home you must be licensed through the state.  Each state sets their own daycare regulations, though.  You should also spread the word by telling your friends, family, neighbors, church office, local elementary schools, local pediatrician offices, etc. that you are doing daycare.  Post ads in places were moms go like the laundrymat, the grocery store, and any other public bulletin boards you have in your area.  You also need to consider the economic climate currently in our country.  Many areas are hard hit by closing businesses which is leaving many families with only one working parent thus elminating the need for daycare.  Even if both parents have managed to keep their jobs, they may very well know a close friend or family member who lost their job so they withdraw their children from daycare and pay their friend or family member to care for the children to help them out.  Nearly all the home daycare providers I know are down in their enrollment and several have gone out of business.  Most daycare centers are also down in enrollment in our area.  I have not received a call inquiring about daycare openings since before Christmas when usually I get about 2-3 per month.  If you spread the word about your daycare and don't receive any calls, my guess is going to be that your area is struggling economically, too, and there just aren't any families in need of daycare at this time.          \ni would check your spelling and grammar;  there are many mistakes in there, and for what you are offering i would expect you to be a little more educated.  lack of spelling and grammar skills shows lack of education...just my opinion.          \nIf you need to include all of this information you will need to do a spell/grammer check.  Your use of caps makes it very hard to read.  Your usage of words just in the additional details edit are simple mistakes that are easy to fix.  example: To Much Info -should be Too much info....      Have Tryed That - should be have tried that......    It is little mistakes like this that could be critical to potential clients.  People judge on the material content as well as how it is presented - your first impression just with the errors would be a turn-off for me as a parent, regardless of what the information contains.          \nOh my goodness way to much info at once.I wouldn't even read it all.It seems like your trying to hide something so your putting so much info and adding all these things you do.Not that you are I'm sure your great people but,as a parent I'd think your trying to hard.Also I didn't like how you said you can call are cell.I think It be better if you'd say you may contact us at such and such.Also you shouldn't say my home or your home because It's either you have  daycare openings at your house or your looking for a job to watch kids at there house.Also how you typed it make is as if you are screaming.I'm not trying to be mean I just want you to know how i['d feel as a parent.Since you wanted the truth right?Good luck just try to keep it simple then you can meet them face to face to tell them the great things you offer.Try to go over your grammar and spell check because parents can get really crazy about that.If they hire you to teach there children then they are going to see how you grammar and all that is.Believe me i can't write for anything as you can see lol.Some people are very crucial about that.Just spell check or ask someone to help go over it with you.That's what i do.Best wishes hope you get what you want.
