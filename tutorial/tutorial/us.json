[{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140327110233AARqw12", "answer": "\nDaft Punk; they took electronic music and modified it into something both soulful and electronic. Thus making it pop music.          \nThere are ton of artists that have marked the history of the music,  \nlike Neil Young, Les Paul \nThose two have made a difference in the music. \n \nFor example: Les Paul was the first one to plug an electric guitar and he could make a system where you could record one instrument at the time when all the band had to play at the same time to record the song  \nNeil Young practically created a new genre and he is called the godfather of the Grunge          \nThe answer to that question will depend on the age of the responder.  Elvis & the Beetles have long been touted as the greatest of ALL time; yet both of them were influenced by somebody else that I've never heard of!!!  Personally, I love Stevie Ray Vaughan & he stated that he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix; yet, I don't care much for Hendrix's music!!!  Michael Jackson was also known to be a great talent; but he's another who didn't appeal to me!!!  My Grandmother was a huge Frank Sinatra fan; but we don't hear much of his music unless Michael Buble is on the air.  Buble is know for being a good artist...NOT a great artist.  Generations taste in music change from one to the next; so, I'm NOT convinced that there is any ONE person who I've ever heard of that has had the MOST impact!!!  IF I had to pick ONE, I would say it was the very FIRST person who ever sang the first song because their influence spread from there until now!!!          \nI hate to say this but Justin Beiber has had a massive influence. If not on music, then on how the up and coming generation sees it. The amount of screaming 9 year olds that know everything about him but not Freddie Mercury seem to be the majority. It's not a good thing, but that's the way the media wants to sell it. \n \nIt will probably bring about temporary death of good music until there's another music rebellion like in the 1950's.          \nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini. \nLike a lot of classical musicians, he lived in a music world where everything was about music. Therefore able to create impressive fingerings on the violin rather than just following traditional ways of fingering.  \n \nBut a lot of the older classical musicians were impressive. Their works lasted centuries and will continue to last for a very long time.          \nAfter considerable thought and eliminating several contenders, my opinion is that J\u00a0S\u00a0Bach may have had the greatest influence.\u00a0 He developed counterpoint virtually single-handedly from its crude predecessors.\u00a0 He solved all the basic problems in composition, and modern composers, in the first years after they learn their craft, frequently turn to Bach to \"see how he did it\". \n \nHe's largely responsible even for how we tune our instruments to make complex music playable.\u00a0 Previously, the pitches in the tuning system were based on simple ratios devised by ancient Greeks, called \"just intonation\", which allowed playing in single keys.\u00a0 For example, an instrument tuned for C would sound fine played in that key, but unpleasant played in E. \n \nFor wind and non-fretted sting instruments, where adjusting pitch is possible, the players eliminate the problem.\u00a0 For fixed-fret and keyboard instruments, however, this is not option, and retuning is necessary to play in another key. \n \nBach championed \"equal temperament\" tuning, in which notes are tuned very slightly lower or higher than just intonation would call for, evenly distributing the tuning discrepancies to make possible all keys on fixed-pitch instruments. \n \nThese pitch adjustments are built into electronic instruments, and accomplished on guitar and similar instruments by relocating the frets very slightly from their \"ideal Greek\" single-key placements.\u00a0 Without equal temperament, modern pop and classical music is simply not practicable\u00a0\u2014\u00a0you could play it, but you wouldn't want to hear it.          \nPatti and Mildred J. Hill, the composers of the melody for \"Happy Birthday to You\".          \nBritish Invasion, 80's New Wave/Punk, then rap... There's alot. Depending on time and opinion.          \n\u3000 Now you did ask of Musician only, not plural, or bands or groups, and that changes some attributes to whom we think is our favorite, to who may be most well known attributed artists in the field,  \n \n\u3000 What we miss out on overall , is someone like Beethoven, where without many a written song by him has been keyed upon many thereafter,  \n \nLudwig van Beethoven \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 Thereafter, It would then be individuals alike Elvis and Micheal Jackson,  \n \nElvis Presley \n \nMicheal Jackson,  \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 The list can be longer than any one individual applicable, even unknowns to us from other parts of the world,  \n \nGlenn Miller , Lawrence Welk , Paul McCartney, Elton John,  \nEric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Bob Marley, ... \n \n..          \nMany people consider Paul McCartney the most successful artist of all time, due to the level of popularity his songs co-written with John Lennon have achieved, as well as the amount of singers who have covered his song 'Yesterday', though many would perhaps stick with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, all of them popular in their day and nowadays.          \nObviously the honor should probably go to one of the early classical composers.  However, unless you are a musical historian it would be difficult and too far removed from recent history for the average person to contemplate.  In recent time I would have to say Elvis Presley, even though there are many musicians whom I prefer.  The majority of people within the past half-decade listened to either rock, country, jazz or gospel.  Elvis was the first to take the fledgling genre of rock and combine it with elements of most other genres.   He was among the first to use electric guitar within his band as the backbone to his music.  He was definitely the first  musician of high popularity to incorporate energized movements into his performance.  He also had a wide appeal to people of varying race and musical taste.   Almost all subsequent rock or pop musicians cited him as among their earliest influence.   Twenty years from now most of the nation's or world's populace won't know a clue about current names on the charts.  However, I am certain that even a century and more from now Elvis will still be known (and he might even still have a few 'impersonators' in Vegas.)       \n \nElvis:  the very first rock-n-roll 'star'          \nMichael Jackson, thats all i have to say.          \nOwl City  \nEDIT: 4 dislikes? what do people have against Adam? His music is amazing.  \n          \nScott Joplin had the most impact on popular music as a whole. He was one of the first musicians to incorporate syncopation into music. Doctors of the late 1800s and early 1900s thought syncopation was unhealthy and could cause irregular heart palpitations. Obviously that was proved wrong. \n \nThere's no popular song today without some syncopation in it. Scott Joplin (also known as the \"King of Ragtime\") wrote many famous rags that many people could recognize today, like \"Maple Leaf Rag\" and \"The Entertainer.\" Ragtime gave rise to Jazz, which gave rise to Rock and Roll, which gave rise to Hip Hop, which gave rise to 99% of today's popular music. \n \nIn my opinion, Scott Joplin is the unsung hero of popular music.          \nElvis Presley.He brought people together.He helped to transform basic blues and gospel music and took it to the masses.He had one of the best voices in history.A remarkable vocal range. \nMost of all he made it believable that a kid from an ordinary background could make it.A huge influence on virtually every pop/rock artist since.          \nHiphop now some hiphop I hate. Snoopdog some of his songs are cool. Hiphop express all types of feelings anger, happy, sad, and etc.          \nGive me thumbs down, but i like one direction...          \nJimi Hendrix but I have to agree with LadyMarisaa too          \nMy favourite solo artist is Michael Jackson as far as I'm concerned nobody can or will ever touch his vocal ability or his stagecraft he (in my opinion) was the greatest solo artist ever. As for favourite band there are so many bands that i love to choose from but i have to say Guns N Roses (1986-1996 line-ups) they were the first band i heard when i actually started listening to music when i was about 5 years old and I first heard \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and I was hooked been a gunner ever since and will be till i die (now that's devotion lol)          \ndefintly michial jackson          \n3pac \n \n \n \nHe doesn't give a hoot.          \nWhen you consider music it would largely rule out people like Elvis and Michael Jackson as they are not predominantly musicians - singers, performers, entertainers. \n \nFor a real answer I would pick someone like Antonio Stradivarius for making violins which hundreds of years later are still individually and collectively considered to be the greatest instruments ever made. \nOther than him the great composers like Beethoven whose music is still played today and have inspired great music still being produced for movies today. \nI like the other answerer who said J.S. Bach. \n \nFor more modern influences on music I would pick someone like Elvis or John Lennon.          \nI'm going to have to go with the classical musicians, specifically the likes of Beethoven and Pachelbel.          \nI'll name a few: \nJohnny Cash, Bob Marley, and Gordon Lightfoot. \n \nGordon Lightfoot because his talent of writing songs has inspired my ability to be able to do that. \n \nBob Marley because his music reached deep into my roots to re-aquaint me of my black heritage and struggles. \n \nJohnny Cash because like Marley, his music created a lot of social consciousness in me, plus when I was a kid and I was suffering from a lot of deep problems, listening to Johnny Cash's prison songs really helped me so I can learn about the meaning of redemption from living the low life.          \nThe answer above about J.S. Bach championing the equal temperament tuning is a really good one, but to confine my answer to modern times I would say Phil Spector. Better known as a producer, he was a musician first, so I think he still qualifies.  \n \nOver his career he produced songs and albums for some big pop acts such as The Ronnettes, Tina Turner, The Beatles Let It Be album, The Ramones, John Lennon, Leonard Cohen, and The Righteous Brothers. \n \nNot only was the sound he brought to these songs hugely influential, he is a source of some really wild stories of what takes place behind the scenes in the music industry.          \nBackstreet Boys \n \nThey influenced boy bands to give it a shot. One Direction could have been dumb if BSB didn't create this boy band madness. And their harmonization is excellent.          \nJustin Bieber and One Direction! <33333333 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665          \nI especially agree with Me2 and teandbikkies.  \nHowever there is one that is over looked. This is the one that brought the magical reverbarations of the electric base guitar into the souls of young people in the early 50's. Others had great acts and music, but Duane Eddy (Artistic Name) Whailed out with what was till then only a minor undeveloped instrument.          \nSome bands that have greatly influenced music: \n \n1. The Beatles \n2. Elvis \n3. Jimi Hendrix   \n4. Stevie Ray  \n5. Eric Clapton \n6. Queen \n6. Alice in Chains \n7. Pearl Jam                        \n8. Stone Temple Pilots \n9. Ray Charles \n10. Little Richard \n11. Bob Dylan \n12. The Rolling Stones \n13. Bob Marley \n14. Led Zepplin  \n15. Pink Floyd \netc.  \n \nSome of these artist were true pioneers and creators of Rock n Roll, Grunge, Reggae, etc. \nThese bands are LEGENDS forever their names written in gold. To all the clueless people: \nDaft Punk and One Direction are far from legends, never will be, and can't hold a candle to these artists. No offense, but such a comment is so off the mark it's laughable.  \n \nThese artists created music for the sake of music. Not a quick buck. They didn't pander to the music industries, or the population. They made music straight from the heart and soul. Passion, Aggression, Emotion, that is music.          \ndefintly michial jackson          ", "question": "\n    Suggested \"Question of the Day\" from the community: To most, music is important in your lives.

I apologized for getting so mad, (which I sorta regret now) and we moved past it.

So yeah they do have delays most of the time.          \nwell they used to be good but started to fall apart about 2 or 3 years ago..now their flights are always delayed..half the time they give ur seats to other people even though u paid it..nice people but so much organized..barely anyone goes on their airlines anymore(not even jamaicans)..u will see about 15-25 people in there...my advice is next time you take spirit..its way better and cheaper..          \ni think the only reason like someone said above me is that they try to make their flight safer and they dont trust me they dont let other peeps take ur seat only if u miss ur flight so dont worry cuz thats what im taking in this month air jamica to montego bay          \nAir Jamaica is the only airplane that is still giving free food. Other airlines like American Airlines make you pay. \r\n \r\n\u2606 Mixed Curly Fries \u2606 \r\n(\\__/)  \r\n(='.'=) \u2665 \r\n(\")_(\")          \nHavnt you ever heard of Jamaica time?  besides they are a great airline--you cant please everyone all the time.          \nThe service on Air Jamaica is really good, the only downfall is that they have flight delays all the time. They usually arent extremely late though.          \nMy wife is Jamaican and insists we used Air Jamaica the first few times we went.  (never had a crash yadayad  yada.)  So like other said they have had more and more delays.  Last time was the worst.  Call night before telling us the flight was cancalled and we had to take a diiferent flight. 2hrs earlier or 2 hrs later.   We took the ealier, whaich was the first flight our of JFK that day, then it was delayed an hour.  And had to stop in Montego Bay, when we were flying to Kingston. We get off the plan because they said we were switching plans, only to fine out we would get back on the same plan.  Only half full with half of those people in Air Jamiaca out fits sitting in the bussiness class and taking up almost all the overhead compartments.  On they way back it was the worst trip for me on a airline ever.  First it was delayed and hr, then another 1 and a half and finally yet another hr.  It was so bad that while sitting at the airport to leave we were losing time.  There was no weather issue or anything.  This was what should be our last trip on the airline.  we are flying Delta next week.          \nPersonally, I wouldn't fly Air Jamaica if they GAVE me a ticket.  We go to Jamaica at least once a year and tried to remain faithful to Air Jamaica.  However, after a work stoppage that resulted in our being stranded on the tarmac for hours, mechanical problems that resulted in a 2 day delay in our return, lost baggage and very poor customer service I have finally given up.  Never, no matter how extreme the situation has the airline offered so much as an apology (other than the flight crew).  No more for me.          \ncustoms has nothing to do with the airline. air jamaica is one of the best and safest airline but they are usually late. the pilots and the hostesses are extremely warm and friendly. u will enjoy travelling on that airline.          \nI just got back from Negril Jamaica and flew with Air Jamaica this is the first time I have ever experience something so scary in my LIFE. The plane landing gear did not come down to do the proper landing, so the plane circled  around Mo bay and Lucea unit the pilot got the heads up to land the plane.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121101120015AAD69XU", "answer": "\nDONT DO IT !! Any form of drug inside you whilst there is a baby is unnatural and CAN have effects on the baby!! Each baby is different, therefore differnt things would affect it's progression in uterus.          \nI think it's wrong and selfish to smoke ANYTHING while pregnant. Yes the tobacco in it might harm your baby so why take the risk? There are tons of other ways to have fun while pregnsnt then getting high and harming your baby.          \nMy mom said she smoked weed a few times during the 1st trimester with me.. \r\nI don't think it had any effect on me.  \r\nBut i wouldn't do it if I was pregnant.Just because.          \nIf you can't stop until after you have the baby, then you're pretty selfish and put yourself above your child. Any kind of drugs in your system is bad for the baby. \r\n \r\nDon't do it.          \nWell I think you just answered you own question. \r\n \r\nWhy would you smoke anything while pregnant?  I would not smoke cigarettes let alone a drug that hasn't been fully studied during pregnancy. \r\n \r\nAs a mother you should want to keep your baby as safe as possible.  So if that means you forgo something you like for 9 months to do all you can to protect your child like giving up all smoking, drinking etc then you should do it.          \nThere are no proven facts that the baby would be harmed by smoking weed. It's not suggested though. I'm pregnant & personally I quit as soon as I found out I was pregnant just because I don't want to take the chances of harming my baby.  \r\nThe main issue with smoking weed while pregnant, is most doctors offices make you pee in a cup at every appt. and they will see the THC in your system. If there is THC in your system upon the baby being born, the state would be notified and they will take your baby away. \r\nSo, NO I wouldn't do it, because I couldn't live with the fact that my child was taken away due to my stupid habits.          \nThere is not reason to keep smoking weed once a women finds out she's pregnant. And if she says it's because of morning sickness, well almost all pregnant women have morning sickness and deal with it. so why can't she. Pregnancy should be a very happy time no matter if she is sick or not. And she should do anything for the good health of her baby, whether she wants to or not, and I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to. If she can't handle what comes with pregnancy, then she isn't ready to be pregnant. Smoking weed while pregnant comes with nothing but excuses of why they are doing it. No real reason to continue smoking. If one can't not stop smoking for 9 months, then what about the next 18 years of being a mother. Weed is not addictive. therefore you can stop anytime you want. And I know that for a fact. also smoking weed while pregnant will result in low birth weight. I don't see how anyone would want to or need to feel high when pregnant, it should be a joyful time. Just think about it, would you smoke a joint with your kids? So, why smoke when they are inside of you.          \nIt's a proven fact that cannabis affects the unborn child causing low birth weight and development. This is because cannabis reduces the oxygen supply to the placenta. Your choice but please don't expect tax payers to support your special needs child caused by your actions.          \nWeed doesnt have tobacco in it first of all.... I use to smoke weed and with my first pregnancy i knew I was going to abort so I did I am now pregnant again and I would never dream of it.... \nAn old friend of mine smoked weed throughout both of her pregnancies.... and her kids are slow.... they could have been alot smarter but they dont stand a chance since she smoked weed. \n \n Not to mention that puts THC in your babies body and when the babies born they will be cranky due to going through withdrawls from no longer having the THC          \nIt's a disgrace to even concider it. Hell you want to give your baby the best chances of a good healty life so why the hell would you wana spoke weed. It will cause all sorts of problems. Stop being a selfish ***** and think of that life growing inside of you and give it a chance to have a healty life          \nWhy would you ask yahoo these idiots don&#x27;t know right from left you wanna get some real knowledge go and ask your doctor          ", "question": "\n    I'm not saying its wrong or right but I'd like to know people's views on smoking cannabis while pregnant.

I was about 10 weeks before I knew I was pregnant, I drank and smoked weed and cigarettes. \r\nAs long as you have stopped now, it will probobly be ok. Tell your doctor.          \nWell of course its bad for the baby. But its better to stop now then to not stop at all. The more u smoke the worse it can be for your baby.          \nWell as long as you stop now, you should be fine.  Don't worry too much, a lot of times it happens like that.  I found out I was pregnant and a week and a half before I found out, I was out with some friends and had a lot to drink.  I didn't know.  I told my doctor and he said it was fine, it was so early and it's not like I was drinking and getting drunk everyday.  Just make sure you stopped now, and talk to your doctor about it.  I am sure everything is fine. \r\n \r\nGood Luck:)          \nSTop smoking anything! .. PERIOD!          \nUnfortunately, it is bad for the baby. If you have stopped smoking completely, then that is exactly what you should be doing for the sake of your baby.          \nIt's not good for the baby, but you can't get in a time machine and change it now.  All you can do now is look forward and strive to make this a very healthy and safe pregnancy.  No more drugs.  Take a vitamin.  Stay fit.  Eat well.  Read some books.  Get ready.          \nI've heard that it doesn't cause birth defects besides low birth weight.The main concern with smoking anything is that it causes early miscarriage. but it depends on how much you smoked and how far along you are. best thing is to tell you dr. that you are a heavy smoker and he will monitor  your hcg and do an u/s to see if the pregnancy is progressing right.           \nrelax and take a chill pill...your baby is fine just stop smoking now...weed is a natural herb unless u been lacing it with something else...tell your doctor about this though so they can check for any abnormalities...but when i was pregnant with my daughter i was smoking and when i found out i was pregnant i was already 3 month along b/c my periods were always on and off...she is perfectly fine no harm done...again stop doing it now though. good luck.          \nsimple!!! Dont smoke it again while you are pregnant :)           \nStop now.  Your baby should be fine but you need to stay away from things like weed and alcohol and start taking care of yourself.          \ntell a doctor try and get ready, like take classes or medications to stop the addictions.          \nIt's horrible for the baby, but the best thing to do is stop now. There's nothing you can do about the past few weeks, so don't beat yourself up about it. Just do what you can at this point, which is stop smoking.          \nYou should not worry about what you did in the past.  Many mothers did similar things before they found out they were pregnant and there kids turned out just fine.  You did not know that you are pregnant and the past is the past.  Just be sure that you do not do it anymore as it is not good for the baby.  The 1st 3 months is very critical for the fetus.  And you should not do any weed or anything that can harm the baby for the remainder of the pregnancy and while you breastfeed.  Good luck and congratulations.          \nfirst of all, this is all messed up...smoking weed...illegal... \r\nmake sure you stop NOW. stop drinking and smoking. I knew someone who drank all their pregnancy. and the baby was deformed and they had to fly it to a hospital and it was horrible. the baby lived for a couple months but in pain . it had diseases of all sorts, was blind, and so on. the mom is screwed..i mean shes in major debt from all that and still drinking. but think if the baby had lived...it would have a horrible life all because of it's stupid mom.          \nGirl u be fine I smoke weed until I was 6 months pregnant and my baby is healthy smart and sexy... \r\n \r\nAnd my sister smoke weed that entired 9 months and her baby is smart and healthy \r\n \r\nU be fine don't worry.... \r\n \r\nHave a safe pregnancy          \nTo the girl who insulted VA, where the heck are u from? the Commonwealth is one of the richest, prettiest, and most conservative states out of the 50!!!!!  \r\n \r\n \r\nANYWAY....  smoking BAD!

There are just so many people trying to get enough money to feed their family and the ship is only there for a short time so they have to be aggressive.  Most times fares and prices are negotiated.  I have been on many cab rides in trade for a backpack. Don't judge Jamaica but that one limited experience.  It is a beautiful island and the people are warm and friendly. \"No charge to look\" is a common expression. \"Being a guide\" sometimes brings a tip.  They have huge competition and are just trying to make a living.  When the ship leaves the money goes with it.  You can't appreciate the beauty of Jamaica by getting off a ship for a short time.          \nWell I'm sorry to hear of your terrible experience in our country.  \r\nBut if you nah like Jamaica don't ever come back again!  \r\nYour scaring away the tourists here on yahoo who might want to go.          ", "question": "\n    Hi all \r\n \r\nFirst off, I hope this article doesn't put a dampener on anyone's holiday plans to Jamaica, this is just merely documenting my experience, and I welcome anyone to share their good/bad experience too. \r\n \r\nI was recently on a cruise and we stopped at Ocho Rios. We had been pre-warned that the sales technique in Jamaica was aggressive. As soon as I had got off the ship I was swarmed with cabbies insisting I take their cab to this and that and everywhere for very high rates. I had to battle my way through just to get to the security gate to the street! I thought it was very unfair as there were some people (elderly, disables etc..) who had to take a cab at those extortionate rates. Once I had reached the street, heading toward the downtown area, I was once again confronted by more than a dozen cabbies wanting me to use their cabs. After that I came to an area of people selling things behind a fence with special 'Tourist police' watching them. Later on I spoke to these tourist police and they told me they were there to protect tourists, and that the reason those particular sellers had to sell from behind the fence was because of their previous aggressive selling to tourists. I was offered everything from shells (which I could get from the beach) to quite decent souvenirs.  \r\n \r\nOnce I hit the downtown area I was shocked. Some of the streets looked worse than some slums in India and that unfortunately stereotypical smell of weed dominated the air. \r\n \r\nI quickly figured that the general rule of thumb in Jamaica was that if you touched something you HAD to buy it, so I was cautious to only LOOK at everything. Shop sellers came out and beckoned tourists into their stores shouting 'It's free to browse!' Free to browse? Are you kidding me? Of course it's free to browse! Who in the hell charges someone to LOOK at their shop? \r\n \r\nAfter taking a short walk through a near by botanic garden which lookd half-decent, I was confronted by a boy aged probably 16/17 who told me there was a cool tortoise sculpture I had to get a picture with. I told him thank-you I'll check it out. He insisted I followed him to it.

Being a U.S. citizen I guess that's a subject that I can't comment about. \r\n \r\nWe always used A.J. when we traveled there.  A few years ago they stopped flying from Boston therefore, to avoid changing planes in New York, we've been using U.S. Air.  That was really too bad because we enjoyed the airline so much.  Always on time and very friendly.  We were even upgraded to first class a few times which was very enjoyable.   \r\n \r\nIf their service is still as good as it was then, it certainly would be a great way to show the tourists some of the friendly, capable, fun-loving ways of your beautiful island.          \nI dont think Air Jamaica should be shut down. I would rather Air Jamaica to have its own identity because its the national carrier of Jamaica. If the management of Air Jamaica  have no other choices, I do think they should merge with other airlines in the caribbean such as Caribbean Airlines and Cayman Airways and become one major caribbean airline. \r\n \r\nAnother method is that Air Jamaica can become a low-cost no frills airline. The cheaper the airfare the most likely people would travel. They can cut out  meal services to save money but still give complementary beverages. I travel to Jamaica 3 to 4 times a year from NY because of Spirit Airlines low fares. I bypass Air Jamaica because I simply cannot afford them even though Air Jamaica is still my first choice.          \nI do not think Air Ja shoudl close down because of the simple fact that it is the best airline to the Carribean.It is the best that we have. When I fly Air Jamaica I feel at home and treated good. Taxpayers pay for a lot of bullsh**t so why not air Jamaica. That is the national airline of Jamaica that would not be good for the country.          \nWell if a me a pay fah and from me born me neva go pon plane yet dem fi shut it dung. \r\n \r\nlol \r\n \r\nEconomically I think it is a waste, the only excuse to not shutting it down would be to restructure it's management and operations totally and see whether any good profit may be made.          \nNo, What they should do is try to make the airline better and stop messing up everything.          \nI dont think so but the last time I flew I had to take American Airlines b/c Air Jamaica was charging almost double the fare. They need to find a way to subsidize the fare and also a way to make profit.          \nNo they shouldn't close it down but try and find a rich investor or company willing to buy a very large portion (say 80%) and keep the name and routes.          \ni believe AJ is starting the process of trying to sell the airline to private investors.  the PM was speaking about it during his resent trip to the UK.          \nNOPE, not all atall. \r\nI perfer flying Air Jamaica, and almost only fly AirJ exclusively.

I would suggest a mediator like a therapist to learn good communication that works for both of you. This is a totally normal issue for couples and trust me therapy will help in the long run rather than fighting like this for the next 10 years and damaging the relationship.          \nyou are in an abusive marriage. your husband is abusing you. check with a local woman's shelter about what to do with domestic violence. domestic violence is not just hitting. it is the other stuff you mentioned. good luck.          \nDoesn't sound like communication is the problem.

He's telling you that he doesn't respect you. \r\n \r\n\"he just snaps into this total jerk, that completely loses his temper, he mocks me, he screams and cusses at me, he is very vendictive, and completley unreasonable\" \r\n \r\nYou're married to a boy -- not a man. \r\n \r\nGo get counseling.  If he won't go, then you go by yourself.  This is gross immaturity.  You need to try to bring the level up yourself -- and maybe you can.  If that doesn't work then I think you need to set some limits on what you're willing to accept.  You don't have to accept this kind of behavior. \r\n \r\nYou're married to a boy.  Your \"man\" needs to grow up and maybe you can help make that happen.  Get counseling.  Go by yourself if he won't go. \r\n \r\nGood luck.          \nThere is no way you should have allowed this behavior from him.  You need to put your foot down or he'll walk all over you.  Men will do anything for a woman, and you hold your rights! \r\nFirst, if this ever happens again, you FIRMLY say,  \r\n\"You, listen to me (with a very determined and raised and LOUD voice)..you are either going to listen to me or there will be no more communication from both of us until then.  If he chooses not to, then you DO NOT talk to him until he talks to you to resolve the issue.  If you give in, you're an ***.  Then in a a very CALM voice, you let him know what it is you don't like. \r\nUnder no circumstances are you to get angry or cry but stay calm and IN CONTROL.          \nwow! has your hubby always been this way...most of the time when a relationship starts you know when you fight that person will always be like that, the way they were the first time...if you are having problems communicating you feelings with him you should let him know.  Have you told him that it is hard for you to talk with hime w/out being scared that he is going to blow up on you?  Men cannot read minds...if you have told him this and he still becomes angry then mabey you should get out a pen and write down all the issues you have so when you confront him, they are infront of you...if that dosent work i would try and seek some counsuling...other people that ca watch your guys' behavior...can also show you other effective communication tools that you might be able to apply to your marriage..i wouldnt give up....          \nI think you need to explain to him the seriousness of the situation.  You need to let him know you expect him to hear you out, whether he agrees or not with what you are saying, and assure him he will have his chance to speak.  He is denying the fact that there is a problem, instead of accepting and trying to work out the whatever the issues at hand are.  Tell him that if you both don't work things out, that soon one of issues are going to be so out of hand that there will be no chance for repair.  He also sounds like he is an abusive partner.  It is not your fault that this happens, it is his. \r\n \r\nIn your situation, I'm leaning towards you might want to seperate from him for awhile so he understand how serious you are about this.  I went through this for quite a while myself, and I got to the point I no longer cared about the relationship or person.  Sometimes it's the only thing you can do to get your point across.          \nTry listening carefully to what he is saying.  More often than not, the things he complains about most are what he sees as his own shortcomings.  And remember, nothing is so sensitive for a man as his ego - his image of himself as a man / lover / husband.  What you offer as a topic for discussion, he may interpret as criticism of him. Try focusing your comments in a way that enables him to respond as comforting, guiding you.          \nwhy stay..look, i know it's only been 1 year but why stay...you two should still feel like newly weds...was he like this prior to you two getting married? Tell him what you told us, don't make it long, get to the point. Don't throw accusations, he'll only explode, you want to make him understand and know that the lack of communication is hurting you and the marriage, if he response in a hateful way...tell him that you want separation.          \nThere is never a good reason to stay with someone that treats you badly.  You need to not accept this. \r\n \r\nThis talking stuff does not work for him in even a little bit and in a very big way.  If he has this visceral of a reaction he has serious insecurity issues and your emotional need to have these resolution talks is a very bad match for his issues.  You can try some therapy, but only if you can find a way to stop the abuse. \r\n \r\nGood luck.          \nwow sounds like my bf. I'm not married but we live together... i feel the issue is important and needs to be discussed and he jumps up and down like a monkey. its like this Hun i say either we work on this as a team or you f.u.c.k. off out my life so i can find a man who will treat me right and who acts like a man and not a cave dwelling ape. you may not realize this but what he does is abuse. he is verbally abusing you and how can you respect him if he degrades you. write down your feeling on paper i mean really dig deep & tell him how you feel what you want and so forth then just leave it where he will find it and read it or even give it to him to read...tell him if he dont read it then   tell him its over. as humans we have to teach others how to treat us... if they are not willing to comply then they dont care about you or respect you. ask him if he want it to work...if he say yes then say \"well then we have to work as a team and stop working against each other or we wont last\",  because im so sick of being shutdown and not being able to talk to my partner about things that get to me.          \nIn my opinion communication is the hardest thing. There is a book called fighting for your marriage. There is an excellent communication technique illustrated in this book. With most couples there is a with drawer and a pursuer. You sound like the pursuer and he sounds like the with drawer. I used to be one. Like a drunk driver trying to see through 4 cups. People have filters when we try to listen. Sometimes we hear something different then what was said or intended. Try to paraphrase to understand better. Never place blame on one or the other, this causes men to think we have done something wrong. Most men think these old issues were solved already because they went away and everything seemed fine to them. We don't understand. Take slow steps using the paraphrase technique and you might understand each other a little better. Good luck.

Contact your doctor for an accurate answer since you're early in your pregnancy but overall, don't use any substance during your pregnancy - 1st trimester or last - makes no sense          \nas wrong as what you did is, i'm not gonna judge.  i'm sure you're baby will be ok as long as you stop that kind of behavior from here out.  don't worry.  and talk to your doctor if you're uncomfortable about it.  good luck!          \nSo you justify the fact that you smoked weed during pregnancy because you have anxiety? You were worried your anxiety would harm your baby, but you thought smoking weed would be better for it? If that's the case, you're really not fit to be a parent. You should be worried, your child may be born with physical or mental birth defects. Pregnancy is a long, tough journey and if your \"anxiety\" is too bad to deal with that, to the point where you feel you'll need weed to deal with it, I would suggest re-examining your choice to be a parent.          \nDon't worry so much.  I have a 2 month old and I had no idea I was pregnant until I was 8 weeks.  I got drunk the 2 weekends before I found out, smoked weed everyday, and as much as I hate to admit it, I did ecstacy pills both weekends I drank.  I had no clue I was pregnant, once I found out, I stopped everything and my lil man is just fine.  Matter of fact being that he is 2 months old, he is ahead of most other kids his age.  Don't stress so much because added stress can make your pregnancy difficult.  I worried my WHOLE pregnancy about those 2 weekends and everything came out fine.  Just stop what you have been doing.

First of all, what's done is done and worrying about it could only stress you and have a bad effect on the baby.

I remember sitting in the doctor's office and going : \"I drank a redbull, took my medicine for migraines, drank 2 beers,...\" She had to interrupt me and say \"Don't worry, everything is going to be fine.\" My baby is now born and she is perrrfect. \r\nAnd believe me, those pills I take for my migraines must be way worst then a little weed. Research Melanie Dreher (google her name) and it may reassure you, as well.  \r\nAs long as you stop from now on, everything should be perfectly fine. Now that you know it don't risk it. But don't worry about the past.

Good for Johnson and Lee.          \nWest Indies lost a golden opportunity to put Australia under pressure by their inept batting.  Australia were in total mess yesterday when 5 wickets fell in succession.  However Symonds and Haldin saved them from total collapse.  Today when West Indies were in control of the game till time time, Johnson who had an ordinary match till then, came out strongly after tea and gained the lead for Australia.  That is the reason why Australia is a strong team as they have players in their rank who can turn the game any time.          \nIn my views if the West Indians bats to their full potential they can win this one. They have a good team but no consistence. The Australians are a tough team to beat, however they are not playing as well as they did a year ago before they lost their main 3 players. West Indies can win this one but they have to bat with patience instead of too much fire power. Batting like my fellow Guyanese Chanders can obtain them a win. They can do it, they have the potential and all they have to do is use it.          \nAs DJ Lillee said: \"once in a lifetime  prospect ...\".

In the start he gave like 9 or 10 runs per over but the way he came back was superrrrrrrrrrrr  He helped the team when they really needed it. \r\nWest Indies was looking good . But hands off to Johnson.  \r\nTo be honest I had not expected that, he was really struggling but good to see that he didn't give up.  \r\nI hope that the Aussies bat well. Bowlers alone can't help the team win the match. I hate to see Brett lee scoring runs more than good batsman.

Drinking will,but you stopped doing it when you found out you were pregnant,as did I,and that won't hurt anything, you found out,stopped drinking,and thats the end of that.

No,so theres nothing to fear there,I know some women that have found out they're pregnant and still smoked,their kids are fine,I don't look down upon it,it's your choice,and it will not harm the fetus.          \nIsn't weed illegal          \nWhile I'm not supporting her habits - she asked WHAT COULD HAPPEN  to the fetus  because of this; she did NOT ask for your opinion of her mothering skills.

It seems like that's cutting it pretty close, considering it takes a while for people to leave the plane, and I'd then have to find my terminal, and they begin to board 30 minutes before take off. Any info? Thanks.  ", "title": "\n    Washington DC Airport Question?  "},

[Logan, Boston??]- Matters, because time and distance influence what you take as carry-on.  The longer the flight, the more stuff.  (food*, self-entertainment,,,, *but drinks cannot be from the \"outside\" - you must buy after you pass security. \n \ninformation needed: flight #, etc.  {some people print their ticket out at home, others at the airport computer kiosks.}  Personal ID is a drivers license, state ID card (for minors), and /or a birth certificate or passport.  [ Look on line for specifics. ] \n \nYou will get a meal on a long flight, but bringing your own snacks can help relieve the boredom. \n \nArrive a couple hours early; go through security, find your gate, then go in search of restrooms, food, etc. \n \nMy guess is the bag fee is each way.  The website might tell you for sure ( or confuse you - lol. } \n \nMy wife swears by EARPLANES (a specially designed ear plug) for combating take-off and landing air pressure variances.  {They are typically only good for a max of 1 landing, 1 take-off, so you might need 2 or 3 pair.}          \nLGB is Long Beach, California \nYou should arrive at least 90 minutes before departure. \nIf you check a bag, the fee is per person, per bag and each way so if you check one bag for the round trip, it would cost 70.  \nYou will need your driver's license or state id and the credit card you used to buy the ticket.  You probably won't need to show the credit card but it's good to have it.   \nWhen you arrive at the airport, go to the Delta ticket counter and you can check in at the kiosk.  You will then pay for the checked bag fee and drop the bag off with the gate agent.   \nThe main thing with carry on is you can only have 1 bag that goes in the overhead bin and a small bag or purse that must go under the seat in front of you.   \nTake a look at the sites below for details on what you can and can't bring.   \nIf you are checking a bag, put all of your liquids and toiletries in the checked bag.  That will save a lot of trouble with your carry on.   \nWhen you get to the security check point, just watch what everyone else is doing.  Take your shoes off and if you have a jacket or sweater, you'll have to take that off too.  \nThe air pressure in the plane is regulated pretty well so you should be okay.  You can always get some ear plugs that would help          \nI fly all the time, and Delta Airlines is probably the best domestic airline in my experience.  \n \nNormally, arriving at the airport one hour before your flight is enough time, but if you're not used to flying or going through airports, I'd arrive at the airport at least an hour and a half before your flight leaves. The $35 fee to check your bag is for each bag you check, each way.   So if you check one bag going to California and one bag going home to Salt Lake City, it will cost you $70 total.  You can check your bag when you check in at the airport for your flight, and then you pick it up when you arrive at your destination (just follow the signs that say \"baggage claim\" when you get off the plane; and they'll probably either make an announcement or will have TV monitors telling you exactly where to claim your checked bag).  There will also be Delta employees at the airport who you can ask where to go if you need more information.  \n \nAs far as bringing liquids on the plane:  You can bring as much as you want in your checked bag - just make sure they're well packed so the containers don't break or leak.  Liquids that you bring in your carry-on bags must be in 100ml (a little over 3 ounce) containers, and must all fit in a one-quart Ziploc bag.  They'll have more specific information on exactly what you can bring in your carry-on bags on the Delta Airlines website but basically, no knives/scissors/weapons and no liquids in larger containers.  \n \nAs far as air pressure hurting your ears:  I've never had this problem before, and I fly all the time.

Its supposed to benefit all Malays but so far only for the rich Malays gain somethings which is like 3%. \r\nIf you read your history textbooks, its says this is why Singapore seperate from Malaysia but Discovery Channel says that our dear 1st Prime Minister just kick them out...(haha our textbooks are wrong) \r\n \r\nEven though the Orang Asli are the real natives...(the most abused people in Malaysia in my opinion) even the textbooks won't exactly tell you that the Orang Asli are the 1st people here.          \nin malaysia , we have a special malay right ,nobody can question their right , it is a sensitive issue          \nWhile the Chinese were living in towns and own shoplots, the Malays were still in rural areas without electricity or water. Therefore the Malays were given special rights so that they could catch up with the Chinese and have at least 30% of the economic pie. \r\n \r\nSadly the history textbook omits the percentage of economy in British's hands. \r\n \r\nAdded: \r\nWhile the NEP objectives may have been achieved, its achievements will be kept secret so that 'orang-orang tertentu' can have more. In the meantime, some Malays were kept poor (and stupid, I mean remain 'hulu') so that NEP can be potrayed as still not achieved (while potraying the rich Chinese) thus NEP or whatever policy that favors Bumiputra must continue to stay.          \nBecause the Malays are afraid that the Chinese and Indians may over rule them, take over the country.          \n,,,, you must ask the similar question in yahoo singapore section,,,, \r\n \r\nWhy the Singaporean Malay and Indians don't receive the rights the Chinese receive? \r\n \r\n,,, hehe,,,          \nthe same reason why there 4 juta unregister voters in Malaysia \r\nthat mean if u met a non malay that is more than 40 yrs old , he likely to  \r\ntell u he do not care and never vote once yet.........lol \r\nimagined a state like Johor having less than 1000 non malay civil servant \r\nwt the internet register for voter on , the malay r asking for problem          \nveritas is right .... everyone worked hard for Independence, not only the Malays ... but they are so selfish by turning the tables and calling the non-malays 'pendatang' now ..do u think they could have got their independence alone during British time....they cant even speak proper English now imagine how they spoke then with the British ??? Educated teachers from India and China came to Malaysia where they conversed in english with the British ...  \r\nIf there really is a 1Malaysia concept they would declare Good Friday/Easter/Vasaki/Chap Goh Meh as a Public Holiday.... the true malays here are the orang asli .. the malays you see now are all mixed breed...if you check their history they all come from Indonesia...married chinese and indians in malaysia and that's what you see on the roads now ...  \r\nJust pray for our Country..that's all I can say          \nThis is simply because the Malays are in general not as smart as the Chinese and the Indians. If they were to be on the same footing as these two races, they simply can't survive. That's why the government have been helping them by giving them special rights and privileges all the past decades. It's sad to say they still can't perform despite all the help given. No offense.          \nWith a rational and practical understanding, please read my analogy: \r\n \r\nA civilization 'Z' began in the year 2000BC on a huge and fertile land, with the founding of large cities, organized and centralized governance, and a unifying culture, language, and tradition among its citizens. So advanced was civilization Z during its golden age, that it was common knowledge among its people that they were their empire was the centre of the world, much like america today presumes its sole-superpower status. Assume civilization Z continued its outstanding and persistant administration and knowledge-based civilian heritage for 4000 years, and what sort of society would you get? \r\n \r\nA civilization 'B' started in the year 4000BC on a large tropical continent with great rivers, with the establishment of one of the first well-planned urban communities in the world, and having rulers who give priority to science, technology and education. Civilization B may not be as unified as civilization Z culturally and linguistically or even politically, but it is because of this diversity that every society in that civilization compete with each other through war and trade. Constant contact with the other nations made it the centre of trade, and the sheer wealth of the nation made it attractive to more advanced empires. Furthermore, not only is the civilization entrepreneurial and scientific, it is also spiritual. So much so that a few of the largest religions of the world originated from it. Assume this civilization molds its people in its economic, scientific, and religious nature for 6000 years, and what kind of community would be created in its 6000th year? \r\n \r\nA civilization 'N' began to exist circa 200AD on a divided homeland of islands filled with thick jungles and rocky rivers. Having safety from foreign invasions because of its geographical division, each island (and in fact each valley) matured independently and left to its own devices. Only two ancient native kingdoms managed to unite the peoples of the islands, and they only existed briefly. Without political unity, it would be hard to concentrate effort on anything, namely scientific and common adoption of traditions among the people of N. However, assume one good thing about civilization N is that it is strategic. Anyone in civilization Z who wants to go to civilization B must go through civilization N. Having this position civilization N develops a pretty much tolerant, welcoming, and open-minded view of the peoples of the world. So people of N intermarry with people of the west, east, and among people from the other islands and valleys. After centuries of exposure and tolerance, civilization N welcomes everyone to live in it, creating a vibrant and colourful society. But since people from Z and B are more advanced and have an older (therefore more experienced) tradition than civilization N, people of N are at a disadvantaged when competing with them. \r\n \r\nAssume alotting a perfectly equal reasources to a person of Z, B, and N cultures. Each of them instictively know what to do, but since a person thinks and acts according to his mold, wouldn't the result be at varying degrees of success? Shouldn't the resources then be alotted justly, rather than equally, since Z, B, and N know and understand each others' background and how each of them came to their current predicament?

I see alot of potential for you b/c you have alot of interpersonal perspective - you know alot about yourself and your feelings.  Many people do not have that, and some are downright reptilian - no feeling, no emotion.   \r\n   \r\nYou may need to see a doctor.  That is the best way.  I knew and still know people with the same anger issues, and they feel terrible.  Medication helps, but weed does not.  I know the feelings of depression - many people have them.  Many who do not go through this will not understand - you have to be forgiving of that.  But many people know what you are going through.   \r\n \r\nI personally know many bad things happened to me, and I have been considered one of the nicest people anyone knows.  I still feel I get verbally stabbed in the back by people I know b/c they may not be happy with themselves, and for some reason see me as being on the \"grass is greener\" side - which is not true.   \r\n \r\nMy bad luck cycles for a few years, then is good for a few years.  In one cycle of the \"bad luck years\" I remember working many jobs at once, family members (gradparent) dying, pets dying, tortourous things in the hospital (made her worse for a period of 2 agonizing years - she smoked all her life - the meds and procedures caused her to erase the last 20 years of my life from her brain) happening to my grandparent before she died, not having money, issues with people in my immediate family and their lifestyle (alcohol, etc), fights, etc.   \r\nDon't feel bad if this real story of bad luck makes you feel a little better - it just lets you know that you are not alone - b/c no one wants to feel alone. And that is why I wrote this.   \r\nFind a doctor if you cannot take it.  Believe me, you will realize your potential in life.    Bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people, and vice-versa.  Personally, it gives me more faith in God.  For some people, it does the reverse.          \nI know dude life his hard for everyone. You need to stay positive and focus on college and getting a career and being successful and being happy.

But the final decision, is for you to decide, you have to weigh every possibilities of it. Good luck..          \nTell him nicely to go to rehab          \n*facepalm* \r\n \r\nI want to you go back and read everything you just wrote, and pretend it was your daughter that wrote it. What would you tell her to do? Wouldn't you want better for her life? Wouldn't you tell her she was being stupid and naive and that she needs to get some self esteem and quit living in fairy tale land that somehow everything is going to end up ok? Because it's not. You're insane if you think this is what a normal healthy relationship is. You're insane if you think this kind of lifestyle is better for a child than a life with no father in it. You need to grow up, get some self esteem, and focus on your child instead of this immature little boy of a boyfriend. You can't change him! Period. If he wanted to change, he would have done it by now. You aren't going to fix him. Your love for him is NOT enough.  \r\n \r\nYour number one priority should be on how to raise your child with dignity and self respect, and the role modeling you're providing her by staying and putting up with this and exposing her to this kind of lifestyle is far from being a responsible parent. You need a serious reality check little girl.          \nWatch enough staring Jennifer Lopez and take it from there          ", "question": "\n    I met my boyfriend when I was 15 (he was 18)...he was my pot dealer. at the time he was also dealing worse stuff  \r\nand I knew he was also stealing cars with his homies and other stuff...at the time I didn't mind at all. I mean he was just my pot dealer after all. Then after a while we started dating and I totally fell for him...he was like the best boyfriend a girl could dream. If I wanted anything even very expensive I just had to ask him and after a while he would get it for me. He told me he loved me and that I was special girl everyday. He gave me pot for free but didnt let me touch other drugs. He made sure I stayed out of trouble. The only things that bothered me is that he didn't want to tell me the details of what he was doing and he lied to me a lot. Also when he got mad at me he was really scary It wouldnt have surprised me at all if he had started beating me but he never did he just hit himself or started hitting stuff...but he didnt get mad often like most of the time he was really a cool headed kinda guy and I soon learnt not to piss him of.  \r\nThen when I was 16 I got pregnant and my mother kicked me out of the house. I was scared of his reaction but to my surprise he was really excited to become a father he was really happy. I went to live in his appartment and for a while life was real good. He promised me he would find an honest job and be a good father and I believed him but he didnt. He doesnt seem to care for our daughter at all he says he loves her but barely talks to her.He buys toys for her but thats it he never plays with her and barely show her any affection. He says he love me but expect me to basically do everything in the house for him and doesnt help me at all. He doesnt want me to find a job or have friends. He disappear for days sometimes weeks and when he comes back hes either full of money or wants us to change appartment/city/neighboorod. I think Ive lived in 20 different places so far.  \r\nAnd now I think he mustve pissed of the wrong people or done something really horrible like a murder. He's not himself anymore. We had to change appartment again and he doesnt let me out anymore he says that its too dangerous. He sleeps all day and only go out at night. He has panic attacks despite all the pain killer he take and the weed he smokes and seem really terrified all the time like hes going to get killed soon. \r\nAnd now Im scared really scared. Scared of whats going to happen to him (he doesnt what to tell what he has done) and scared for me&my daughter. I dont want my daughter to grow up living such a life but I dont want to be a single mom I dont want to grow up with no father like I did. And I dont know where I could go what could I do. I cant go back to my mom. I dont have any friends. I havent worked since I was in high school. I have no skills. And I dont want to abandon ''Kyle'' first because I still love him second because Im afraid of what hes going to do to me if I do. And I feel like we are really kindred soul I mean we are really similar at heart. I grew up without a father with my mother abusing me and he grow up with a step father who beat for no reason almost everyday and a mother who was either to stoned or drunk to properly take care of her children. He had to basically raise his brother at age 6 he changed his diaper fed him etc. Then when he was 14 he ended up in juvie for a year and when he was out his parents didnt want him anymore so he was basically kicked out. \r\nI feel that he really is a good person at heart he just never had a chance. \r\nSo what should I do? I know that this horrible situation is my own fault but please for the sake of a child (my little girl) dont just start insulting me be helpful \r\ndo you think theres anyway I could change him? And what do you think he has done? \r\nWhat should I do? I dont wanna leave him but things cant go on like that  ", "title": "\n    My boyfriend is a criminal and I don't know what to do?

Whites and non locals a warned not to venture out from the holiday complexes in jamaica.          \n80% safe          \nTake this answer into consideration from a real Jamaican, who lives in Jamaica...It depends on the area you want to go to , for example the North Coast is safer than in the south coast... Remember though that not every where in the universe is 100% safe. You do not need to carry a weapon, just do not loiter or idle on the streets around that's all unless you are in a large group. \r\nHope this Helps!!!          \nGet a guide, don't go yourself. Driving there is crazy and some of the rural roads are a disaster if you don't know them.  \r\n \r\nPlus a guide is always good if you find someone your cool with and trust.

If you plan on exploring the Blue Mountain range I would recommend more than just a regular road map but rather a topographical map. You can get topographical maps at the National Land Agency. You would need a sheet 13 or 18, don't quite remember which. I would further recommend that you not try to explore the Blue Mountains on you own but rather get a tour guide.  Also note that if you want to get to the peak you will have to do some hiking in rough terrain so be prepared for that- good hiking boots, water, snacks etc.  \r\n \r\nDriving in Jamaica is a bit tricky. Road users don't necessary follow all the rules of the road esp. indicating be prepared for that. The roads can also be a bit narrow and winding. There is a Black River safari that you can try. You will go with a tour guide and get a guided tour of quite a bit of the river. Be sure to go down to Little Ochi for fish afterwards! \r\n \r\nIf you want to a good view of Jamaica also visit some attraction in the east e.g. Raft on the Rio Grande in Portland, visit Somerset falls and be sure to go by Boston in Portland for some jerk.  \r\n \r\nFamiliarize yourself with our local currency and the exchange rate to prevent being excessively charge along the way. The truth is by yourself, with a none Jamaican accent, in areas that tourists don't tradionally go, it may just happen.  \r\n \r\nAnd don't be scared it is pretty safe. Stay away from Spanish Town, the garrisons of Kingston and any other area as stated by your embassy. You will be safe and do have fun!

Big dogs need space, and apartments aren't the best for them.          \nMy grandfather had one and it was great. They are in my opinion the best dogs when it comes to children. Now i do not know much about them but i can tell you that they do grow to be quite large. Between 130-150 pounds for a male, a little lighter for the females. So that's something to think about depending on the size of your apt. Also i think that it is great that you have a lake near. My grandfather lives next to an enormous lake, and his newfoundland loved to swim. After all that is what they were born to do. I have looked up some info for you also. The dogs droopy lips and jowls makes the dog drool. The Newfoundland dog is legendarily known for its benevolence and strength. It is known to be one of the kindest and gentlest dogs, if not the very best and gentlest dog of all when it comes to children. They have deep barks, are easy to train, are fine guardians and watchdogs, and are extremely good with children. There are several health problems associated with Newfoundlands. Newfoundlands are prone to hip dyspepsia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint), Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder). Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis, also referred to as subaortic stenosis or SAS. This is a common heart defect in Newfoundlands involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. Other than the size issue believe you have chosen a great dog. i hope this info helps you in your decisions.          \nYes they can live in an apartment if taken out regularly,as they are general quite a laid back dog.Yes they are really good with kids they are one of the best dogs with kids i know.Grooming,is probably their only down side in my opinion they shed a lot and have a very long thick coat.Vet fees will depend on the dog and how it was bred. \r\nThe lake idea is very good,they love the water and are still used in many parts of the world as water rescue dogs and sometimes companions for fishermen. \r\nYes there is something else you should know they may overheat in summer and loose jowls may lead to saliva control problems.          \nnewfs are great dogs... be prepared for hair and drool and expect the dog to lay right in the middle of the hallway or right infront of the sink.  we have two large hairy dogs and they are overwhelmng at times (we have 18 acres).  altho they may say these dogs are suited for apt life, i would doubt it. \r\nand grooming?  with a large hair dog, expect to spend 1/2 hour a day grooming...  be prepared! \r\n:)          \ni can tell you from my experience my opinion, my newfie is 7 months old and 95 lbs.  i think a newfoundland is a special breed (i have owned many breeds over the years) he is very gentle great with my grand children (2 years and younger). if you can brush him every day that will cut down on alot of any shedding and keep the coat beautiful plus it doesn't take long to brush him if u keep up with it.   \r\n a good quality food is best for them because they grow so fast.  my pup is on a grain free food because of allergies.  \r\n i think they can adapt to any size house or apartment as long as they can get a daily walk. \r\n if you get you newfie from a good breeder you vet fees shouldn't be much more than any other dog.  take your time and look for a very good breeder or else it will cost ALOT at the vet.   \r\n my pup was so easy to train !  with treats in hand they give you there full attention and listen very well. eager to please you !  \r\n you will need heavy duty toys (kong) the cheaper toys don't last more than a couple of hrs.  \r\n  as i mentioned this breed is unlike other breeds you will fall in LOVE with a newfie. \r\n i hope this helped and if you decide on getting one i wish you the best of luck.          \nThe Newfoundland is a wonderful addition to a family that can deal with hair, slobber, and hugeness and is willing and able to teach the dog good manners before it weighs 100 or more pounds. \r\n \r\nAfter your dog has less energy and your dog might feel hungry as well. That is the best time to train your dog as he is willing to do anything you ask in order to get the food treat. \r\n \r\nBecause of the size of this animal, I would recommend to get this dog only you have a landed house that has at least a small yard. They are ok with apartment, but without freedom to walk around, they will be bored. \r\n \r\nNewfoundland Dog is sweet and gentle, and good with children. They are also courageous and intelligent which make them the dogs that are eager to save people in the water.  \r\n \r\nWhen rearing puppies give them soft food, such as well-boiled rice and milk, as soon as they will lap, and, shortly afterwards, scraped lean meat. Newfoundland puppies require plenty of meat to induce proper growth. The puppies should increase in weight at the rate of 3 lbs. a week, and this necessitates plenty of flesh, bone and muscle-forming food, plenty of meat, both raw and cooked. \r\n \r\nMilk is also good, but it requires to be strengthened with casein. The secret of growing full-sized dogs with plenty of bone and substance is to get a good start from birth, good feeding, warm, dry quarters, and freedom for the puppies to move about and exercise themselves as they wish. Forced exercise may make them go wrong on their legs. \r\n \r\nMedicine should not be required except for worms, and the puppies should be physicked for these soon after they are weaned, and again when three or four months old, or before that if they are not thriving. If free from worms, Newfoundland puppies will be found quite hardy, and, under proper conditions of food and quarters, they are easy to rear.

The hotel features a really nice outdoor balcony that I enjoyed sitting on and watching the sun rise and set over the ocean. \r\n \r\nJust remember: Make sure you're aware of your surroundings at all times, just like you would be in your hometown, and enjoy yourself! \r\n \r\nSafe travels!          \nI've been to Jamaica 6 times (Ochos Rios, Mobay, Negril and Falmouth) and felt safe each trip. Although I never travelled alone I have left the resorts by myself and no problems.  \r\nAs with anywhere you go be sure to be aware of your surroundings and keep your guard up. You will be asked to purchase things as well as ganja but a simple no thank you will let them know you're not interested.  \r\nI think Jamaica gets a bad rap, it isn't fair. Every state, city, country has a good part and a bad part.           \nI would advise you not to travel outside of the tourist area and only stay in crowded areas like plazas and restaurants. A friend of mine and his brother who visited Jamaica was jumped when he tried to go into town where the locals frequent. A couple I know said they were repeatedly approached and ask if they wanted to buy pot when they got off the cruise ship.   \r\n \r\nNO, do not go on the beach at night. We were advised of this by the Bahamian police when we were on Grand Bahama island and I'm sure Jamaica is no better. It's a great place to be mugged. It's dark and it's hard to yell for help.           \nI have been to JA 4 times this year by myself...  my first time, I got the same reaction from people I told.  My trips have been great!  I do have friends that live down there and spend a lot of time with them but there were times I went to the beach or in town by myself and had no problems.  As in anywhere you are - be aware of your surroundings.  There are plenty of places any where you go that can be dangerous,  I got a JA cell phone number through Digicel and had my cell phone unlocked through TMobile so I could use my phone while I was down there.  Everyone had my number and could call and check on me when ever they wanted and I could do the same.  Enjoy your trip - just keep reassuring everyone and things will be fine.  Good luck.          ", "question": "\n    Ok, so I've asked a similar question, but mostly on what to do there near Negril.   \r\nSince I've announced my plans to friends and family, I'v heard nothing but negativity about it.  One friend of my mother's, who travels frequently, went so far as to say \"you couldn't PAY me to go back to that country\", saying they were assaulted when they refused to buy drugs.  She practically begged me not to go by myself, saying she'd worry for my life.  I mean, geez, I know there's crime in the world, and I know it's in Jamaica.  ...But, is it really THAT bad?  I just want a quiet, relaxing, beach getaway, to think, write, and enjoy the beauty that is there. \r\nI was told not to go out after dark as well.  Is that good advice?  I mean, not go out at all after dark?  Even to sit on the beach?   \r\nIt's disheartening to think that one of the most beautiful places in the world could be thought of so poorly. \r\nSo...is it safe?  Should I do it alone, or wait til someone can join me?  What about walking around the country roads..can I do it?  Can I walk to a restaurant or something 5 or so miles away alone and not have a problem? \r\nI'm not completely naive, but I do like to find the best in people.  My mother worries I will befriend just about anyone, which is mostly true, but she says I shouldn't trust anyone if I even go at all.  How paranoid is that, or is there some truth to it?

Then you can decide whether you need to take up a job or not. Travel and room-rent is a major expense abroad, so if that is taken care, I think you are well off. \nA lot depends on your lifestyle also. If you shop / party / gift a lot, or eat at expensive restaurants, obviously you need the money to pay for those. \nI would say that one dollar is roughly equal to ten rupees. I know that the exchange rate is closer to 1:60, but that is only when you convert the currencies. If you are going to spend there it is closer to 1:10. So your $125 translates to roughly Rs. 1250. If you can manage with that, you don't need a job.          \nI think,the amount of weekly pocket money parents are giving to children has increased by 8.7pc.          \nWhether that's enough money or not, I doubt you will be able to find part time work as a non-citizen and teenager.          \nAs an exchange student you cannot legally work in the USA. \n \nAt that age my daughter was given an allowance of $20 a week and she managed on that.          \nyou need to be careful on what type of visa you are granted to be able to work in the US  \nit all depends on which state you are going to live in, some states are cheaper or expensive than others.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090412062107AAzPsKS", "answer": "\nYou're absolutely right.. and most teachers will agree with everything you say.  NCLB is an example of government interferance that - like almost always - turns out to be a very BAD thing. \r\n \r\nTo change it, they have to change the current law.   Parents (and teachers) need to be much more vocal about how this is damaging their kids.          \nAgreed.  There is too much political correctness and not enough Reading writing Arithmetic and Geography. \r\nThis is the problem. \r\nTeachers hands are tied from the mandates from the government requirements.  Government has decided that the  slow and the talented students will be taught together and this only slows all of them.  The program is over the heads of the slow children and the program is too boring for the talented student.   \r\n \r\nThis is an example of socialized education.  Shadows of Nationalized Healthcare.          \nExcellent statement.  I happen to be in college, with the goal of obtaining a degree in secondary education (to teach science).  I want to teach, but I have already steeled myself for the reality of our education system.  I hope changes can be made to improve it, but like any large bureaucracy, it will be slow in coming.  Considering the starting salary in public education in our state is $30,000, most people think I'm crazy for wanting to do it, but it is my dream to teach and I plan to do it.          \nWe have the same problem in the UK: endless ridiculous testing.  I think its the Government wanting to control everything by measuring it.  Measuring something does not mean that you have it under control, it just means that you've measured it!  We don't need to endlessly test (measure) everything in school.  We have teachers who are professionals and can make their own, more accurate, assessment of a pupil's progress. \r\n \r\nThe Government here also wants to set a \"national curriculum\" which sounds a bit like social engineering sometimes. \r\n \r\nOf course Government statements always like to push the idea that its the delivery or the implementation that is the problem.  Always someone else's fault!  Its never their own dogma that's at fault is it???          ", "question": "\n    And not the product itself? \r\n \r\nLet's examine education from a scientific and economic point of view. \r\n \r\nWhy do all of the plans focus on product delivery?  \"It's the teachers.  They're not committed like in the old days.\"  Or \"It's the local school officials.  They don't know how to manage.\"  Or \"Parents don't take responsibility.\"  Much of that is true, but is it the cause of current problems? \r\n \r\nPeople end up attacking the labor unions of people who do the equivalent of board-of-directors-level corporate work but in a public system, for salaries comparable to the employees at Home Depo. \r\n \r\nWhy the focus on product delivery and NEVER the product? \r\n \r\nThe current testing mania has gotten to the point where in some places legally-required tests and courses take the majority of local school budgets.  Every dime of that goes to big companies like McGraw and Kaplan, not for teachers and supplies.  And the tests don't serve as a sample to measure what and how well kids have learned if the system has teachers \"teaching to the test.\" \r\n \r\nThe tests don't actually measure the kids' education.  They measure how far schools have changed things to match our system of measure. \r\n \r\nAnd for every low grade, a megacorp gets another multi-billion$ contract to snatch more school money, money that won't go to the schools that got the low grades. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, curriculum has deteriorated.  School security is either treated like riot police duty, or police states in miniature.  And sometimes (at the same time!) important security threats are ignored entirely. \r\n \r\nI personally know a public school teacher who has gotten to the point where he picks students he think can make it and meets with them privately.  \"The stuff I have to put in my courses may help them pass tests, but it's useless in learning how to write college papers, or read anything more complicated than a gossip website.  If I don't help them, they won't make it.\"  He buys supplies to use for these private tutoring sessions out of his own pocket.  He has been teaching for twenty-one years.  He makes approximately $33,000 a year.  In some places a first-year prison guard makes more than that. \r\n \r\nIn my job, I am involved in education in a non-school bureaucratic setting.  I know my boss would crumple up the average American high school curriculum into a ball and throw it in his little basketball wastebasket.  Then he'd drop the idea of contractors and go talk to our in-house staff and see what they could come up with. \r\n \r\nOur kids don't know math.  Our kids not only don't speak French or Spanish - they usually (native-born too!) don't really speak English either.  They think an engineer has something to do with driving a car and that Franz Josef is the name of that German kid being scouted by the NBA. \r\n \r\nSo my question is, with all the suggestions on how to address the crisis in American education, why the focus on the delivery of the product and not the quality of the product? \r\n \r\nThe product stinks.  Why are we ignoring that? \r\n.  ", "title": "\n    Crisis in American education: why is it assumed that the problem is delivery of the product?  "},

Also,  she needs to start taking a multi-vitamin daily until she has her appointment. \r\n \r\nIf she's not pregnant, her period being late could be due to stress or worrying that she is pregnant.  If she goes longer than 4 weeks without a period and a negative pregnancy test, then she needs to see a gynecologist to rule out any other problems.          \nShe might be but it won't be to you. You can't fall pregnant while you have your period.          \nShe could be. You may use a pregnancy kit to check or better yet, bring her to a gynecologist to be sure.          \nprobs \r\n \r\new u did it while she had blood pouring out of where u stuck your **** in          \nThe only way to know is to test. No one knows for sure hon. Sorry :-(  Thats my final answer!!! TEST!!!          \nShe can be and don't listen to the people who say its not yours because you CAN get pregnant when your on your period and thats how there's so many kids running around with no father's and end up on talk shows like \"I'm 110% sure I'm not that kid's father because.....\" and it comes back to be theirs.  So take a test and if she is you need to be supportive of her and if you have any doubts wait until after the baby's born and take a test.  Also if she is DO NOT have her take any vitamins until she gets into the doctor.  They have found in a recent FDA study that multi-vitamins have higher levels of the different vitamins in them then prenatal vitamins and can cause birth defects.  Wait until she gets into the doctor and they give her something.  You NEVER start taking anything without dr's permission, especially when pregnant.

I mean he was just my pot dealer after all. Then after a while we started dating and I totally fell for him...he was like the best boyfriend a girl could dream. If I wanted anything even very expensive I just had to ask him and after a while he would get it for me. He told me he loved me and that I was special girl everyday. He gave me pot for free but didnt let me touch other drugs. He made sure I stayed out of trouble.

Pack a good book too, and when you get there, just let your cares and stress go away.          \nI didn't stay at the Sandals resort, but we visited this paricular town on a cruise last May. \r\nIt was a lovely place, but when you go into the town to do any kind of shopping, be aware that the street vendors are very aggressive!! \r\nHaggle with them as best you can, there is always a better deal around the corner and you should say so, whether you know it is true or not.  \r\nThe people there pay a ridiculous tax rate on everything (even 17% on groceries!), so those tourist $$ are very important for them. \r\nTake the time to talk to the locals, that will make it a memorable trip. \r\n\"No Problem\" and \"mon\" are their favorite terms!! \r\nHave a great trip.          \nI've visited the Sandals Ocho Rios and it is beautiful.  Basically, any Sandals is equivalent to a Marriott or Hyatt with the added benefits of being all-inclusive.  The pool area is gorgeous and the  beach is nice.  I also highly recommend that you take the tour of Dunn's River Falls.  It is touristy but well worth the visit to climb the falls.  Also, take advantage of the opportunity to \"Stay at one, play at all\" of the resorts.  You have the opportunity to try out the facilities of all other Sandals properties without any extra charge.  There is the Dunns River property nearby and if you're game for some island exploration..... head over to Montego Bay or Negril for some great touring and eating opportunities.          \nCheck out TripAdvisor.com and type in your resort name in the search area.  Lots of reviews of previous visitors will be available to you.  I was near Ocho Rios in July and you will have to visit Dunns River Falls.  We also did the Canopy Jungle Tour which was COOL!  You go up to the top of a mountain and attach onto a zip line and ride the trees down.  It is thrilling.  We both hated the shopping and found it very annoying.  Jamaica we loved, though.  You will have a wonderful time.          \n          \nI haven't been to this Sandals, but I also recommend that you visit Dunns River Falls. \r\n \r\nI have stayed at the Sandals Montego Bay.  While there, we met a couple who had vacationed at the Sandals in Ochos Rios.  They were spending their last night at the Montego Bay property because it is so close to the airport and they wanted to have as much time to \"play\" as possible.  You can check out of your room but still have full use of the facilities for most of the day.  If you're flying Air Jamaica, you can check in for your flight on the property and there is a complimentary shower/dressing area.          \nit is great          \nbe sure to visit/climb \"dunns river falls\".          \nIf you want to stay closed in a great resort with other tourists and avoid locals, it's great. You're not going to see Jamaica, oh no...Hotel guides are going to take you to nearby Dunn River Falls and that's it.          \nfrist thing no problem mon and what ever other words u all think we use we don't, well maybe no problem but mon no way. i'm jamaican and if u want to learn jamaican creole talk to a real jamaican not one that use all those phrases. that, just makes me so upset to hear specially americans using that. anyway enjoy urself when u come here.and don't buy the first thing u c 4 the first price offered try talking it down. try to c as much of the island and meet some of the people, specially making friends with the people they'll know where to go to get u the best deals. and show u around. don't ever try eating too much jamaican food it might make u sick(spices).try jerk pork, my fav jerk chicken and try our beer.red stripe.don't over do things always in moderation \r\nsorry about not answering ur Q ,read 1 of the responses and couldn't help cussin a bit. ok talking to much now. c ya          ", "question": "\n    I'm not that much of a traveler,but I'm wondering if anyone has been there and what they thought of this particular Sandals resort.

One is exactly the same as this one in languages - Also answered four questions about shopping in Glasgow, differences between the USA and Britain, wearing thongs etc etc.  Very interesting answers on the languages site \r\nBTW  I have asked a number of female colleagues if they have found the French to be rude. \r\nAnswers have been (with one exception) unanimous.  The French - men and women are not rude and it all depends on your behaviour. with them,.  If you are snobby, overbearing or terribly pushy they will certainly appear rude.          \nTROLL!!

Also, when you say \"I was sitting minding my own business and some guy sat next to me and touched my leg\" That has never happened to any of my friends in 20 years living in Paris          \nWomen look at each other in France, it is not rude, it is sizing up and appreciating her clothes, make up etc. I do it, it is done to me, nothing to be bother about. Pretty women and show off can expect to be sized up even more. You're not saying what clothes you were wearing. Short stuff? Bared midriff? You can expect to be looked at, as you might have noticed among the millions of tourists in shorts and sneakers Parisians do not dress that casual.  \r\nYou can also expect to have the sleazy ones coming out of the wood as the way you dress shows that you are not local, young and helpless is even better for them.

They are part of the crowd of thieves and scam men who come every summer in Paris to graze on the tourist crowd. Learn to look for a cop in that case, at least in countries where the police is not part of the problem or if you can't see one raise your voice.  \r\nI'm just a bit dubious about the claim that anytime you tried to speak you got an eyeroll, I've never ever seen that reaction in 28 years in Paris. French don't roll our eyes, and as you will notice if you read about us we don't chuckle, laugh or smile either unless among friends.  \r\n \r\nAnd as a Parisian I can tell you that in summer we hide in the back streets.

There are many, many Mexicans that are white.          \nMexicans are not white. Goodness. Can people not see? Every Mexican looks totally different from white people.

Some Mexicans are mixed with Caucasian blood from the Spanish and some are simply natives which are remote descendants of China.          \nDepends on the Mexican. If they self-hate their Aztec roots they probably feel like they are marrying up the caste. Of course it doesn't apply to everyone :P          \nMexican isn't a race.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140330044748AABsRv5", "answer": "\nI agree with you about the term \"African-American.\" Not all dark-skinned people come from Africa--and not all of them were born there in the US. There are many CAUCASIAN people in Africa--and in my experience, several REAL \"African-American\" people I've actually known were actually Caucasian--one was from Morocco and one was from South Africa, and came from Dutch ancestry. Neither one of these was dark-skinned or even close to black.  \n \nThe government and some politically correct well-meaning people have tried to \"gentrify\" the language to exclude COLOR--because they believe that pointing out colors is wrong or bad. It's not always--mostly it's descriptive--but that's the society we live in. And it's not important. Racism is not dead, not by a long shot. Not anywhere. You're absolutely correct that racist problems are driven by skin color. At least in this country for the most part. And I also agree that muddying these terms only adds to confusion and misinformation.  \n \nBut that's what we have. And we have to live with it until something better comes along or we figure out how to speak about it without the sensitivity it causes.          \nThe only people who prefer the term \"African American\" over Black are the ones who for some reason think the word \"Black\" is a racial slur...          \nI think the term \"African-American\" was developed to make fun of \"retarded\" racists.  You see, racist Americans would discriminate against \"black\" Americans, segregate them, and tell them to go back to the jungle in Africa.  Even if the \"black\" person had blonde hair and blue eyes, but had some black ancestor 5 generations back, they'd still be segregated.  But if an unmixed dark skinned black student came from Sub-Saharan Africa, they wouldn't be subject to segregation.          \nYes, it annoys me as well.  I am white, born and raised in the UK.  However, I am not called a White American or a British American; so why on earth have things changed so drastically that we accept Asian American, Chinese American, Mexican American, etc., etc.  If we are born here, or naturalized we are still AMERICAN!          ", "question": "\n    OK, I'm a language Nazi and really resent the way my culture (American) eliminates perfectly acceptable words and replaces them with new words that mean the exact same thing.  \"Retarded\" is my classic example.  It's short for \"developmentally retarded\", which is an accurate description of that malaise.  But I'm not allowed to say the word I grew up with any more, I have to say \"differently abled\" or some nonsense like that.  Don't get me started on midgets and \"little people\". \n \nSo sometime in my lifetime, the race formerly known as \"black\" became \"African-American\".  This bothers me because it obscures the issue.  The antipathy held by the power structure in the US isn't directed toward a continent of origin.  Nobody ever has any problem with Africa itself, or Africans.  Heck, I lived next door to an African-American.  He was white, and fled S Africa at the fall of apartheid.  He never got stop-and-frisked.  The problems in this country(and racial problems everywhere) are all based on skin color and nothing else. \n \nAnyway, I'd like to hear from anyone who genuinely prefers \"African-American\" to \"Black\".  If you do, why do you prefer the term?  Don't you see that it just adds a layer of misinformation about racial stuff, and helps white people ignore the fact that racism is alive and well in this country?

I guess we have met different people.          \nYou shouldn't generalise people. But, it's safe to say that some people will get offended if you don't speak their language, especially if you're forcing them to speak your language. Never force your own. It's impolite. Try putting yourself in their shoes. I strongly suggest you master the French language and don't forget your accent. A language is not without an accent. If you are to go to some place, you should learn the language of the locals. Never expect them to speak your language. You learn theirs. Not the other way around. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.          \nPeople who learn a language, know how difficult it is. \nPeople who do not, criticize.          \nThey do love to hate people, that's true.   \r\nBut it's mainly because France is full of tourists often, and the locals get fed up with it and just want to carry on with their everyday lives without having to deal with someone who speaks very bad French and can't find their way to the hotel. \r\nThat said, they (we) are a nation of angry people who love to hate, go on strike and start protests.          \nIt is a bit of a stereotype, but I have experienced some interesting reactions of native French speaking people. (I am fluent in the Parisian variety). \r\nIn Quebec, the mainly French speaking province of Canada. I found that the native Quebecois feel that they are looked down as inferior with their ancient patois. When one speaks French French. they answer then in their broken English. \r\nI was member of a government delegation from Canada to France. We had a civil servant who was from Quebec and he insisted to address the Chamber of Commerce in Paris in his patois until a french delegate stood up, interrupted him and asked that he should speak English since nobody would understand his alleged French. \r\nSo they are rude to their own people and heritage.

Read a book by Josh McDowell called \" Evidence that Demands a Verdict\" (several volumes) Hope this helps          \nBecause down throughout the ages it's been tested and found to be true, working in the same way in our lives now as it was back then.  These days we have a more rounded philosophy, but the human experience has been one of anguish and joy.  If we need words of Wisdom for those times of anguish, why not during times of joy?          \nwow, I hate people like you, your a hypocritical, bigoted moron who obviously has no life if you don't have anything better to do then make fun of Christians! You say that Christians are delusional but obviously you are too if you think that doing things like this are a good idea.          \nHow can you call talking snakes, 900 year old people, animals on a boat, zombies, magic sky deities and guys who have superpowered hair &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot;? They&#x27;re in the bible, so clearly they&#x27;re true!          \nOnly Sola Scriptura Protestants do, like fundamentalists. \n \nMost of us understand that the Jews were recording THEIR perspective on what they thought God expected of them.  \nJesus spent quite a bit of time telling them they misunderstood most of it.          \nA lucid person will say that we&#x27;re the product of a vast mind. Not the byproducts of mindless biological processes. \n \nOk we can agree there is a God then. Who is he? \n \nWe can survey religious texts. The bible stands out supremely. \n \nDoes that answer your question? You&#x27;re heaving around terms like impossible and ridiculous suggests nothing but arguments based on insanity would satisfy you, given what I assume you believe about origins, human or otherwise. Have a great day.          \nPersonally I just think god puts people in out lives like you to test us and see how we defend our religion. If you do think you are getting into peoples minds saying this... You aren&#x27;t :)          \nThey lack the ability to think it through. If you were unkind you would say they are a bit thick          \nJesus replied, \"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\" Luke 18:27          \nI find it laughable that anyone would say that the Bible is not the Word of God and impossible, much less ridiculous.  ANYTHING is possible in reality.  What is not PROBABLE is often considered as impossible and your assertion that the Bible actually being the Word of God is ridiculous, is YOUR OWN opinion.  It isn't fact.  You can't say something isn't possible when it exists unless you have proof that the possible isn't what it appears to be.  You don't have that proof.  No one does, where the actual written words are concerned because not one single person is alive that was there when the words were first formed.  And ridiculousness becomes absurdity in the face of ignorance and lack of proof.          \nAtheists are a joke..dont be conned by atheists.  \n \nProbability and Order Versus Evolution  \nby Henry Morris, Ph.D.  \n \nOne of the strongest direct evidences for special creation is the existence of innumerable highly complex systems in the universe, systems composed of components occurring in a pattern of \"order\" rather than disorder. Creationists maintain that highly ordered systems could not arise by chance, since random processes generate disorder rather than order, simplicity rather than complexity and confusion instead of \"information.\"  \n \nFor example, consider a series of ten flash cards, numbered from one to ten. If these are thoroughly and randomly mixed, and then laid out successively in a linear array along the table, it would be extremely unlikely that the numbers would fall out in order from one to ten. Actually, there are 3,628,800 different ways in which these numbers could be arranged, so that the \"probability\" of this particular ordered arrangement is only one in 3,628,800. (This number is \"ten factorial,\" written as 10!, and can be calculated simply by multiplying together all the numbers from one to ten.)  \n \nIt is obvious that the probability of such a numerically ordered arrangement decreases rapidly as the number of components increases. For any linear system of 100 components in specified order, the probability is one in 100!, or one chance in 10158 (a number represented by \"one followed by 158 zeroes\").  \n \nA system requiring such a high degree of order could never happen by chance. This follows from the fact that probability theory only applies to systems with a finite possibility of occurring at least once in the universe, and it would be inconceivable that 10158 different trials could ever be made in our entire space-time universe.  \n \nAstro-physicists estimate that there are no more than 1080 infinitesimal \"particles\" in the universe, and that the age of the universe in its present form is no greater than 1018 seconds (30 billion years). Assuming each particle can participate in a thousand billion (1012) different events every second (this is impossibly high, of course), then the greatest number of events that could ever happen (or trials that could ever be made) in all the universe throughout its entire history is only 1080 x 1018 x 1012, or 10110 (most authorities would make this figure much lower, about 1050). Any event with a probability of less than one chance in 10110, therefore, cannot occur. Its probability becomes zero.  \n \nThus, the above-suggested ordered arrangement of 100 components has a zero probability. It could never happen by chance. Since every single living cell is infinitely more complex and ordered than this, it is impossible that even the simplest form of life could ever have originated by chance. Even the simplest replicating protein molecule that could be imagined has been shown by Golay1 to have a probability of one in 10450.  \nThere are only 10 to the 82nd power atoms in the entire universe. Numbers don't lie , atheists do.  \n \nTrue followers of God must avoid mixing with wordily people or you might get tricked into worshipping Satan as they do.  \n \nDoes avoiding atheists imply that our faith is not strong enough to discern truth from falsehood? That our faith is not strong enough to discuss different views? Not at all. In our ministry, we discuss with those who have different views. Atheists differ from those we meet in our ministry. Atheists are not sincere in their expressions. Their aim is to manipulate your mind, and undermine your faith. (Psalm 12:2 read) With good reason, the Bible then tells us to avoid Atheists, just as we would avoid a person who was infected with a deadly contagious disease. (1 John 2:18-19 read)  \n \nBecause they oppose the truth, Atheists are part of the Anti-Christ. They are liars and deceivers, out to destroy your relationship with God and his son, Christ Jesus. Therefore, we want to avoid them, for they are not of our sort. (Deuteronomy 32:46-47 read)  \n \nLike Satan, Atheists are unruly men who cook up wicked reasonings and season their brew with poisonous lies that deceive minds. Their preference is to partake of falsehood at the table of demons. Atheists are part of the seed of the serpent spoken of at Genesis 3 verse 15. If we wish to please God, we cannot be feeding at his table and at the same time be nibbling at the table of demons, eating from the hands of Satan\u2019s helpers \u2013 Atheists          ", "question": "", "title": "\n    Why do Christians believe their Bible is \"The Word of God\" even though that's impossible and ridiculous?

Inkjet cartridges are not meant to be refilled, despite what re-fillers would have you believe.  Ink formulations are proprietary, so after market producers cannot exactly duplicate it.  The fact that it does not work should not be too much of a surprise.  If you are refilling because of cost, consider getting a Kodak printer.  Their new refills sell for about half of what everybody else's sells for. \r\n \r\nedit 1) The evidence that refilling does not actually work, is in your printer.

See if you cartridge is properly fitted in the printer and the printer status moniter properly detects the cartridge. If not fit it properly. \r\n \r\n2. Your cartridge head might have block due to overage of time. \r\n \r\nJust soak you cartridge in luke warm water for 5-10 min. do not dip your cartridge fully in water, then take it out and press it lightly on a tissue paper, here the ink should flow quickly. \r\n \r\nIf nothing is one your tissue, then take isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab and clean it gently. and damp on clean tissue.  \r\n \r\nIf these do not work, then just purchase a new cartridge, and be happy.          \nWell assuming that 40 is a heavier consistency than 37 what you have done is blocked the print heads and possibly damaged the heater inside it. \r\n \r\nYour only choice is now to have the print head replaced in the printer. \r\n \r\nTake this a lesson that refilling cartridges is a false economy and never works properly.          \nThe ink cartridges for your printer is PG 40 & CL 41. \r\n \r\n \r\nPlease make sure you got the right cartridges for your printer.

Hell, no wonder they commit suicide...          \nand crazy! Wouldn't you think that they would get over the Qu'ran burning by now? But NO, they have been rioting in their own streets for a couple of weeks now, even after we apologized where no apology was required!          \nLarge numbers of them are leaving it, judging by this forum.          \nDoing this makes us overall better people, not aggressive. \r\nMost of us are peaceful, happy people. \r\n \r\nThe reason *SOME* Muslims are aggressive is because Westerners are occupying their land, killing their people and stealing their resources. YOU would be mad also if some foreign countries did that to you.          \nWhat is WITH this flood of anti-muslim posts today? \r\n \r\nLook, everything you said about Muslims could also be said of Fundamentalist Christians, okay? Just substitute \"the Bible\" for \"the Koran\".  \r\n \r\nAnd Fundie Christians are some of the most hostile, aggressive, violent (watch some videos of Tea Baggers. Read up on the threats to abortion providers and their children!!) people on the planet. \r\n \r\nNormal, moderate, everyday Muslims are no more violent or aggressive than anybody else.  \r\n \r\nSo just stuff your slanted world view - we don't want to read about it.          \nyea that doesnt sound like a nice life at all. Religion that puts such stupid barriers on people should be ashamed of itself. And I dont just mean the muslim faith, i mean all religions. Its no wonder people turn out the way they do when they are opressed by things such as religion. Even where I live, the Catholic church rules the land, basically, and for years people have been made to feel ashamed for the stupidest or naturalest of things. I heard recently the pope has said that IVF treatment is a sin, and if you cant have children you just have to live without. What a load of tripe. Thankfully i see changes coming though, the youth are not as gullible anymore and wont swallow it.          \nhow can you say that muslims are aggressive, what has religion gotta do with muslims being aggressive?! i dont get that Lol cause theirs alot of cultures in the world but you cant just say muslims are agressive because of stupid reasons like \"not having sex before marriage\" thats got nothing to do with being agressive muslims its just what we believe, other cultures can have as much aggression as muslims, muslims dont have to fast btw or read the whole \"Quran\" (its not koran) off my heart its up to them how they lead their life but we believe in fasting because we get to have that experience of what poor people have to deal with in the life today.          \nI  do not believe \"your\" answer is correct.  For U perhaps?  It's always is so easy to pick fault with others, their religion, or anything  else for that matter.  What is a negative to U, perhaps even to me at times; Is not necessarily to others.  This is where \"respect\" comes in.   It is difficult at times, however; we must,  MUST, RESPECT OTHERS, THEIR WAYS;  including the religions they practice.  I am a Roman Catholic by birth, yet I do understand the men's thoughts on how females in general are demoralized here in America..media;  \"they are right\"!   Anyone who disagrees with that: (in my opinion, needs more moralizing themselves. (Plus a few ethics courses, I might add).  What kinds of junk are we exposing our children/men to?  Don' most of you all out there feel it only contributes to the crimes against women?  Statistics show  illicit-pornography surely IS the culprit there/here from Internet's.  Adults who are mature, Parents, especially;  all understand this.  Plus, would probably honor the female, woman, wife, girl children and \"all other relatives\" it would pertain to,  in a different light if we could adjust our own practices and thinking.  It's just  quite differently here in America, as well as other places;  (but with more respect we could curtail many problems.) That's a given.  This is just one of the venues for discussion about \"their ways.\"  I think Muslims have some good ideas,.\"praying several times a day\" just another example. We should be that great/dedicated!   I mean it!  \"Not the terrorist stuff, of course, as I believe \"they just use the Museums as a front!\"  There are plenty of good loving Muslims, even here in America, as well as abroad.  The others, who worship their God, be it my God Jesus Christ,  or their own should be \"respected\" above all.          \nHave You Studied Some Statistics On (Abortion...Single Mothers...etc?)

Discipline him every time he gets into a plant. Eventually, discipline him when he starts looking at a plant with intention in his posture.  \n \nI have not been professionally advised about disciplining cats, but I suddenly inherited two of them. So what I started doing was\u2014well, here's one example. The cats wanted to rush into my room at my bedtime. They had never been trained about staying out of a certain room, so they were in the habit of going wherever they wanted to.  \n \nSo I did it 1/ psychologically. I felt masterful. 2/ I sounded masterful. I spoke in a loud, low voice. I picked up a cane, and I waved it at her. I said \"NO!!\"  \"NO,  YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE!\" if she kept crouching, and staring at the door opening as if it were prey, I'd say \"NO, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT.\" Just to make the loud voice last longer, not because they could understand. If she persisted in her intentions, I stuck the cane out and poked her softly with it while saying \"NO.\" 3/ I gave her a reward. Not food, but I made my voice all syrupy and said, \"GOOD GIRRRRRLL!!  a few times.  \n \nFirst it worked that way. \n \nNext, it worked just by my staring at her and holding the cane and saying NO! She didn't move, and then looked away. \n \nNext, I didn't say anything, just held the cane and stuck it out toward her a bit. \n \nNext I didn't have to do anything except check.  No cane, even. Then I'd say  \"GOOOD GIIRRRRRLS\" in the or she didn't move, or look with intention to spring forth and run through the door. (You can really \"read a cat's mind\" by their body posture.)  \n \nAnd NOW, almost always, they will not even BE in my room at my bedtime. They will have gone to sleep in their favorite spots. That amazed me the most.  \n \nYou are going to do this training in steps, and it will probably take a few days to complete. Start with just you and him in the room doing your routine with your plants, when he goes near one, first when he's actually physically touching one.  You walk over and say NO in that loud voice, pick him up gently but firmly and put him down gently and if he doesn't make a beeline for the plant again, you say in a loud syrupy voice,  \n\"GOOOOOD BOHYY!!!\"  a few times. That day, every time he goes near the plant, do the same thing. NO and some other loud words, and pick him up and move him away.  (If he turns it into a power struggle, just put him outside the room for awhile. Let him in and try it sll over again. Next step, but not the same day, use a cane or a stick. Never hit him with it, just poke him or shove him a little AWAY from the plant, while you talk in a loud voice if he doesn't listen to your voice alone.  Just point the stick toward him, eventually.  In between, when he is ignoring the plants, tell him what a good boy he is, and other things like that, in your singing voice. Next step. Put the cane away and just use your voice. NO loud and low if he moves toward the plant, and high sing-song talking in between. And then fall silent, and like read or something and see what he does.   Eventually, you might only say NO once.  Always use the loud low voice for discipline and at no other times.  Do as little as possible, for it to work, getting less and less all the time.  Finally, when he is never walking towards the plants, tell him a whole lot what a good boy he is. Remember, NOT walking towards a plant is a behavior, too, so you want to reward for good behavior.  I DO think they like the praise, but this is the first time I've ever tried to train a cat, because I have not had any cats for YEARS!!          ", "question": "\n    I have a cat that likes to tear up house plants. I started growing some tomato sprouts and right now it's not a big deal because I have a cover over them.

The only thing I can think of is to lock him out of my room (where the plants are) 24/7 until I can put the tomatoes outside.  \n \nThe thing is I'm his favorite person. Where I am, he has to be. If I have him locked out of a room I'm in, he meows and sticks his paws under the door. Even when I go to the bathroom.

They have all sorts of local plants...and also have 2 of the largest and most fragrant cannabis plants I've ever seen.  True story.          \ngo see the green grotto caves.  river rafting.  go up blue mountain its beautiful, coffee place up the mountain is great and theres a place to stop and see the biggest bottle of rum and get the taste of all sorts, leave feeling real happy. the veiws up there are great.          \nthe scuba / snorkling is not good in Jamaica,  the prob is that the gov't didn't have any kind of preservation plan in place so now the reefs are shot.  Although this will be overrun with cruise folk, you may want to try the 'origional canopy tour'  it is a total blast.          \nWe were in Jamaica last month and stayed about 15 minutes from Ocho Rios (Runaway Bay) and did visit Ocho Rios.  We went to Dunns River Falls which is very cool.  We also did the Canopy Jungle Tour which is a series of zip lines  you go down.  Very thrilling!  This trip was out of Chukka Cove which had cycling, horseback riding, atv tours, and a few more.  Chukka Cove is only 10 minutes or so out of Ocho and if you want activities it is a nice central one.  You can go to Bob Marley's home and even meet his mother in Ocho Rios.  For coffee plantations try the Blue Mountain tour.   \r\n \r\nCheck out TripAdvisor.com for info on that area.  There is a ton of stuff there.  You can even type in your resort in the search area and get reviews from people who have stayed there.  Be sure to check out the forums section which is a question and answer area.  Very informative!  Have a great trip!          \nCheck out the website :    They have great suggestions and companies to deal with. \r\n \r\nWhen I was in Jamaica I stayed in Ocho and did a horseback riding tour through a working plantation - interesting and a nice tour.  Ended with tea on the porch of the plantation.  Very nice.          \nHeave-Ho Charters!!!          \nfor diving , try Port Royal. thats were all the pirates used to come in and port. apparently , thats what the tour guide said. Blue Mountain is cool. Went on a bike tour there. Its was funny caus every three seconds some one was saying yeah man. My parents are Jamaican so the ja\"fake\"can accents were getting to me. Really if you want bit of the culture . Ocho Rios has a huge mix of it. Most of the restaurants there are local and you can get seom excellent food .  \r\nFor wild life , I would say to walkk in the mountains. Its ful of wildlife .  \r\nThe advantage of my family being from there is that Im not a tourist so i get to see all these things. I went back in 2004 for a family reunion and saw  hummingbirds .parotts , rabbits ,lizards just being in the country.  \r\nIf you ever get the chance to go to the country sdie , take it !!          \nduns river falls is fun          \nDunns River is a must! Do not go on the tour with the guide. You can go by yourself and take your time and hang out there. Alot of these things are going to be touristy. We don't like the touristy things so we always go the \"other way\" Where you see all the tourists, go the opposite. Ochi is a lot of fun. There is a local market and a local artist shop. These things are on main street the oher way from Taj Mahal. You will see and know when you get there. Margarittaville is overrun with tourists and REALLY pricey. Go to some of the local bars and support the Jamaicans who live there. Instead of MoBay, go to Negril. Alot more laid back and prettier. Snorkel in Ochi was ok. Negril is great for SCUBA. For the best food, stop at the little stands on the sides of the road. They may not look the greatest but the food is the best!Jerk Chicken is the way to go as is Akee and Saltfish (national dish). For the coffee plantation you'll want to go to the Blue Mountains. This will take a day trip. Don't be afraid to leave the resort. Go out and mingle and Jamaicans are big on respect. If you are nice, they will be nice! Have fun.          \nLots to see. Do include Montego Bay and Ocho Rios if you can. \r\nGo on line and check things out.  Also if you have the time before you go, call the Jamaica Tourist Board (800 number) and they will be happy to send you some brochures that you can browse through and make some simple inquiries. \r\nTry to stay with a group though, the crime there is bad. \r\nNo matter what you are told, stay with organized tours and groups unless you are the guest of a native and then I am sure they will be most happy to accomodate your sense of adventure. \r\nEnjoy your trip and be safe. \r\nGood Luck.

I am up for citizenship - just waiting for the interview.  I paid a lot of money to come here.  I do not begrudge that because the American taxpayer should not have to pay for others to immigrate, even legally.  I do begrudge illegals being charged less in some cases than a legal immigrant.  That would have been the case had the recent immigration bill passed. \r\n \r\nIllegal immigration is wrong.  It does not benefit the USA economically.  We should do whatever it takes to deter illegals from coming here on our dime.          \n32 pro reform Illinois          \ni am all for illegal immigrants.... to be arrested and deported!!! \r\n \r\nnevada \r\nage 40          \nI am against the US foreign policies that prey on Mexico and other Latin American countries, which in effect encourages immigration. I also don't like some of the policies of the Mexican government that encourages illegal immigration as well.  \r\n \r\nI know some illegals personally and have great respect for them. They are risking their life (and made a journey I'm not sure I could do) to have opportunity. They work hard and are good people in general.  \r\n \r\nI know that most people who are privileged enough to be born here could not make the trek here and risk their life for the chance to have a very hard, low wage job.  \r\n \r\nI know this country was founded by immigrants and our strength is on our ability to change and be flexible. Liberty is not just a WASP value. I cringe when people insinuate that freedom is not for brown people. I think that that is racist.  \r\nI think there should be a way to integrate immigrants though, and I believe in INS reform.  \r\n \r\nI am from california.          \n220% against illegal immigration(it's more like an invasion now), 40's Connecticut          \n100% against illegals. \r\n50ish. \r\nFlorida          \n200+million USA citizens an me against the amnesty bill it failed.   Florida  58          \nTexas, early forties. Firmly opposed to illegal immigration.  \r\n \r\nI have helped (and will continue to help) anyone wanting to immigrate.  \r\n \r\nI speak a couple of foreign languages and have lived abroad.  \r\n \r\nI fully agree with my American-Latino friends in \"You Don't Speak For Me\" (Pro-Security, Pro-Justice, Pro-Wall) and encourage their efforts.  \r\n \r\nSimply put, the law must be written to respect those who respect it.  \r\n \r\nPeople are not coming to all of North and South America by the millions; only to the United States. The land is NOT that different.  \r\n \r\nEvery nation on these continents is a European invention yet the illegals never acknowledge it. They want to come to the one nation that thel people globally are trying to enter and using the \"it's ours, too\" argument. What?!! If this patch is yours because Europe invaded, then all those other patches are equally yours, right?  \r\n \r\nSo, why is no one fighting to get into Honduras or Columbia or Nicaragua using the argument that \"we didn't cross the border, the border crossed us\"? And, \"We're only taking back what the Euro's stole?\" Funny, a simple DNA test will prove that most Caucasians in the Americas have quite a bit of pre-Columbian blood just as most Latin-Americans have quite a bit of European blood. Do they know where the word \"Latin\" is from? It's from the Latin word meaning \"Latin\". Which is European.  \r\n \r\nDitto the following: Hispanic, Spanish, Latino, Hombre, Amigo, Columbia... Which of those is NOT European?  \r\n \r\nIf these people ever get truthful about their fight, they'll be suicidal.  \r\n \r\n...          \nAgainst - 40's - Arizona          \nAgainst illegal immigration;Arizona;past the quarter century mark.          \nI am against illegal immigration... \r\n \r\nI am a citizen that resides in California & I am a 37 year old mom of 4 boys!          \n26 Tennessee I am against Illegal immigration, it's not that they do the work we dont want, Its that they do the work for less money, and Real Americans have problems finding work because of them.

I'm 20, In college here in WI.  \r\nAnd I am not against illegal immigration, but I'm kind of not for it. Why, you ask? I think we need to secure our borders, right? We can agree on that. That's realistic.  \r\nBut this is where we differ. Ok, we already have 12 million illegal immigrants in the country. We can't and won't deport all of them. They are deporting but for every you deport, 20 come in (i heard). So I go back and say we really need to secure that border (not close it), but we need to understand that we can't do anything but to make the ones already here legal. Legalize them. But they would need to do things for that to  happen, pay a fine, learn English (for those who don't know), etc. And give them they chance to become citizens 5-10 years after legalization. Hope you understand my view, it;s what an reasonable person wants. And enforcing the laws (if it ever happens) would only cause chaos. \r\n \r\nedit. . . . .  \r\n \r\nNo, I don't live where there are lots of illegal immigrants. But I'm from Chicago, and there, I have a house that I live in at an area where there seems to be lots of Hispanics. Some might be illegal but I can't tell. I don't mind them being around.  \r\nWhat people say about illegals is not how I feel. I know people's frustration but these illegals are only trying and wanting to work and making money so they can survive.  \r\nAnd even if I lived in a city in a border state where there was a high population of illegals, I still wouldn't think differently about them. I live in Chicago, and no, the border is not close, but it's almost the same.          \nSouthern California.  It is the pit of illegal immigration.  Everyone should take note of what is happening in California and how destructive it's been because this is what many other states have to look forward to if we don't get a handle on this problem.  I am so against illegal immigration.  I am of voting, tax paying, child bearing, alcohol buying age.          \nAgaint illegal immigration \r\nThe great state of Texas \r\nbetween 45 and 50          \nsunny CA, against, that's my secret!          \nI am very much against illegal immigration (like any sane person is), I live in Utah, and I'm 17.          \nmy age is 19 (almost 20). I live in NY.  \r\n \r\nI feel that it's not fair that we blame illegals for the problems here. And we shouldn't be mad at them. We should blame the US and the other countries because they are responsible for their people and if they are being forced to leave their country to enter the US illegally, that is not their fault.          \nI am against illegal immigration, pro legal immigration. Age,( here goes...) 52. Live in Las Vegas,Nevada.          \nI am against illegal immigration totally, Pro legal immigration and I live in South Carolina and 56.          \nI am against illegal immigration, period!  Whether they are illegals that just crossed the border or illegals that have been here for 20 years--THEY ARE STILL ILLEGAL and if they are ILLEGAL, they are CRIMINALS for breaking our laws.  The only resolution is to arrest, deport, stop the benefits, and militarize our border from this senseless invasion.   \r\n \r\nThey came here illegally and decided to raise a family so they can jump into the free chow line?  Come here legally and do it the right way OR deport the whole family.  Sounds too heartless to the bleeding hearts out there?  Not really when you stop to realize that illegals today are getting more free benefits paid by our taxpayers than millions of poor, disabled American citizens that will never get the same benefits from our government!  There are many hard working American middle class and low income working taxpayers (many work 2 jobs) that go to bed hungry, don't have proper housing, have no health care, can't afford medications for their illnesses and have no hopes of affording a good education, but the illegals do!  That to me is not only heartless, but despicable. \r\n \r\nAmerica needs to STOP handing out incentives (freebies) and allowing employment for these criminals, by doing whatever deems necessary to: \r\nSTOP employers from hiring illegals \r\nSTOP the anchor baby BS \r\nSTOP the subsidized housing \r\nSTOP the welfare and food stamps \r\nSTOP the free healthcare \r\nSTOP the free education \r\n \r\nThis illegal alien invasion is truly a form of \"terrorism\" that is bound and determined to deteriorate our country's infrastructure.

Theyve been giving away trips to this place on a radio station..just curious. But to answer your question I know nothing about this place..i bet its beautiful though          \nA wonderful place with beautiful scenery and very nice people.  The Jamaican currency isn't much, so the American dollar is very valuable.  The locals will bargain themselves down to nothing.  They will offer you something for say $60.  If you say no, they will go away.  Then they will come back and drop the price down to $50.  If you go long enough, you can get stuff for very cheap.   \r\n \r\nAlso, on your cruise, sign up to go on the Dunns River Falls excursion.  It is totally awesome!          \nI used to work on a cruise liner that went there. From memory when you get off there is a big open space and then you go accross to a load of cheap crap market stalls. If you go through these and come out the other side you can walk into the town a bit, but be careful because a lot of the locals take advantage of tourists naivity and can be a bit threatening.  \r\n \r\n     It's hot and nice though with that typical laid back carribean vibe. If you prefer, go on a guided tour of all the main local attractions. The trouble with a cruise is that you don't really get to see or experience anything real because you are not there for long enough.  \r\n \r\n     Well just relax and \"every ting gwan be Irie sista\"          \nthe place is very beautiful whare bread is made quite well.. \r\n      but the place is very dangerous.....as well as dirty          \nOchos Rios is the second most popular city in Jamaica, first being Montego Bay. Montego bay is the party city for Jamaica and is about 2 hours away from Ochos Rios. Dunn's River falls is the biggest touring site in Ochos rios and you can climb the falls with an experienced tour guide. Make sure you bring good waterproof climbing shoes or you will have to rent some for about $10.00 U.S. There are also a few stables in Ochos rios and you can take a horseback ride through the countryside that ends up on the beach! If you are into dolphins, you could try a visit to Dolphin cove, which is also close by. Negril is the city in Jamaica that is know to have the most crime but none of the cities are so bad you wouldn't want to visit. Jamaica makes almost all their money from exporting Rum and from tourists, so the people in Jamaica are super friendly and always helpful! Their income depends on it! If anyone asks how you are, just say Irie (eyeree). This is a national word there for everything is awesome! Hope this helps and you have fun in the sun on your Jamaican vacation. If anyone is looking for the best deal on resorts and airlines, we recommend this travel agency we used called Zoom Travel at www.jamaicavacation.com. They beat out prices from travelocity, Orbitz, and even Sam's Club Travel Services!          \nIt's wonderful.  Since you're going on a cruise, you won't have too much time for local tourism, but definitely do the Dunn's river falls tour.  It's great. Where else can you walk up a waterfall? if you have a full day, the Marley Bus Tour is fun too!          \nit is nice.

They do try to get you to kiss them (yuck) and feed them nasty little fish \r\nMy then-6 year old was afraid though so if you have kids, keep in mind that that might happen. \r\nWe went on this submarine in Cozumel that was really cool, but I forgot what it's called :-X          \nWe went on the submarine reef tour in Grand Cayman - it was breathtaking!  Try the town tours and get to know the cities.          \nIn Ocho Rios you have to climb the Dunn River Falls. That was great.  In Cozumel - swim with the dolphins or just rent scooters and cruise on the island yourself. careful not give boarding passes or credit cards.          \nWe're going to those same exact locations in less than three weeks. \r\n \r\nGrand Cayman - Pirate ship cruise, drinks and beach time. \r\nCozumel - Trimaran to snorkeling, then to a beach. \r\nJamaica - Local tour of some sights, then a climb up Dunns river falls. \r\n \r\nWe're also stopping at a place in Haiti for some pure beach time. \r\n \r\nCan't wait! \r\n \r\nGood luck!          \nHave been to all these ports several times.  You don't mention what kinds of things you like to do, so it's hard to give specific answers that would apply to you.  However.... \r\n \r\nIn Cayman, as others have said, you should go to Stingray City.  It's not a \"city\" at all, or even a developed area.  It's a shallow sand bar out in the bay [water will be knee deep to shoulder deep] where the stingrays gather because they get fed by the tourists.  It is a terrific experience, even if you're a \"scardey-cat\" like me.  You can arrange for this trip on your own - there are several reliable people who do this trip [Captain Marvin and Nativeway are ones I've used] or if you might have a tight time frame, you can do it through the ship.  The ship's tours will be VERY crowded, however. \r\n \r\nIn Cozumel, Chankanaab Park is beautiful.  [They have a website - check it out.]  You can snorkel, lie on the beach, take a nice walk past \"ruins\", etc, etc.  This is very easy to do on your own.  Just get a cab outside the port and go.  When you want to return there will be plenty of cabs waiting.  Just don't cut it too close on the time getting back to the ship.  Many people like to shop in Coz, which again is easy to do on your own.  If you want a less \"touristy\" experience, go in a block or two from the main drag.  Most places will \"bargain\". \r\n \r\nIn Jamaica, I would not try to do a tour on my own.  Everyone says that Dunn's River Falls is a must-do.  It is pretty, but it's also very crowded and unless you like to get wet while climbing up the slippery falls, this may not be your cup of tea.  There is a boardwalk you can use to see the falls without having to climb.  You might want to consider doing a \"party boat\" or some such that goes to the falls and back.  If you do go to DRF, you can avoid the annoying vendors at the exit by going back to the entrance and exiting there.  One thing we did that we really enjoyed was tubing on the White River [not to be confused w/rafting on the Martha Brae].  It was a lot of fun and very easy.  If you don't want to go on any excursions, you could walk over to Island Village, a limited-access [no locals] recreation of a Caribbean village shopping area.  There is a Margaritaville there, and if you buy a drink [soft or hard] you get a wristband that allows you to use the facilities.  It's literally a five-minute walk from the ship - you will still be harassed by locals to buy various things [legal and not] and/or get your hair braided; just politely say \"no\" and keep walking.  Some people like to shop in Jamaica and there is a shopping area in Ocho, but it will be a gauntlet of vendors.   \r\n \r\nFor more info on things to do at these ports, go to CruiseCritic.com, click on \"Boards\" and then \"Ports of Call\". \r\n \r\nHave a great trip!!          \nsince u have a few months...def. check out cruisecritic.com....I'm goin on a cruise in less than 3 weeks and have used that web side as my cruise bible!!!

It was great!!!! In ocho Rios i went to a waterfall and climbed it and I snorkeled. In the cayman islands i went swimming with sting rays!!!!! SO MUCH FUN! and in cozumel we went to the mayan ruins and also went to a beach! hope that helps and hope you have fun!          \nIf there's a Zip-line excursion do it. My wife and I did it in Hawaii and loved it.          \nDo the Dunn's River Falls in Ochos.  It is fun.   \r\nThere is a great 7 mile beach in Cozumel that is really fun.  They will have the banana boat rides that you can go on there.  Cayman Islands are great for snorkeling.          \nThere are a ton of things to do in Cozumel.  I recommend the Cavern by Jeep tour.  You take the ferry to Playa del Carmen and you get to drive a jeep to a cavern with an underground river.  You can swim in the underground river which is a unique expereince because they won't even let you touch the water in underground caverns in the US!  Then back to the jeeps to drive to a private beach with an authentic Mexican lunch. \r\n \r\nThe submarine ride in Cozumel is fun but avoid if closed in spaces bother you. \r\n \r\nThe dolphin experience was fun but expensive. \r\n \r\nCozumel is fun to shop...but avoid the mall.  Hit the open air markets for the best deals.  Bartering is part of the experience. \r\n \r\nYou should definately take one of the stingray adventures in Grand Caymans but skip the one that includes the trip to the Turtle Farm and Hell.  Those side trips take up too much time and are not worth it.  The locals in Grand Caymans are not as friendly as in Cozumel and they will not barter with you in the markets.  You have to tender (take the ferry) from your ship to the dock in Grand Cayman.  Allow plenty of time for this. \r\n \r\nNo recommendation on Ocho Rios...we were in Montego Bay.          \nThe most popular: \r\nOcho Rios, Dunn's River Falls \r\nCozumel, Swimming with Dolphins (alternate/cheaper: swim with sea lions) \r\nGrand Cayman, Stingray City. \r\n \r\nLots of other things to do, but these three are must do's!          \nDunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios was really fun, and beautiful, The best thing in the Caymen Islands is to snorkel or just swim at the beach it is also very beautiful there, when your in Jamaica if people follow you around trying to sell you stuff just keep walking and ignore them you will be fine.          \nI went on this same cruise on Royal Carribean Rhapsody of the Seas. In Ocho Rios, climb Dunn's River Falls. It's awesome. In Grand Cayman, go on the submarine. And in Cozumel, swim with the dolphins. BUT DON'T BOOK THROUGH THE CRUISE LINE!!! You don't need any prior reservations to climb the waterfall, and in the other places go on the internet and Google them. Book it through the company itself, and it will be a thousand times cheaper. Have fun on your trip! Hope this helps!          \nOK, it really depends on what you like to do.  My wife & I really enjoy snorkeling, my (adult) sons, do too, but they like some of the go-fast activities better.  That said, here goes: \r\n \r\nGrand Cayman \u2013 have done the Reef & Wreck Snorkel once, and the Stingray City Snorkel tour once, and enjoyed both.  The wreck is about 80 years old, in water shallow enough to see clearly, and it has coral growth begun on it.  Kinda cool.  And the reef portion of the tour is quite nice, too - good numbers and varieties of fish and plentiful coral and plantlife.  If you want to see the stingrays up close, the other tour is the way to go.  They swim all around you and brush up against you.  No injuries, according to the guides.  Potentially, you could do both of these, since they each offer a morning tour and a noon-time departure.  Similar cost, I recall \u2013 in the $50 per person range. \r\n \r\nCozumel \u2013 wife & I did the Palancar Reef Snorkel tour once, and the 3-Site Snorkel & Scuba Tour.  Palancar was good, but deeper than the tours in Grand Cayman, ranging from 15 to 35 feet deep, and you just drift with the current, so it\u2019s not strenuous at all.  The snorkel/scuba combined tour wasn\u2019t so good \u2013 the snorkelers enjoyed some drop-off points, the scuba\u2019ers enjoyed others, so the whole thing felt like a compromise.  Sons did beginning scuba (from the shore) and enjoyed it.  Also, they have just walked ashore and rented a scooter and tooled around town \u2013 but beware the police shakedown potential, being stopped for no real reason other than to get a few bucks off you. \r\n \r\nJamaica \u2013 Dunns River Falls is pretty, but can be a strenuous walk in wet shoes up a slippery path.

What ******* part of \"illegal\" don't you understand.  Murder is illegal.  Is there a middle ground when dealing with murder?          \nIf that 'middle ground' consists of having them stay here I'm not listening. That isn't middle ground.

You need to remember that ALL nations, even India, have immigration quotas to protect their own people. Turn it around.

Drive atround the island and see everything its a beautiful island and the people are friendly....but yes if your going to book an excursion, make sure you do it throug the ship because they do not gaurentee the ship will wait if you are late getting back from some private tour.....but in cozumel the island is not very big and so you have PLENTY of time to drive around the whole thing, stop at the beaches and play in the surf..the other side of the island is sooo great, a lot less people and beaches to yourself..jave fun          \nDepends on how much research you're willing to do ahead of time, how comfortable you are in being on your own, how good you are at watching the time and allowing for possible problems, whether you've been to any of the ports before, how many ships are in port, etc., etc.  Some ports are easier/safer to go it alone than others. \r\n \r\nOn your itinerary, Coz and GC are very easy/safe to do on your own; Ocho is not; Labadee is a private island so the point is moot.  GC is a tendered port and tends to have several ships in port at the same time.  Thus it can be hard to get around quickly.  Port time sometimes differs from ship's time, too.  Coz also tends to get a lot of ships at once, but there are three piers, so the arriving/departing crowds are spread out somewhat.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090821004849AAUQKJh", "answer": "\nFirst cruise....you have so many to pick, you'll need to do a little research and homework.  Fortunately, there a great websites, youtube videos, and books/resources to help you decide. \r\n \r\nFor our first cruise, we went to the Mediterranean on the Disney Magic. They spoiled us but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and were glad Disney took care of us from the moment we landed to the ship to shore excursions, Dinner, Shows, activities, etc.  Disney was great and the weather was perfect. \r\n \r\nWe then went with Princess for our second cruise to the Baltics.  Again, we were impressed with the Crown Princess.   \r\n \r\nNow is a great time to book cruises with the recession driving alot of cruise lines to cut their fares for all cabins.  Some offer great discounts for 2009 and 2010 cruises. \r\n \r\nwww.cruisecritic.com is a great web site that tells you info on each cruise line and cruise ship, both good and not so good.  But all the information is important so that you know what to expect and prepare for so you are not surprised. \r\n \r\nGood Luck and have fun!          \nHonestly speaking, I've been on three different cruise lines. Disney, Carnival and Norweigan.  \r\n \r\nDisney was by far better than the others, but it's more kid and family orientated.  No matter who you are you'll have a good time, but if you don't have kids, don't waste the money. \r\n \r\nDon't bother with Carnival. At all. They're horrible.  It's a floating casino.  They're unorganized, the staff isn't friendly or helpful at all, the food and entertainment suck, and the rooms are just an \"eh\" rating. \r\n \r\nNCL would be my pick.  The ships are beautiful, the staff is so friendly, there is NO DINNER TIME! Which is nice, because if you don't feel like going to dinner until 8, you can. If you want to go at 5, you can. And you don't have to get all dressed up! THere are more options for everything, the rooms are awesome no matter what kind of room you have.  NCL is always ahead of schedule, and as soon as you step onto the pier they're at every point along the way to welcome you and help you with anything you need.  They give you free drinks when you get onboard and they have lunch waiting for you when you board the first day. The shows get better and better every night, the food is fabulous, theres something to do for everyone, always. \r\n \r\nCheck out their website (its down below in the sources) and just search for a cruise in the time frame you want.  You can call their number and talk to a cruise consultant and they're there to help you, not get your money. They're all very nice.          \nIf you're planning to go in September, that really doesn't give you much time to do all the research necessary before you can book.  There are so many variables - no one cruise would be suitable for everyone.  It is also very late for making a reservation for September, although, since kids will be back in school and it is still hurricane season, you should be able to find something. \r\n \r\nYour ages will limit which cruise lines you can choose from.  You will then need to decide itinerary, type of cabin, length of cruise, which ship in which line, etc, etc.  Your library or bookstore has books that outline the basics of cruising, and they also have books on Caribbean ports of call.  Once you've done some reading, go to an experienced travel agent, who can help you book your cruise.          \nHi I had never cruised before and we took a Carnival Cruise out of Miami around the Carribean, had a great time and I am now on my 5th cruise in January, one answer says Carnival is no good but they are classed as fun ships and I would think that if you are under 50 (and I think you are) you should have a great time, (we are in our 50's) \r\nYou should get a good deal booking late.take a look at   and   \r\nyou can read reviews of other cruisers on the latter site even on a particular ship          \ndefinitely a caribbean cruise on royal caribbean international. \r\nbest service. best ships. loads of activities and fun!! \r\nplus the caribbean is so beautiful. you ll have a great time! \r\n \r\ngood luck and have fun!          \nWhen my bf and I took our first cruise, we went on the Carnival Legend. \r\nIt leaves from Tampa and our itinerary was Belize, Cozumel, Honduras, and Grand Cayman. \r\nIt was a 7 night cruise. \r\nWE HAD THE MOST AMAZING TIME OF OUR LIFE!!! \r\nSorry for the caps, but I had to say it loud and proud! \r\nAs for the negative comments about Carnival, please don't let that steer you away from them. \r\nFrom personal experience, they are far from a \"floating casino\" and the food, service, entertainment, etc were outstanding! \r\nWe are both 24 and not huge partiers, but we had literally the \"time of our life\" as the commercials say. \r\nI dont know what port you are leaving from, but honestly, as a first cruise, I think you should look into this one. \r\nBon Voyage! \r\nAny questions, email me!          \nPick one that you can drive to if possible. That way you save on air fare at least. Take a Carnival cruise, they are fun and less expensive then most others. Doesnt really matter where you go, just go!!!          \nBeen on several cruises and love the Caribbean.  Royal Caribbean had more class than most but I hear Carnival is the most fun. You will be treated like a king and queen on any of them.          \nAll of the Caribbean and the Bahamas are beautiful, so you can't go wrong there.  Since it is your first time, I would recommend Carnival, Royal Caribbean and NCL in that order.  You will receive great service on any of these lines, but because you are in your twenties, Carnival might be a better pick because there is always something to do.

Love is never hate.          \ngo ahead and leave he seems to have some anger problems          \ndoes he take steroids          \nYou should leave...          \nThat is somewhat scary.  Sounds like he has rage issues.  You need to have him get to the bottom of these issues so that he can learn to control his temper.  The scariest thing is--what does he do to you when he gets mad at you?  Not a good thought.          \nleave him but find a good psychiatrist for him          \ndo you see yourself ever being able to be happy with him acting like that? that is not anywhere near normal. that is abusive and it may only get worse.          \nleave him for your own safety          \nOH U SHOULD HAV BEEN LEFT WEN IT GOT OUT OF CONTROL          \nhe could be stressed from work or other things........kinda sounds like how my dad was and he got so bad my mom had to kick him out of the house....          \nIt sounds like your husband has some real anger issues. I would say talk to him about it first and then if change doesn't take place, leave. It also sounds like his anger can lead to abuse.          \nif you really want to leave then just do it, there is no point in staying with someone that you no longer want to be with \r\ngood luck          \nI'll address the only question in your post.... \r\n \r\nIs this normal? - No \r\nCan You leave him? - Yes if you feel that is the best thing to do. \r\n \r\nEveything else in your post is a statement - if your looking for someone to tell you its OK, well your the only one that can make that decision for yourself.... \r\n \r\nBest of luck, sounds like its a matter of time before he starts hitting YOU.          \nWell, after hearing that, I can't say I blame you for wanting to leave.  The sooner the better, as this violence is only going to escalate, and he's probably not the kind of guy you can have a meaningful discussion with, and solve some problems. \r\n    If you have family that you can count on, try to arrange some temporary accomodations with them until you get your own place....Count on him being angry, blaming you etc. etc. and he'll probably pull the sad/crying act when the blame game doesn't work.   \r\n       Eventually, you will hopefully find a guy who's a little more mature, and treats you the way you deserve to be treated. Don't settle for anything less...life is too short to be miserable. \r\n       Take the first step before it's too late...Good luck!  Dr. Harvey Glimebinder          \ndon't leave him. can you remember why you married him? he is obviously depressed and frustrated, don't leave him in his vunerable position..although it may seem more hostile than vunerable. marriages are meant to endure these hardships. try to speak to him when he is not in one of his moods, but calmly. Suggest going to counseling together. You are probably extremley fed up with him...but do you really hate him?? He is probably causing you a lot of emotional pain, but he seems to be struggling with himself. I'm not telling you to tolerate it, take action, but don't let this action be leaving him. Find some common ground to work with, counseling may save your marriage. There are many more options just than leaving him, marriage was meant to endure these terrible and frustrating times. I hope you do what is best and repatch your marriage.          \nI too have the same problem with mine. It has been going on for 20+ years now. I am very laid back and easy going and he is extremely aggressive and controlling. He has been jealous of me from day one even though I have never given him a reason to be! I know about not being able to laugh off the tiniest things. Doesn't happen. I walk on eggshells most of the time as not to upset him and send him into one of his tirades! I have had enough of it and I know now that it is time for me to go my own way. I have decided that I am special and I deserve a life that will bring me happiness each and every day. I just want to wake each morning and feel like the world is mine and not what he thinks it should be for me! I know I didn't give you much advice but I felt compelled to respond in support of your feelings and frustrations! If nothing else, realize that you are not alone! Wishing you luck with whatever your decision will be....          \nYou can try setting some boundaries for his behavior. Let him know that if he continues this behavior there will be consequences. i.e. he is losing your respect for him and let him know that you are going to leave the room or the house if possible when he behaves in such a manner. Go to a movie or get something to eat without him. If this does not have any effect let him know that if he does not get counseling and stick with it that you may need to separate. Don't keep silent. I had a similiar situation and afterward realized that I had not been honest about how I felt. I did not give him a chance to realize the extent of his behavior and possibly make changes.          \nHe  sounds like a time bomb.  Leave and don't look back.          \nHas he always been like this?  If he has just started to act up this way, there must be an underlying problem that needs checking out.  If this is the case, I am totally in agreement that you should not leave him but take your marriage vows seriously and work it out together.  i.e. visit doctor, counselling, anger management etc.          \nThings to think about: Have you ever mentioned to him that your thinking of leaving him because of the way he acts? I understand why if you haven't.. But sometimes when people realize they are going to lose someone they love and care about they take a good look at themselves.. he may not even know its affecting you-although he should!  And has he always been this way since you have been married or is this a new development? If he has always been this way and you strongly believe he cannot change then I would say you need to do what makes you happy! But.. if he has not always been this way maybe there is an underlying issue as to why he gets angry easily!  You mentioned he is depressed.. things like that can be worked through.. (if you want to stick with the marriage.)          \nIf you've done everything, then leave. Has he gone to a 'control your temper' meeting (not sure of the correct terminology). He needs to get his rage under control. Did you seek counselling? If you truly have done everything, and you are so unbelievably miserable, and you actually HATE him, then what is the point of you being miserable for the rest of your life? I think it's time for you to have something better. After all, you deserve to be happy too. Good luck to you!          ", "question": "\n    My husband gets angry over the tiniest things.

The only problem with Jamaica is the higglers (street traders)  who can be very persistent.  Many folk living in Kingston dream of one day being able to move to a place like Ocho Rios - much quieter and the city and very beautiful.  The nearest city to Ocho Rios is Montego Bay which can be a bit scary even for someone like me who has been to Jamaica several times (to visit family).          \nOcho Rios is not scary at all. If you're going to be scared of Ocho Rios then you'd be afraid of your own shadow. It's a lovely town (one of my favourite here) and there's plenty to do. The resorts are beautiful. Come and have fun :-)          \nOn trip advisor it is getting mixed reviews. Go here to read the reviews and see some photos \r\n \r\nclick on Caribbean than Jamaica search on hotel name \r\n \r\nGood luck \r\ns          \nOcho Rios is a very toursity area of Jamaica mixed with the locals.  It is not a city and the people as most Jamaicans are very friendly.  \r\n \r\nDepending on the type of vacation you are looking for if beach and sun is what you want then consider Negril.  \r\n \r\nOcho Rios has the famous Dunns river Falls and  \r\n \r\nThere is Port Antonio where you can enjoy the country without the toursim \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nCheck out this price \r\n          \nI am getting married there in August..I heard great things about Jamica!  \r\nGood luck finding out what you need!!

If you stay there, be sure to check out Dunn's River Falls, major tourist attraction. Even better is the blue hole - local swimming hole, absolutely beautiful. However, the absolute best place to visit in Jama is Negril by far. Best beaches, the best people, the best restraunts and 100% completely safe. Of course you may be pestered to buy crap from the local merchants like anywhere else, the whole attitude in Negril is different from the rest of the country, very laid back, hippy like. Go to NEGRIL!! you won't regret it.          \nI stayed there by myself for a month so forget about the scary part... its not (common sense applies of course... you are still in Jamaica) \r\nIf its a nice place to spend a vacation that depends entirely on what you are looking for. FP has a nice beach pretty close by (even if its pretty on the beach... the gate to enter it is like a block away) and its right in front of the cruise liner terminal so there is quite a lot of people and stuff to do during the day including shopping and restaurants and a lot of excursions like Dunn rivers or fern gully, there is a place where you can go and swim with dolphins and sharks another to go horse riding.. lot to do \r\nWhat i don't like much of that side its the night life.... the only place you will go to is margaritaville that is open only 3 nights per week... there are a couple of other clubs but its not places where tourist go (and don't know if you like dancehall anyway) \r\nIf you are a day person that loves the beach and nature... you'll have a great week if you are looking for nightlife then you are better off in Negril          \nOcho Rios is a lovely place.It is a great tourist resort.Lots of night life and beautiful hotels.I love Ocho Rios.You will enjoy it.          \nno dont worry. och rios is beautiful.dont just look at pictures but experience it for yourself. the hotels are wonderful with every thing you need, yes everything. the people are extemely friendly and the beaches are wonderful. \r\ni have been their several times.

This is great for companies, but bad for middle class Americans.          \nThere is no such thing as illegal immigration. White Americans are the minority. Soon you will be hunted down and tourted like the dogs you are. America will be defeated and Islam will conquer!          \nGreat point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!          \nbecause we have more important things to worry about - like the financial crisis.          \nIt is like anything else make the rule but then do not inforce it.          \nactually they haven't been ignoring it. \r\n \r\n \r\nhaven't you seen the news lately?          \nBecause immigrants do the country good, both legal and illegal.  Most parties know this but around election time saying the opposite is a vote-winner.          \nIt would be very politically damaging for either party to enforce the law. All our politicians care about is getting re elected.          \nMostly because the right course of action is exactly the opposite of what the vocal opposition has managed to shape in the minds of most people. \r\n \r\nfor 25 years this nation failed to secure the border, failed to let enough workers in legally, and failed to enforce the law when businesses hired these workers.    Why?  Because it was good for business.  That is inexcusable, but creating and enforcing a policy that is bad for business is just as stupid.   \r\n \r\nThe reality is that this country needs immigrant workers to sustain the economy.  Not so much now with a serious recession, but the economy will improve and we will be right back at it.   \r\n \r\nWe should have the immigration we need and it should be legal.  To that end we must recognize that the last 25 years was mostly having the immigration we needed, but not legal and above board.   Setting that right is not just about deporting all the workers.  Every intelligent person knows that, but is forced to provide lip service to the xenophobes framing the debate.          \nUnless you're an Indian you're here illegally too!          \npart of the problem is that certain segments of the economy benefit from the hiring of illegals, so politicians have a conflict-letter of the law in public pronouncements but practical benefit (and god only knows what else influences them) in private. \r\n \r\nIllegal immigrants are here because they can get hired and make money, very decent money from the standards of where they come from.  As long as they can find work, they will keep coming. \r\n \r\nSomebody, a very lot of somebodies, must be hiring these people.  And there is the heart of the problem.          \nWith a promise to the states to address the problem, the Congress granted amnesty in the 80's. There is a 2 fold reason for both parties have not addressed the issue.  \r\nThe Republicans will not address it and avoid deportation because the Democrats will attempt to capitalize on it and vie for the Hispanic community votes.  \r\nThe Democrats want the illegals to enter, the more the better so when they grant amnesty their voter base in the Hispanic community will be even larger.  \r\nThe dirty little secret is that all Congress and the president has to do is leave law enforcement alone to do their jobs. Just enforce the laws we already have, we don't need more. Deport them and re enforce the borders. Stop playing politics on our dime.

If you want to be in an orchestra, you can start right now by auditioning for a local youth or community orchestra. If you are wanting to play professionally in an orchestra, you also need to start building your musical resume by competing in contests and performing every chance you get. The fact that you have already won awards is good. You are going to use that to get yourself into a music program at a university with a good reputation.

As for the audition process and what you need to play, that all depends on the organization.          \nI disagree that you have to go to a special music school to get an audition for professional work in an orchestra.

The subway (metropolitan) has stops near spanish steps, Trevi fountain, vatican city. For 16 euros you can buy a metropolitan pass good for 7 days. If you decide to take the train from fiumicino to termini and then get on the metropolitan from the time you get off the train which is the farthest platform to the actual metropolitan line B you will have walked very far and with luggage it's a pain. line A is even further. \r\nI stayed at milton roma which was a twenty minute walk east of the colisium. But I think you might like something closer to Piazza Navona and vatican. Oh by the way the metropolitan pass is good for the line that takes you to ostia where the beach is.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090901143228AAYicNX", "answer": "\nnoo. thats just plain rude...and suspicious \r\ni would be furious if i were you.  \r\nsure, they r just \"friends\" but how well do YOU really know her?          \nIf you think this is normal behavior you need a slap in the face by Reality!!!          \ni would be very upset, that is not normal and i would be very suspicious, get a sitter and suggest he take YOU out instead.          \nNo, i'm sorry. \r\n \r\n:(          \nNope, not normal at all.          \nIf it is exclusively an Emotional Friendship, then I think the wife needs one too.          \nsuspicious.. it coudl be nothing, but it could be something..  \r\ni hope everything works out. !          \nNo that is disrespectful.          \nDepends on the circumstances. Are they old friends and she just got into town? If this is the case it's understandable. If it's not the case, start looking for a good lawyer because he'll probably be leaving you in the near future.          \nGirl, there is no way I would ever let my husband go to dinner with another woman.  I'm 23, but I'm not stupid.  Men are men and they try to sneak there way into making us feel like were wrong.  But we aren't wrong.  They are.  All men have one thing on there mind and I don't believe any different.  Sorry          \nThat's confusing?  Your friend invited a female colleague or your husband? Ask him if you can join.  If he hesitates, then maybe you got something to worry about, maybe.  Why would he need to go out with her anyway?   Business related?          \nNo it is not normal because it will be suspicous unless its for like something important like taking you to your job cuz your car broke down. But then if its not somethin like dat then your wife wiil think your havin sex with her          \nIt is absolutely wrong. If those are genuine colleagues, not a harem of ho's he wants to parade around with, he should pop for a babysitter and have you go too.  \r\n \r\nWhat the hell is he thinking????  He's NOT.          \nThe mere fact that you asked the question tells me that you allow yourself to be a doormat.  Come on, does it sound normal to you????? \r\n \r\nAnd why would you allow this man to do this to you.  I noticed that you first referred to him as a friend, then you referred to him as your husband.  Which is it???          \nAs a guy, I would say that he is probably having a \"relationship\" with her.  Doesn't mean he is having sex or evening being intimate, but for some reason he needs another female to bond with in order to meet his mental/emotional needs. \r\n \r\nMy advice, don't be accusatory, just ask him what they did or talked about and try to meet those needs.  Or if it doesn't bother you what they did or talked about, or if you are unwilling to meet those requirements, let them be friends.          \nNO, PERSONALLY THAT WOULD TiCK ME OFF.ESPiCALLY iF i KNEW THAT HE WAS DOiNG THAT i WOULD CLiCK ON HiM LOL. iT iS DiSRESPECTFUL AND iF i KNOW THAT AND i AM A 17 YEAR OLD FEMALE THEN HE SHOULD KNOW iT iZ WRONG.          \nall bad.  this is all bad.          \nit might be ok if they had jus bumped into eachother and got 2 talking but 2 plan it out and things like that  nah dat isnt kool id bring my wife along cuz when i get home itll be on hhaha but its all on a level of maturity not only on ur part but esceially on his part ..this doesnt meen theres sumthing going on its jus not kool unless shes really dang ugly hhaha its not like they are co workers u know or somthing like dat so it isnt kool          \nNOOOOOO!!! It is disrespectful, rude, arrogant and just down right wrong! My husband would much rather take me and the kids out to eat, rather than take some random chick from work.          \nNo, because there is no reason that he should want to spend more time with her than his whole family.  Plus, there is no reason why they should be together alone.  Also, that is not healthy for your children to see that.  They're going to think that it is normal for their father to see another women on the side.  Plus, if anyone that the both of you mutually know see them, what would they automatically think?  I would assume that he is cheating.  Also, he is probably telling her that you know that they are seeing eachother, and that it's okay with you if they have relations.  I wuold recommend you giving him an ultimatum.  Tell him that you don't like it, and if it continues that you will leave.  He'll know how you feel, and if he chooses to be continue seeing her, than he has obviously made his decision.  I hope that things don't escalate to that, but that is disrespectful to you. \r\nBest of luck!          \nI would have thought he should have discussed it with you first before extending the invitation to his coworker.   \r\n \r\nHonestly, if my husband wanted to go to dinner with his coworker, I wouldn't worry about it but we've been together a LONG time and I know it would never be anything but dinner.  \r\n \r\nI often lunch with coworkers myself or sometimes when I have a day off, I'll drive my husband to work and then meet a couple of former coworkers (both male and single) for coffee or lunch. On occasion I've met up with them for dinner after work.  \r\n \r\nIt's really not a big deal but these people are also our friends and we socialize with them together. \r\n \r\nI would say let it go this time but if it starts to happen regularly, I would sit him down and talk to him. It's one thing to lunch or have dinner with coworkers but if it's him and a single woman out for dinner socially on a regular basis, this is inappropriate. It would be disrespectful of you and your marriage if he continued. He should be spending that time with you instead of a stranger.          \nNo that is not normal! Everyone should go to dinner together or cook a meal at home. I suggest you find out more about the friend example(is she attractive, have they dated etc.) What is their reason for wanting to be alone together, unless its gonna be more than dinner. It sounds like dinner is a cover for something else. Trust me i've been there. Insist that you be included or offer to make dinner for all of you. If he gets defensive, angry, or is adamant that they be alone something is definitely going on!          \nTo a woman, no it is absolutely not normal. In fact, it does seem suspicious and disrespectful for the woman to come into your home, meet you and your children and then just leave with your husband to go to dinner. I believe there is a place and time for colleagues to get together, perhaps lunch while at work. Or a function where other couples from the job can also participate. For a single woman to be having dinner out, after work ours, with a married man is not okay and you have every right to be concerned. \r\n \r\nTo a man, however, it's perfectly normal and okay. \r\n \r\nMen and women think very differently, especially in cases where jealousy or suspicion may take place. Try to talk to your husband and get his stand point on the situation. If you do not feel okay with it, tell him and see how he responds. If he gets very defensive - then there may be more to the story. If not, and he is understanding, and cuts it out then perhaps it was simply just dinner and discussing business. \r\n \r\nYou know your husband better than any of us, so gauge your thoughts and feelings on how he is reacting. Good luck!          \nNo this is hardly normal & your guy knows it's not. He is just saying he thinks it's normal to make you think you're crazy for thinking the way you do. If it's business they need to discuss it should be done at the place of business. If this is a friendly visit then you should be included! If you were unable to get a sitter, he could have simply invited this friend to your place for dinner. I don't trust it.          \nNo.  Makes no sense at all.  Sometimes business will create situations where this COULD happen but more often than not, there is a way to include the spouse..and it just shouldn't happen without it being a large group.  NOT a one on one outing.  Not right at all.  Something stinks there.          \nOk I am confused you said your friend. Is it your friend that did this or your husband? Well if it was your friend it is none of your business. If it was your husband I would want to think that he was not stupid enough to bring a woman into your home that he is cheating with and introduce her as a friend to you and your kids. That would be disrespectful. So, to give him the benefit of the doubt for not being stupid I am going to say that if she is in fact just a friend and is in town and it is a one time thing you should trust your husband but they should not be gone more than two hours. Trust is a big factor in a relationship. Now if he takes your kindness and runs with it you knip it in the butt immediately. But if he introduced you it was a respect factor to let you know that she is just a friend. Trust your husband in this case because he could have went behind your back and then you should worry. If they go out to dinner again I would say ok let me a get a baby sitter and we all can go out as mutual friends. Married people should be mutual friends. If she is his friend and only that he shoudl have no problem with you being her friend too.          \nwell, it does seem a little awkward. however, since he is bringing her home and introducing you to her, i dont think she is a threat. \r\n \r\nif this is teh first time he is doing this: maybe he has a reason. give him teh benefit of doubt. the lady may have some kinda advice she needs from a guy and is not be comfy with you/a girl around. again, i dont think she is a threat. \r\n \r\ni would also suggest not pesterign him with questions about \"whys\" and \"whats\" when he returns from dinner. he is actign like a grown man (by bringing the lady home first - instead of pickign her up at her place and worse, not tellign you abotu dinner plans). therefore, you will need to be grown up about this one also (dont stress out if he smellsof smoke or a few drinks, dont sit by the door waitign either).  \r\n \r\nhowever, if he repeats it, then i would be concerened. keep me posted.          \nNormal, no. Inconsiderate, yes. \r\n \r\n  Just out of curiosity, if you had a guy pick you up at home to take you out to dinner and you left your husband with the kids, what would he say. We all know the answer, he'd be pissed. You should be too.          \nI'd be suspicious.  In my 20 years of marriage, my husband has cheated with one person (a co-worker)... before the affair began, I remember him talking about her and saying that she and I would get along great.  Him making a point to introduce her may be a warning sign.  When my husband and I discussed the affair (after-the-fact), he mentioned that believing the two of us could be friends was twisted into \"unconsenting permission.\"   \r\n \r\nBottom line, though, is that our marriage wasn't healthy at the time.  So before you succumb to my paranoia, consider the health of your marriage.  If it's strong, trust that feeling.

It's not safe in a lot of cities if you don't speak the language or know the social rules. Even if you do speak Italian, it's not safe for women to travel alone at night or on trains at night. If a man is too forward or assaults you, the woman is blamed if she is not with another person. They say she asked for it. People ask all the time on here... should I travel to Italy alone. Only if you are a man. Women can't travel to a lot of countries alone. Some would be fine and others are not fine. Most people give me thumbs down for this, but I've had too many problems.

It's not considered gay there, it's just what men do. \r\n6)You'd have to look that up on www.hostelworld.com or a similar website, because it depends on where you go and the time of year. \r\n7) People dress to suit the season, and stylishly. Obviously international fashion also has some influence. Natural fibres are the norm. \r\n8) All of it. Seriously, it's all good. \r\n9) Depends on where you're going.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090123194623AAVwhbK", "answer": "\nStop bangin the neighbor lady already.          \nLOL thats just bad luck. \r\nif she doesnt trust you then theres not too much you can do to take it back, she needs to  trust you before she believes you didnt cheat on her          \nmove.          \nooh that sucks.. \r\ntell her you love her so much and you would never do anything like that to her. \r\nand then call your guy neighbor and have him tell your wife that he asked you to clean the driveway for him          \nman that's good writing! try a romance novel          \nWhile she's distracted with your neighbor is a perfect time for you to bang someone else while her attention is diverted.          \nquit acting suspicious.  thanx for the laugh if this is real i'm sorry but once you get over it you'll look back and laugh.          \nI would think a smart thing to do would be to save the message, then have your neighbors come over together. This would be the smartest way to remove any doubts from either your wife or the male neighbors mind, should he be made aware.          \ni'm thinking its a joke but women......ugg....either talk to the neighbors and have them tell her that she isn't sleeping with you or whatever. and you are clear or try to convince her some other way          \nwow......... \r\n \r\nWell you might have to bring her husband in to confirm this. \r\n \r\nHonestly I would sit her down and ask her what this is really about. Do the old \"Honey we have been married __blah years and I love you just as much now as I did when we said I do. Do you really think I would give that up to have an affair with my neighbors (or best friends) wife?\" \r\n \r\nYou should also tell her something along the lines that if you did in fact have an affair with her she wouldn't have been stupid enough to leave a message on the home answering machine. I think you would be a little smarter then that, she should give you some credit. \r\n \r\nHope that helps          \nHave Lisa's husband tell your wife what was going on. Now if you were flirting with his wife, he would be equally be pissed off.  (maybe, some might be delighted), anyways if she knows of their relationship, I am sure she will understand.          \ntell her that she needs to \"clean up the mess at your house.\"  Or she can start having you do more plowing at your house.          \nWell, if your wife is not atubborn, why don't you print out this note. This asking. And also did you sit her down and explain. Even have the lady come over. But I am not sure that is the best idea. But i would stop doing her driveway, get another friend to do it          \nlol lol lol!!!! My sides hurt!!!  ha ha!!  =)          \nIts silly, you are both talking about \"snow removal,\" right?  Tell her that your friend asked you a favor, and God has said, \"Love thy neighbor,\" and you are following his words.  I'd be angry with her, tell her that you don't get this kind of icy reception, from your friend's wife!          \nIf your wife doesn't believe you when you tell the truth, then she either has good reason to mistrust you, or simply has her own set of trust issues. \r\n \r\nsorry          \nHave her talk to Lisa and get it straighten out.          \nif the ***** really said that she's just trying to cause trouble. \r\nbut i know you made this crap up.          \nWow! That's great stuff. Nine inches! You're the man!  Plow on!          \nYou even cleaned up your mess? You must have been sober. \r\nI dont know Ted....you got some splaining to do. \r\nHere ...I'll get you a drink. makes you think better.          \nlol, I think I would have done the same thing....ha ha ha ha. \r\n \r\nLook just dont give up on telling her nothing happened..if you do, this will give her more proof that you did. Oh, one more thing, get your old stuff out of your house!!!  Things like this ALWAYS get you in trouble.          \nSleep with who you want, but be discreet. Easy rule. Just remember: Who she sleeps with is her business and not yours, too.          \njust tell her that your not having and affair with the neighbor. let het know how important she is to you and that you would risk it.the stuff from high school tell her to let it go it was like a long time ago.          \nRemind your wife that you cleared her driveway too, allowing her to keep her date with her boyfriend.          \nI don't know...stop blowing her? \r\n \r\nHope this helps!          \nDifficult situation mate, just make your wife understand that you were doing a favor to Mike and that was him who left you the key to clean the driveway for lisa while your neighbor was away.          \nTell her you hate the neighbour. Tell her that she's shaved her nether hairs into a smiley face and it creeped you out.  \r\n \r\nOh wait-.....          \nDon't bother; the seeds of mistrust seem already sown. It's not worth the fight. I'd just leave.          \nIf it were me Ted, then I would just go right ahead and shag your neighbour then you wouldn't have to try and convince the wife that you weren't having an affair with her.          ", "question": "\n    Long story, but I'll try to keep it short. Last week, my neighbor Mike told me he was going to be out of town for a few days. The forecast called for snow over the weekend. He asked me if I could possibly plow out his driveway for him while he was away. His wife Lisa ( whom I have known since I was 12) works a weird night schedule, so he would just leave the keys in the truck and have it ready to go. \r\n  \r\n  Well, we got about 9\"inches of snow last weekend. I cleared my driveway, and then went over to clear theirs. My wife also works weird schedules and had no idea I had done this.  \r\n  After clearing the driveway, and shoveling off the steps and walkways, I left a note telling her I had done this and to make sure she took the keys back into the house. \r\n \r\n  She called to thank me a couple days later. She left a message on our machine that said \" Thanks for plowing me the other night...you do much better than my husband...blah, blah,  ...he usually makes me finish myself and clean up all the mess..blah blah...,,\" \r\n \r\n  Well my wife heard this and assumed she was not referring to snow removal. She accused me of cheating on her with Lisa.  She also brought up my High School yearbook where Lisa wrote the typical good bye / good luck thing  but added \" if you would have asked me again, I would have said yes!\" \r\n   \r\n  So, with these two pieces of \" evidence \" , she is now accusing me of having an affair.  How can I make her believe me?  I would rather not bring this to the attention of the neighbors.  ", "title": "\n    How can I convince my wife that I'm not having an affair with our neighbor?  "},

Too hot to go outside and walk a block, let alone go to the beach.   \r\n \r\nI personally like Siem Reap, Cambodia.  Plenty of temples (Raiders of the Lost Ark was filmed there), really friendly people (our driver showed up 15 minutes before we needed him every time), really inexpensive ($3.50 meals, $10 for a tuk-tuk driver for the whole day, $15 for a guide), and it has a fun tourist vibe and is full of foreigners.  It has a fun night market and also a day market.  Flights come mostly from Bangkok, so that would be a good place to combine.  No beaches though, and can get to be very hot and humid. \r\n \r\nFor beaches, I like Guam--it is like Hawaii with friendlier locals and some very empty beaches.  You can combine Guam with a stopover in Tokyo which is full of sites, is very modern, interesting, and clean.          \nGo to Thailand, you will LOVE it believe me. Great shoppings, beautiful beaches and lots of history and also modern. \r\n \r\nPattaya is good for beaches and nigh club: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPhi phi Island is BEAUTIFUL: \r\n \r\n \r\nAyutthaya is a very famous and historical place in Thailand, very well known and everyone who go to Thailand should go there, it was Thai kingdom that existed from 1350 to 1767. : \r\n \r\n \r\nVisit the province of Kanchanaburi, you can see Death Railway/The bridge over the river kwai, and many other historical site, I've been there and love it: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Ancient City or Muang Boran in Samut Prakan: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHere are the list of many Thai beaches that you can not miss  BEAUTIFUL!!!!! \r\n \r\n \r\nGO TO THAILAND AND YOU WOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BELIEVE ME!!!          \nThere are many great cities in Asia.  It all depends on what you are looking for. Here are a few ideas. \r\n \r\nIn Beijing there are great sites to see on vacation such as: the Summer Palace, the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, and more. \r\n \r\nIn Tokyo you can travel to the man made island of Odaiba to see space age buildings, electric cars, a monorail and the world\u2019s largest Ferris wheel. Take a day trip to Mt Fuji, Lake Ashi and Bullet Train back to Tokyo.  Consider visiting two theme parks at the Disney Resort.  \r\n \r\nHong Kong Tourism has much to offer.   \r\n\u2022  See breathtaking views on the top of Victoria Peak.  \r\n\u2022 Visit a shopper\u2019s paradise in Tsim Sha Tsui. \r\n\u2022 See amazing lifelike images of famous people in Madame Tussauds. \r\n \u2022 Visit the Hong Kong Museum of History.  \r\n \r\nBest, \r\n \r\nChuck          \nSingapore is turning to be a very beautiful city, give it a try. \r\nThe other gem in Asia, quite hidden is Bhutan.  \r\nHave a read about Bhutan and hope u will travel there \r\n \r\nFor travel deals in Asia, check out www.Wego.com          \nAgenda's agenda's.   \r\nCut through the BS.  Bali is the best place to visit in the world and trust me I have seen much of it.  \r\nSiem Reap in Cambodia is a close second.  But Bali gives you so many choices.  From world famous beach's to classic temples,  beauty on a scale that is hard if not impossible to duplicate and enough culture and art to make your stay memorable and personal.  From the highly touristed areas of Kuta and Legian to the deserted and romantic islands of the Gilis and Nusa Lembognan (no cars or motor bikes allowed) to the Culture and art of Ubud.  \r\nBali is just the best!

I think the ipad 3 has siri. Also the retina display from what I heard is pretty impressive, but I don't think I would give up my ipad 2 for it.          \nThe iPad 3 would definitely be a good present for Christmas.

Whatever the price, I love all my apple products and have been buying mac electronics for the past 3 years, and I'm always satisfied with the simplicity and mobility. The iPad does indeed have Siri, as it inheret iOS 5 which is put into all the iPhones/iPods/iPads          \nThat's cool, I am getting several video games, All Star Shoes, and hopefully an Xbox router.          \nI agree with Pip Boy, I generally don't like apple either.          \nAwesome, I have one :D \r\n \r\n          \nI believe it has Siri, yes.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20140322204002AAkxGuu", "answer": "\nThese questions are Always so subjective.......because it depends what you plan on eating, and where....and hostel availability....or whether you will need a better room, and so forth.  \n \nThere's travel expenses and perhaps Museum entrance fees.....hard to say what your DAILY quota will be.  \n \nTrains are cheap, but certainly not free.....and fines for being caught traveling without a ticket are steep.  \n \nI'd figure $75 to $100 a day..........but then 300 people will get on  here, and say that's either not  enough or way too much......and some clown will tell you how he did it all for less than $10 a day.  \n \nYeah, good luck with that........but trains and a place to stay, plus food..........you better have at least  75 **EURO** a day......and that's about $100, with the Exchange rate these days.  And that's a lowball end......assuming you find REALLY cheap accomadations.....and don't like to eat much.          \nAccording to Hostelbookers.com you can obtain a night in your chosen Italian  \ncities for 10 - 14 euros.  Meals can be cheap with pizza's found away from the  \nmain centres of the cities. Supermarkets offer cheap milk. Your biggest cost will  \nbe entrance tickets to the attractions like the Uffizi and Pompeii. \nI hope this was some help.  If you have a year to save you can afford a treat  \nthere every other day.          \nThis is hard question to answer.  \nYour main costs will be accommodation, transport and food.  \n \nFor accommodation try websites like www.hostels.com, www.hostelworld.com or www.hostelbookers.com. Some have ratings which are useful but you can put in the dates you want and see what the costs are. You will notice some places will be more expensive. I found Venice and Florence the most expensive.  \n \nIn Florence I stayed in a campground that had cabins....incredibly thin walls and about a 50 min bus ride from Florence but 10 years ago it was about 80euros for 3 nights compared to the same price for one night in Florence itself.   \nIn Venice I wanted to stay 2 nights in Venice but didn't want to stay in a hostel for both nights so split it. Had a lovely room overlooking a canal in a 2 star hotel Messener (10 years ago now). \n \nTrenitalia.com is the website to go to for trains. You can again put in dates and see how long and how much trains cost.  \n \nWhen I was in Rome I did a day tour to Pompeii, which I can recommend because I didn't have to worry about anything, just got on the bus and that was that. I thought it was good value as it included transport to and from hotel, lunch, entry into Pompeii and a guide. I wish I would have added on the extra to either Capri or Sorrento now....anyhow. \n \nBreakfasts are usually included in hotels (not so much in hostels), lunches would be about 10-20 euros and dinners 20-30 euros. I guess if you cook your own it would be cheaper but hey, when in Italy eat their food I say!          \n100 to 150 euros a day, as has essentially been said, would be my minimum to have a nice time.  Why go to Italy when you can't do or see anything that costs money?  I will say that when we go there we eat our way across the country.  It's Italian cuisine, and one reason we enjoy it.  In Florence we paid 120 euros for three, for dinner, and it was worth every centime.  I almost never eat pizza in Italy.          \nI agree the other answers, but I want to give you a last advice. If you want to eat the real pizza you should come in Naples ( the pizzas that the Italians do in the other cities are more different from the pizzas that do in Naples!) for the foreigners, the pizzas that do in Rome are great, but for a Neapolitan is not found particularly good... For this, you are enough time to visit Naples, which I think is more beautiful then Venice ( which is limited little more than the canals, gondole and Piazza San Marco) Naples has a lot more to offer. I recommend you to do so: \n \n4 days in Venice (in 4 days, maybe, you can visit Verona too)  \n \n5 days in Florence ( if you want you can take the train for Pisa, but Pisa has only the Tower and the Duomo, It's all here!)  \n \n6 days in Rome (there's a lot of monuments to see!)  \n \n3 days in Naples \n \n1 days to Pompei ( from Naples you can go to Pomepii with the Circumvesuviana)  \n \nAnd in all the others day from Naples you can visit Vesuvius, Herculaneum, Sorrento, the Amalfitana Coast, Capri, Ischia and the Royal Palace of Caserta. This is my advice, you have enough time to see much more! Good travel and I hope that you will like the Italy!  \n \nIf you want other info, you can write me in private!  \n \nExcuse me for my poor English!

Sardo, spoken in Sardegna, is virtually incomprehensible to mainland Italians.  In the Liguria region, near France,  the dialect is infused with many French words.

I cleaned them off and changed my password and all is well again and I got to keep the account.          \nNot had this happen as yet, \r\nbut why not get Rapport \r\nTrusteer the security that \r\nbanks suggest that we  \r\nsubscribe to.? \r\n \r\nIt is free and keeps out a \r\nlot of nosey parkers, well \r\nall those apart from GCHQ \r\nthat is.          \nNot for some weeks, but I just deleted them as I knew I hadn't sent them.          \nI have in the past but just delete them without opening them.          \nWhen you see weird spam coming in like you described, change your password asap.

On the other accounts, which I can no longer log on to, I initially received an email from someone using my own name (the name I originally used for opening that account).  Curiosity made me open them and what I received was an advertisement for vitamin supplements.  That was probably a sprat to catch a mackerel.  I did not do anything else - just closed down - but next time I tried to log on I couldn't and received a message asking for some personal details 'required to help me reactivate my account'.  I answered just one question - correctly - and was told it was the wrong answer and was then asked for further information which I did not answer.  When I tried to log on to the other account I received the same message but ignored it as I realised that some scam must be going on.  \r\n \r\nA few weeks ago I opened this account that I am using now as a replacement for the first one I lost, and on logging on this morning the first incoming email appeared to be from ME.   I immediately deleted it and am now using the account as normal.  It is the opening of these emails which give access to someone else.  Why they do this I don't know, whether there is financial gain I don't know or whether it is just to show that they can I don't know. Whatever the reason it does seem very sinister and leaves me wondering what these people are doing with my own account now that I cannot access it. \r\n \r\nTo any of you who have not had this experience, yet, I just wish to warn you so that you don't lose your account.  Someone else has told me that the biggest problems are caused for those who have a large address book and rarely clear old emails.  The hacker has access to everything in that account and can then send similar emails to all the names in the address book and continue doing this every time someone opens one of these fake emails.  \r\n \r\nIf you receive one of these emails mark it as SPAM initially and then delete it without opening.

Try coming at it from a friendly aproch first.          \nactually park up your drive or what? \r\nif they are interfering with your everyday lives for no proper reason then yeah go ahead \r\nor sink  to their level and do stuff to p them off - wouldn't recommend this tho - slightly childish          \nThe sale of your home is in the future  How much is peace is worth??          \neither way your going to have to tell people about the problems with your neighbours, so I would take legal action against them, if thats sorted and they behave then at least if you sell the house you can say it was resolved. \r\n \r\nCan you get thier car towed away as its on private property? I would ha ha          \nYou have a legal obligation  to tell prospective purchasers if you have had bother with neighbours. It's NEVER worth falling out with your neighbours.   \r\n \r\nI urge you not to take legal action.  \r\n \r\nI feel there may be more to this story so it's hard to comment further.  But for god's sake don't get into some kind of \"feud\" becuase it will consume your whole life, your health will suffer.  And all for a garage.          \nHave the vehicle towed away.  When the neighbors have to pay towing and storage charges to get the vehicle back, they may get the message.          \nYes, take them to court.  The court will most likely hand down an injunction, which is a court order instructing your neighbors not to block your driveway with their cars.  If this is handed down, you will then be able to call the police to enforce this injunction if your neighbors continue to park in front of your driveway.  \r\n \r\nYou going to court chould not affect your (or your neighbor's) ability to sell your respective homes.  This is a civil matter and it would not be an issue if you or your neighbors decide to move.          \nIf it is your land you can put up notice wheel clamping in operation \u00a3100 charge  to remove wheel clamp.Or you can put up notices and get a private company to tow the vehicle away ,than they can get it back for a release fee.          \nYou could do with advise from a Solicitor, I'm not sure whether you would get 1/2hrs free consultation on land matters, you could phone and ask. GOOD LUCK!!          \nThis makes no sense that the police won't get this resolved.  Both the police and the courts are in the same justice system.  All garages at people's homes are on private property.  If your neigbor is blocking your garage on your property, then the police have the right and the duty to resolve the conflict.  You should call and talk to a police chief or person in charge and not a patrolman. \r\n \r\nBut you can take them to court to resolve the issue.  Doubt it will effect the future sale of your house, but you are going to be leaving the same problem for someone else.          \nYou will have to tell a prospective buyer about an unresolved dispute anyway whether you take it to Court or not. in that respect you are in a no win situation.          \nStop whingeing you chirper; there is always two sides to the story!!!          \nI had a similar problem when my neighbour had guests as my neighbours friend parked in front of my garage. Then one time when I was out they parked on my drive and where pissed off when I came home and blocked them in for a week they asked me to move my car I said no as it was not convenient for me to move it, just as it was not convenient for me to be blocked in by them every time they wanted to park on my drive, again the cops would not get involved as it was on private land. So it was basically fcuk you to the neighbours. They did it one more time so I let their tyres down but only halfway so that they would not notice they where low on air and told them in no uncertain terms to get the thing shifted they crashed the vehicle not long after that and I have never had the problem since          \nIt is seldom a good idea taking neighbours to court, as there is always bad blood afterwards.  The police should be prepared to intervene where you need to go somewhere urgently and are unable to have access to your car and it is a pity that they will not help. The only thing for it, therefore, is to seek a civil injunction against your neighbours at the local County Court. The effect of this would be that if they were to block your garage in the future, they could be committed to prison for contempt. (That isn't as easy as it sounds: imagine living next door to a neighbour whom you'd had committed to prison!)  \r\nAs far as selling your house is concerned, you would have to disclose the action to any potential buyer if you sold within the next (I think) six years.          \nGo to court apply to claim all expenses against your neighbour in a civil action.  Keep them informed of the fact that they may have to pay for proceedings. see if it works , if not go ahead with a no win no fee solicitor          \nIn England and Wales, private companies may clamp vehicles that are parked on private land. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) now licenses such companies. \r\n \r\nMediation services \r\n \r\nBefore registering a formal complaint it is a good idea to try talking to your neighbour about the problem. If you find this intimidating or would like some support, various community mediation services are available. Mediation UK is a national voluntary organisation which aims to help resolve conflicts in communities. You can search for services in your area using their website \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nConsult a solicitor/take court action \r\n \r\nSolicitor\u2019s letter \r\n \r\nA letter from a solicitor may be helpful in making a neighbour realise that you are serious about your complaint. It may be particularly effective in making tenants realise that the next stage might be eviction by their landlord. It may also be necessary when, for example, there is genuine disagreement as to who is responsible. \r\n \r\nTaking court action \r\n \r\nAlthough a particular dispute may be resolved successfully through the courts, the relationship between neighbours may be damaged. It is also an extremely expensive course of action to take unless the complainant is eligible for publicly-funded legal services \r\n \r\nIf you take action against your neighbour you would have to declare this to the purchaser when you get the questions from their Solicitor, \r\n \r\nWhy not just put a lockable post in position on the drive which can be locked in place preventing anyone parking in that spot, and unlocked and drop down when you need to gain access to it, there is one here for 49.99 \r\n \r\n          \nIf you have an ongoing dispute with neighbours then it could devalue your property as you must declare this. Taking legal action could prove very costly.          \nContact your local security services company that has a parking enforcement section.  Contrary to some people's answers, you cannot put up a sign and clamp the vehicle or block them in or tow them away for a release fee legally, unless you have the appropriate SIA licences.  You can clamp the vehicle, if you have no intention to charge for release and you release immediately upon being requested to do so!  This would be far more inconvenient to  you though! \r\n \r\nA parking enforcement company will normally put up appropriate signage (Compliant with \"Arthur Vs Anker\") and immobilise any obstructing vehicle, upon your requst, normally without cost to you.  Costs are recovered from offenders. \r\n \r\nOne word of warning!!  If you clamp a vehicle, you may be accused of damage, even if you did not cause any - it is a common whinge from parking offenders.  Before clamping, take photos of the wheel to be clamped and the car after clamping, preferably showing the signage and the registration number in the same frame.  Also, what clamp victims do not realise is that it is actually illegal to attempt to remove a clamp (Torts \"Interference with Goods\" Act) and criminal damage if they break it off! \r\n \r\nMy suggestion is to get the professionals in - you can be sure then that the signage will be legal (It is amazing how many aren't), that licences will be held (Make sure you check) and the appropriate insurances are in place (View certificates).  All you will need to do is sign a consent to the provision of service that states the place immobilisation is to be used (It is a legal requirement for the service provider to have written consent to immobilise).  It is then fully legal for the company used to immobolise and tow away offending vehicles.  It does work.  Check the link for the legal details regarding vehicle immobilisers - good luck.

You need that police report to file anything with the insurance and since technically both of you left the scene of an accident you are both at fault. he may be in just as much trouble as you. Now what you should do though is MAN UP and fix your mistake pay off that crash as soon as possible and then some. he could have just as easily called the cops and you would be screwed.  \n \nAccording to Obi Wan the statue of limitations doesnt apply..  Unless a police report is filed at the scene everything else is void. Im not saying skip out but in this situation a few pictures doesnt mean squat and so I can say hey you are the driver still means squat. You cant go to a police station and say hey a few weeks ago i was in an accident and never called left the scene  and now since the guy wont pay im gonna cry about it.. it doesnt work that way. I have had this happen to my wife a few years back she was rear ended the lady driving said to exchange info and not call the cops we filed a claim our insurance sent a letter to the owner of the other car who at the time was in jail and his GF was driving without a license to verify everything  they didnt respond so the insurance after 30 days assumed our claim was valid. That police report is the golden ticket to verification. since both of you left he has some photos of what if maybe... ok if you and your dad wanted to be jerks about it you could lie but you should pay for what you have done. the only way this guy may get anything is if he goes to small claims court and can prove without a shadow of a doubt you and that car hit his car. and he didnt doctor some photos together and pull a random name from a phone book..          \nDon't listen to James on this. \n \nIf you don't pay him as much as he wants, you and Dad can end up in a world of hurt.  But the important amount isn't what the other guy wants, it's what your dad agreed to pay. \n \nNobody else saw the crash, but that doesn't mean squat.  If he files a police report and insurance claim and then you deny everything, nobody on earth will believe you.  You'll be asked things like if you weren't even there, how come this guy has photos and the plate number and can identify you as the driver?  You won't have a logical answer to that, and that's where you'll be caught.  The other guy has all the proof he needs. \n \nThe only good advice is for your dad to pay for the damage, and get a receipt for each and every payment.  If your dad refuses, he can and will be sued and the police will likely get involved.  You can face charges of driving without a licence and driving without valid insurance (you won't go to jail but it's still legal trouble), and your dad could face charges of criminal negligence endangering a minor (which could mean jail time), and you don't want that.          \nhahah, he does a good deed for you  by not calling the cops and now you want to screw him .

Most people who live really long lives are very healthy to near the end. People with chronic issues like COPD generally aren't survivors much past 80. Mom died last summer at 86 from cancer and it seemed tragic for her to die so young, just a year before her doctor had told her there was nothing she had that would prevent her living to 120. Her mother died at 98 from nothing, not keeping her body temp warm enough so went to the hospital a week or two before and they said nothing was wrong with her. Mom's sister will be 86 this weekend and survived cancer twice and heart problem. First cancer was almost 35 years ago, they said terminal but she needed to stay alive because she wasn't done raising her special needs son so she took chemo and it worked, 5 years later another cancer, about 5 years ago they said her heart was so bad she couldn't have surgery or it would kill her but not expect to live long. She still lives alone now she was widowed last year, maybe too stubborn to let the issues kill her.          \nThis true, I suppose there is a time for everything. Health wise some of us have good genes to help ward off many illnesses. Others choose risky lifestyles. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time can get you killed no matter how good of genes you have. Others battle life long illness for years without succumbing. Others hardly sick a day in their life, bam taken out by a simple bacteria get out of hand. Why do some survive a plane crash and others not with the same type injuries...

I am Attorney Fabian Yadao  a Legal Practitioner representing Rev. Fr. FERDINAND De Guzman,  My late client was a 64 years Old Filipino Catholic Reverend Father who came here in Nigeria in the 1945 with a black Missionary Rev. Sister; He left Philippines at the age of five(5), after The Japanese invading of the Philippines. He said the experience is cataclysm. However, he lived all his life here and owned an NGO which receives Financial Aid (Grant) from the United Nation and other conglomates. He died of Asthma attack, and since then no one has come forward to claim this fund he deposited in a Bank here, which he intend to use in establishing a foundation for Charity homes and orphanage centers in third world countries as he has been doing secretly. \r\n \r\nAlso to the issue-Based on my relationship with my client, he informed me of some wonderful ideas he wants to embark on which was to build one or two  churches  around the third wave countries and Asia and also donate monies to churches, and also to less privilege homes around the globe too with this deposit of US$2.800.000.00m he made through a CODED account in his local bank here in Africa which he gave me the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT to keep as his lawyer.  \r\n \r\nTHE BANK Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, had just started arrangement for the fund to be declared \"Unclaimed\" and subsequently be donated as trust fund for arms/ ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa for their selfish political interest/investment. In order to avert this negative development, I hereby need your cooperation in order to see that the Will of my late client is actualized. I can never achieve this objective without a trustworthy foreigner and this is where you come in. \r\nHowever, I want to seek your consent to present you as a relative to My deceased client by virtue of Power of attorney. As attorney to the deceased the responsibility to establish your relationship with my client rest on me and to achieve this objective, there are judicial processes involved, which I will brief you on subsequent correspondence if you indicate interest. Also take note that this is 100% risk free and legal. \r\n \r\nI am not pursuing this claim for the financial gain. It is a duty I owe to my late client who unfortunately was an orphan with no existing relatives and even as I intend to use part of the funds to establish a foundation in his name in the philippines; notwithstanding you will be adequately rewarded for your assistance in this endeavor I have decided to offer you 30% of the said funds. Expecting to hear from you as soon as possible, you can contact me on my direct private email: fabianyadao@yahoo.com and  while replying include your direct mobile phone so I can give you a call immediately for further details.  \r\nATTY.

Perhaps try in another week or 2 and if nothing talk to your GP. There may be other reasons for the spotting          \nYou could be pregnant because you had unprotected sex the day after your said ovulation day , now you are late for your period and that test was taken way too early for pregnancy to have shown since you took it 11days after ser sex not even 14days. The day immediately after ovulation day(on an ovulation calendar-predicted date not by testing with opk) is one of the days recommended for sex during your fertile window for pregnancy. Normally since you are supposed to test at 1week late after a missed period (since according to lovetoknow.com, testing immediately the day after your missed period has an accurate rate of only 80%), and you tested too early-thats not up to 14days after sex as recommended and still no period, test again in a weeks time if your period doesn't show up.

But they don't come on the news and say \"5000 airplanes took off today, and none of them crashed\" - all they report is the once in a blue moon when one does.

The concentration camps were in other countries as well.          \nSFAIK Germany did not have a higher percentage of Jews than other European countries.  \r\nIn Europe it was Poland which had a higher than average percentage of Jewish population - which is one of the reasons why most of the nazi extermination camps were located in occupied Poland          \nJews have lived in all European Countries for centuries, not more in Germany than anywhere else. In fact the word \"ghetto\" comes from the Venetian (not Italian) word \"geto\", meaning \"flow\" (of liquid metal). There are still a lot of Jews in Venice and they were a very important part of the financial establishment in the \"Serenissima\" Republic of Venice, since it was a sin for Christians to lend money for profit.  \r\nThe Jews were the only ones who could lend money and as such they were cherished by every king, ruler or merchant who needed money for whatever enterprise they had in mind. In the 15th century, with the beginning of the Renaissance period, philosophy changed every aspect of human living and banks were born (in Florence). They soon spread all over Europe. At this point the importance of Jewish financiers decreased and the Republic of Venice decided to keep them more under control by concentrating them in a single area. They had recently built a new foundry for their ship building (Arsenal), so the old foundry had become vacant and it was chosen as the appropriate area where to force Jews to live. (Incidentally it is still the area where there is a very high concentration of Jews in Venice today and it is still called \"Ghetto degli Ebrei).. \r\nJews were periodically  persecuted in every European Country through the centuries and always for the same reason. When some king or ruler was unable to repay them their loans , he invented some  story about Jews doing something terrible against Christians and heated up popular immagination, which turned against theJews (the most infamous acts against them are the Pogroms of Poland). Hitler did nothing new. After WW1 Germany had a terrible economical crisis and Hitler blamed the Jews for it, implying that the financial slump was due to the hoarding of money perpetrated by the Jews.          \nThere were about 600 000 Jews in Germany in 1933, i.e. less than 1 % of the total German population. Altogether there were about 9.5 million European Jews before the Holocaust and as you probably know, 6 millions of them were killed. Half of them were from Poland, where 10 % of the population was Jewish before the Holocaust.  \r\n \r\nKeep in mind that at the time the Holocaust happened, Germans had occupied a large part of Europe and killed as many Jews as they could in all occupied territories. Most of the Holocaust victims were not from Germany. You cannot understand the Holocaust without knowing about World  War II. \r\n \r\nI also want to correct one more thing in one of the previous answers where it was said that most of the German Jews had been \"housed\" in concentration camps in Germany, that's not true - most of those German Jews who were still in Germany in 1941 when the mass deportations started were deported to Poland to the death camps and ghettos.

I even said it was my honeymoon and they gave me a champagne bottle for my room. DONT spend too much in bigger , more luxurious suites because my wife and I went with the simplest room, with no window! We were like sleeping with the fishes hahaha and had a great great time. anyways most of the time you will hang outside, for the sunsets you really need to go to the upper deck, ASK FOR \" MY TIME DINING\" which will automatically exclude you from being seated with strangers and you get to have all your dinners in a private table. be careful if you like some of the desserts they will bring them all to you if you weren't sure which to pick. The service 6 stars . You will only need a bed in your bedroom and all the money you saved in not going to an expensive suite made it all up for the stops we made in Europe. Congratulations and I almost forgot, you can\"t buy spirits in lets say some island and bring it to your room... They will be safekeeping it until the end of the trip and hand it back. You can smuggle a bottle or two in your luggage when coming on board but you will risk it if they find it they will store it for you. Alcoholic beverages are charged. I smuggled a Bellini bottle from Italy and managed not to get caught. CONGRATS, HAVE A BLAST AND MISBEHAVE.          \nRoyal Caribbean is a bit more upscale with slightly softer d\u00e9cor colors then Carnival. For romance and class I prefer Princess. They have fewer kids and use soft, neutral colors in their d\u00e9cor. They don't have water slides, rock climbing walls etc because their customers. don't need all those bells and whistles. Quiet elegance and romance is the way I would describe Princess ships          \nOf those three, I'd go with Carnival - definitely not NCL.  If you want peace and quiet in a beautiful setting, try Celebrity.  They don't cruise in the Caribbean in the Summer, however.  Those other three lines will be loaded with kids [and adults acting like children, sometimes].  The decor on Carnival is definitely over-the-top - think Vegas on steroids!

The NCL was my least favorite. The food was mediocre, the quality of service was poor, and the most annoying part, the drink servers were worse than the vendors on a third world country beach.  I would have 3 hit me up in a span of 5 minutes.  Very annoying. \nCarnival was better than I expected. It was the cheapest cruise we've done.  I'm a bit of a snob, and didn't like the passengers much.  Lots of rednecks and people who had never been more than 10 miles from home.  I actually heard one complaining about all the foreigners at the ports.   \nI like Celebrity. The passengers tend to be more international, the food is fantastic, and the service is very good.  It's a tad pricier than the other mainstream lines. \nIf you are younger, I would go RCCL of the three you mentioned.          \nI'm a Carnival regular but if this is a one shot deal for you check out where the port stops are and the prices and take everything into consideration including the cost to get to the ship.

He travels a lot with his job and is usually in another country at least a week out of the month.  \r\n \r\nHe's a very social person and has friends in cities that he frequently visits (London, Tokyo, etc.) Part of his job is to take people he does business with out to dinners and out for drinks. So he is often out taking part in the cities nightlife. He has friends that are women in these cities and he tells me about spending time with them when he spends time with them.  \r\n \r\nThis summer he met a woman on a trip to Europe. She lives in another state and travels as well with business. He sat next to her on the first flight and then on the flight back by pure coincidence they were on the same flight. He has access to the frequent flier lounge area for American Airlines as he travels so much and on the way back he said he got her into the lounge with him and they had long conversations on both flights. He said that she confided in him that she was having marital problems and because he has been through a divorce in the past he was offering her advice.  \r\n \r\nAbout 2 months ago my boyfriend and I were out at a concert and I held on to his phone for him in my purse. I was a little tipsy so I read his phone text messages. This is something I had never done before because I always trusted him but I did it and he saw me doing it (although I pretended at the time like I hadn't and we never addressed it).

I checked his facebook about a month ago (I know its wrong) and he had a facebook message from the woman he met on the plane. It was pretty innocent ... he was just telling her he was in such and such country and asked how things were at home and she replied saying that things were much better at home and that they should coordinate their trips one of these times. He had also texted her around the same time and said he was in this great wine bar in London and that they should go sometime.  \r\n \r\nThe other day he had left himself logged in on facebook and I noticed that he had archived the email thread so it didn't show up in his inbox. He is not totally facebook savvy and didn't realize that archiving doesn't delete the email but puts it in a special archived section of the email. I checked his archived messages and that was the only one in it. I fessed up that I had seen his facebook email and that I noticed when he was checking his emails that there was an email from her but now he had deleted it. I know that they hadn't said anything indicating an affair but I wonder why he deleted it?? It just seemed weird that he had deleted it. He then told me that there was a bunch of stuff about her marriage in the email and he just didn't want to leave it in his inbox. I knew that wasn't true (and that it was just the 2 messages I mentioned previously) but I didn't want to press the issue. He also said that he wouldn't cheat on me because he loved me and didn't want to mess that up. He said that this woman was very nice and they got along well and that if they were ever in the same city he probably would go to dinner or lunch with her just as friends. I said that she was attractive and he agreed that she was pretty but that he wasn't attracted to her in that way. He also said that occasionally he does flirt with women that he knows or meets but that he would never take it beyond flirting.

Just stay from Holland unless you are 60+          \nJust to let you know of the 3 cruise lines you've listed. Carnival has the largest inside / oceanview cabins in square feet. \r\n \r\nFor the price, Carnival can't be beat. The food really good, I've been on several different Carnival ships and have never had a problem with the food, other than the burger grill being closed at 3am when I got the munchies.          \nCarnival was our first cruise and it was fantastic. BUT IT WAS OUR FIRST, therefore it will always be the best. Second was Norwegian, and we hated it. Now we travel Royal Caribbean (12 cruises)usually on the Radiance. Many of the crew now call us by our first names and they truely make us part of their family. \r\nHope this helped          \nNCL  (Norwegian) is best for non formal cruises.

I have been on 5 Royal Caribbean cruises, all have been amazing. Their new ship The Oasis of the Seas is the best cruise ship in the world. If its only 4 days then I am guessing it's to the Bahamas.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101110220903AA6NhuS", "answer": "\nIt is the same way in the town I live in, USA. The small mall is almost empty now and if anyone wants to buy fabric, you have to drive at least 45 minutes to get to a fabric store!  \r\n \r\nActually, all of this occurred when the giant Walmart moved in and undercut all the Mom and Pop stores ran by locals. They could not compete and lost too many customers to the industry giant.  \r\n \r\nI miss the older shops and as a result of my feelings, I do NOT shop Walmart!          \nOh, Gerry, you are so right. In my communty, in the early 1990s, I started a little community newspaper. It was free to readers, because area merchants bought enough ads that their payments covered the printing of the paper. After a few years, I moved to another state. Then I came back here three years ago. I thought of starting the paper again -- but when I looked at the business district, all hope was gone. Most of the shops were empty. There were entire blocks of empty stores which once were filled with businesses. The big bank building, with its greek columns, is empty and for sale. The little church across the street from my house is empty and for sale. It is so depressing to see a commnity _dead_that was once alive. This is due partly to the recession, and partly to the fact that the industries that once powered this area have left -- to other countries. So sad, so sad. I'm really sorry to hear that your community is equally afflicted. I thought these things happened only in the US. What is happening with our world, do you think? The answer is surely beyond me.          \nA business won't make it if there isn't a great demand for it here now. More people have become smart shoppers and fewer are using credit cards for their purchases, a hardware store on this side of town closed down, it was too close to Walmart, and for special items it is well-worth the trip to the other side of town to the big home stores.  On the other hand, thrift and resale stores are doing quite well. People are no longer shy about saying that they got a bargain at such places.          \nYes, there are lots of empty shops and sadly more houses for sale than I have ever seen.  A good deal of jobs are going to China and Mexico.  I don't know how these companies expect people to buy their goods when people here are losing their jobs.          \nYes. Walmart has killed the downtown area. Companies that were around since I was a child have gone out of business. It's sad. All towns seem to be doomed to become alike. McDonald's, etc.          \nMy husband, the two Yorkies and I recently made an RV trip to the New England area. We spent a week in a small town in New Hampshire where some old friends now live. I was amazed and thrilled at the many small towns, with a village that had shops, not department stores and absolutely no Wal Marts. Of course there were department stores and mega Wal Marts within driving distance, but there was one particular route that just rambled in and out of small towns with villages at their center. I was born and raised in the south and know I could never acclimate myself to the cold winters, but when I win the lottery you can bet I'll have a summer home in one of those New Hampshire small towns.          \nClosed and shuttered shops of every description, are becoming alarming evident in our smaller towns and rural villages. Charity shops are out numbering those businesses which still open their doors.  \r\n \r\nThe poor suffer the most, and maybe the pensioners get a lot of the blunt. This morning's TV is saying more vital cuts in the care of the elderly. Which frightens me very much. I am a pensioner and think that my worth has expired and I am just a burden on society.  \r\n \r\nAnd Governments take the easy way out of a recession by cutting benefits and threaten those who cannot fight back.  \r\n \r\nHave you ever seen the Governments create jobs for the long term indigenous (English born) and give preference to foreign and non-English persons in the job market. Multiculturalism and Integration isn't working in my opinion.  \r\n \r\nI have always felt isolated and alienated and never really understood the next door foreigner. In yesterday's news Germany's lady Prime minister was saying about multiculturalism not working with the Muslims named but one. \r\n \r\nAlso the employers of this country should be made aware of their responsibilities in re-training and doing more for the long term unemployed. Whole estates of unemployed and never had a job and never likely to have one again. Truly scandalous, and they say the unemployed are workshy.  \r\nBecause it is the easy way to address the problem.  \r\n  \r\ngivemestrength          \nWhen we were living in Las Vegas, some small shops did close down. Stores such as small pet shops and a few small hair salons,perhaps more but I didn't notice. It was more like large shopping centers being built but no tentants in the shops. Sort of like jobs for some construction workers with all the new buildings but no one to move into the shops once they were built. \r\nThere is over 14% unemployment in NV and really it's probably higher then 20% if you consider the part-time jobs and the jobs lost and not ever coming back. \r\nHere in Hungary, one of the large pastry  shops, it was over 90 years in business has closed down. There are several small shops empty on the main blvd. off of our apt.house. Seems many new small bakeries around town, mostly just selling bread and rolls, the one that closed was a fancy sit down shop. There is alot of corruption here in Hungary that is over looked by the locals since I suppose they are used to it having lived under communist rule for so long. With fresh eyes from the US, we are rather sick seeing how things go over here. People open businesses here with the plan to close down before they have to pay taxes to the government. The government is thinking of putting a new law on the books that if you lose 3 businsses in your lifetime, you are not allowed to open up a 4th one. People will get around that law though, they will just open under someone else's name. \r\nWe used to go swimming here at a small spa that cost about $6. a person for the day. Not super cheap for many people but it was a nice place to spend the day, in the 2 years we have been gone from Hungary, the cost of that spa has risen to over $12. a person. Don't know what they are thinking here, most workers only make about $25. a day, how do they expect the locals to use the spa? Seems it is a two class system over here, rich a poor. I hate to see anything like this happen in the US. \r\nNews here is that the former PM by face corruption charges soon, hopethen actually do something with him, he was outrageous with the insane deals he pulled to fill his pockets.Of course he isn't alone, heads should roll here.          \nNot too many. But the funny thing about this is that I'm always hearing about how bad this ressesion is, and how many people there are out of work and without money, but when I walk into either Walmart or the mall, or go to a Mcdonalds or a Burger King on either a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, there's always an astrnomically big crowd and the waiting time to get through a register at any of these places becomes longer and longer with each passing week. Not to mention the traffic on the road getting there and back. Go figure.          \nWhat a shame. My son just went back to England as he was bought up there and held england close to his heart and he said Mum I don't want to go back there to live now. I live in Australia and no our shops are doing well here          \nI live in a military area, it gives us some economic stability.  We haven't had too many closures here, mostly restraunts.          \nEast Kilbride has the largest undercover shopping centre in Scotland made up of 6 malls. \r\n          \nOur town doesn't have a High Street shopping area but an indoor mall.  There are as many closed shops as there are open shops. \r\nThere seems to be more 'cheap' shops than anything else - Poundstetcher type shops, cheap toiletries and greeting card shops.  As you say - as sign of the times.  I still miss Woolies though.          \nMy local city, Norwich, is looking ok at the moment but as you say one or two more charity shops replacing where there used to be specialised stores and of course good old Woollies. \r\nThe local towns are little more sparsely catered for now as we have lost an excellent butcher (I really miss him) and  a gift/stationers shop to be replaced with a mini Sainsburys, still it's better they are replaced than seeing bordered up, sad looking buildings and turning into a ghost town.          \nYes, For Lease signs, even for existing thrift stores.  Day laborers gathered on sidewalks early mornings, mostly Mexican.  Cash for Gold signs in front of pawn shops.  Cars and trucks for sale on private lots, even buses.  Signs of the times, indeed.          \nThere are several shops with \"to lease\" signs in the windows.  I do not blame the problem on the local Walmart that is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  They are making an effort to serve their customers.  The locally owned shops in town rarely open before 10:30 in the morning and are closed promptly at five o'clock in the afternoon.  One never knows for sure which stores are open on which days.  Most are closed on Mondays. \r\n \r\nI prefer to shop in small local stores, but they do not make it easy.  It is hard to understand why a merchant would not open the doors for business when customers want to buy things.  If they are paying rent and utilities and maintaining inventory, why not open the doors and do business?  They will actually stand inside their shops, keys in hand, and watch customers stand outside in the cold until the precise opening time before opening their doors.  Absurd!   If you are lucky enough to find a store open, there is no guarantee that the owner or employee will make any effort to help you find what you want.  Their response to a query is often less than helpful. \r\n \r\nShops are closing down because they are not being run well.  The ones that cater to the needs of their customers are thriving.          \nYes, thanks to Walmart....and then they pulled out and we had nothing!! The population of where I live is about 4,000 with many small towns close by!! We eventually got an Alco which is Walmarts seconds!!  We now have Dollar General and Family Dollar stores and their prices beat the big Walmart stores!!          \nA lot of it is the town's fault, knowing the economy is as it is.  If they really wanted to keep businesses on main street, they should promote their own and help business owners by finding \"mentors\" who have business savvy.  Those who own the property could give incentives by giving a break in rent.  The store owners could also all stay open until 9 one night a week...it would bring people in as a community. \r\n \r\nI live amongst many small towns in a rural community.  There are some who work together as a community and really promote their town and others that are nothing but a Post Office. It's up to each and every one of us, whether we want to continue our small communities or blow away in the wind.          \nI live in Michigan so it goes without saying that there are many, many businesses closed.  Michigan has been one of the hardest hit states in the US because of the auto industry.  It's not just the shops as in manufacturing.  Because of those closing smaller businesses have closed, too and support businesses like grocery stores, etc.          \nWe have two shops in the village near me (3 miles away) .If we need to do a big shop we have either a 40 mile journey or,a super shop,100 miles.No shops seem to be closing.          \nOur town centre & Serpentine Green shopping areas seems to be faring quite well. We are getting TK Maxx (would have prefered a Primark)move into the old Woolies store in the town centre. However one of the older shopping area`s has become very run down with Eastern European shops, cafes and fast food outlets.......In fact it`s become a dump.          \nIt seems like every week a few more \"thrift shops\" are opening in areas that use to be really nice shops.Most of my favorite ones are now closed and I use the internet to try and find thing I use to buy but cant find in the shops that are still open now.          \nI miss walking up and down the main street of my home town. We had shops on both sides of the street and two hotels. A large train station was at the end of the street and at the other end we had, (still do) a market house with a large clock on all four sides. City buses ran every half hour. There were restaurants and soda shops. Now Main street is empty and one of the hotels has been torn down. My father would sit on main street in his car, smoking his cigarettes and drinking a Coke every Saturday while mother and my siblings shopped. My grandchildren have missed so much of that lost era.  Poppy          \nSame in central Scotland where I am. Loads of \u00a3 shops opening and we all say \"Oh no! wish we could get some decent shops\" but the thing is we all use them. Lets face it, just one example why would you buy Flash Kitchen Cleaner at \u00a31.95 at your supermaket when you can get it in the \u00a3 shop or as in at the moment at Wilkinsons or Home Bargains even cheaper???  I was just thinking the other day that how much less I spend in the big supermarkets as a year or two ago. It must be effecting these 'big boys' as Aldi, Lidil, Home Bargains etc. are doing often the same or similar quality products so much cheaper.          \nWhat gets me cross is the way that local councils moan about the death of the town centres and then allow the shops to move to more modern premises on the outskirts. Many of the shops close down because these councils up the rents and rates making it impossible for the shop to make a profit. At this time of the year I love going to the old towns where the Christmas theme is far more in keeping with the season.          \nSo far - in my distant surrounding areas,  there have been few small shops closing but a number of large department stores & supermarket chains have closed locations which have been devastating for the neighborhoods & the employees.  Most locally to my neighborhood, nothing has changed dramatically - thus far.  The California economy is in flux and there will be areas about the entire state which will have entire business districts close do to lack of business due to the unemployment of their population.  It will be some time before CA will be in recovery since our plight is just beginning to erupt.          \nIn my town Rye east sussex just 1, but in the large town of Hastings lots and lots ,          \nAlas, Gerry my home town seems to be the same as yours. We have a proliferation of pound shops and charity shops. Many old established businesses have now gone leaving empty shops which add to the air of decay.          \nNot in the small town where I live now.  There are only a dozen or less, of small shops anyway, each of them pretty important to the residents here.  We all go into the city for other things. \r\n \r\nThe city near us has had quite a few closings.  However, there seem to be other new little shops opening all the time, as well.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090921164127AAmvRop", "answer": "\nI am so sorry all the bakery's and dairy's are gone, making it a true supermarket world.  Here in Southern Indiana          \nit's 50 miles to the store from where i live so i just buy it all at the supermarket and get it don e and over with.  And i only go about once a month so i have to buy enough to last me.   also have to hurry home in the Texas heat so that it doesn't spoil before i get home!  so it's a hundred round trip to the grocery store for me!          \nMost everything we buy comes from either the local chain market, Costco or Trader Joe's.  Some exceptions:  I buy fresh warm bagettes at the vietnamese bakery/sandwich shop. I buy lamb & olives at the ethnic market. I get my fresh fish from the fish monger at the ethnic markets.          \nUnfortunately, supermarkets or chains of warehouses such as Costco will inevitably put such small shops out of business. That is capitalism.          \nI'm not a senior but where I live there are still bakeries and butcher shops, contrary to what the others are saying.          \ni am 35  and buy my meat at a butcher and my milk is deliverer  \r\nyour qs isn't insulting at all! SOME ONE IS HAVING A HEAT FLASH  i grow my veggies too and we hunt \r\ni make my own bread \r\nand i have 2 kids ages 27 months and 5 months \r\nbusy woman          \nSure do. 1 block away with all of those in one.  Mt. Shasta. Ca.          \nIm not a senior but I would do it old style if I could.The distance to drive for each individual store would be a big time gas and money waster so it doesn't make much sense to do it this way.My city used to have all of these types of specialty stores,several of them.The big box types came in and they went away.Its sad really but who can stop progress.Things change,some for the better and some for the worse.In this case I think its for the worse,its made my little city lose its identity a little and kind of stopped neighbors from interacting,that's sad to me.          \nMy milk and eggs come from my own animals. My meat is predominantly from off the ranch and in my freezer. We tend a small garden in the spring usually and usually also in the fall. The Winter Garden District which is a large truck crop area in Texas is just east of us and when veggies are being processed you can fill your freezer if you want to go to the trouble, which we do. Our local mercantile supplies us with most of the items that we don't gather and or butcher ourselves. We take animals to the slaughter house where it is cut and wrapped, ready for the freezer. I love fried cottontail and that I shoot right down the road from the house usually. I enjoy going to the big super markets in the big city and I marvel at the wide array of food from all over the world that people can choose from. We do live in a remarkable time in history. Seafood,  which I love is available at the large supermarkets and we sometimes buy in bulk and freeze it but usually we just buy for today's need and do with that.          \nOur city and immediate area has butcher shops but , although the meat cuts are very good, they are also pretty expensive. My area used to have a number of dairies but that started going away about in the mid to late 60's. \r\n \r\nOccasionally, at this time of year, we have small farmers markets in our downtown area but there are no green grocers for year around produce. \r\n \r\nStill have several bakeries but the days of a nickle donut are gone. I am glad I was alive to see most of those things and, since my dad was a rural mail carrier, got to get plenty of fresh farm products. Actually had hog and beef farms on his route as well as a honey farm and a dairy. Used to get the real deal where the cream would separate over night and the first kid to get cereal took the cream( till mom and dad caught us) \r\n \r\nNow, the only fresh cuts or produce I get is from my own butchering or my garden or as second best, from my canning efforts. \r\n \r\nI think it was a great question and brings back a lot of memories. Thanks for the little trip down the memory lane.          \nNone of those exist around here anymore.   The farmers markets are almost done now with the change of weather coming.          \nOh, how I wish I still could get that fresh from the cow milk & that newly butchered beef from a slab hanging in the butcher shop window.  I loved the way those places smelled.  I can still remember the sights, sounds & smells of all those places...especially the bakery! \r\n \r\nIn my area, I'd have to travel far & wide to find these \"specialty shops\" & then figure out a way to get to them home without them spoiling in the hot summer months! \r\n \r\nIt's not less expensive for me to use the local markets when I factor in the travel time, cost of gas & waste from spoiled food!  Besides, I no longer eat meat daily or drink cow's milk!  I'm lucky to live where we have access to fresh local produce at a decent price.  A large part of my daily diet is fruits & veggies...sans chicken 3x a week!          \nWe don't have the benefit of the old fashion way.          \nI wished we still did. \r\nWe usually buy them at Walmarts or Hyvee in the KC area. \r\nBut I can relate to the old days when going shopping back home with my parents and grand parents.          \nWe do our shopping at a major supermarket. The veggies we try to buy locally grown at those veggie stands. We don't really drink milk, at least I don't and I won't. And as for meats, we are trying to cut back our consumption of meats. Working on going more vegetarian. But not all vegetarian. Can't give up on bacon with eggs for breakfast.          \nDairy is too far for milk, but we do go there for our fresh cheese a couple of times a year. A local dairy closed last fall, the cows are gone and the farm has been sold for a housing development. \r\nButcher - one nearby but dont go. I am not sure why... \r\nBakery - yes, very nearby, go there for holiday breads and bakery, as well as anytime I want 'good' bread, maybe once a month. We have cut way down on eating those items. \r\nProduce - many produce markets and stands around us and we frequent them often. We prefer to support our local growers. Things get scarce in the winter thought. \r\nAlso, we have many local small wineries around us and we frequent them too. :) \r\n \r\nThis is a good question, thanks for asking it. \r\n \r\nI wash some things by hand every week, and have been known to \"rinse out a blouse\" every now and then. Hands and knees for the floor only once in a while, I usually try to use my old cotton mop.          \nThere has been only one time in my life when I shopped the old fashioned way. I lived in Australia for a while and I loved getting to know the butchers, bakers and grocers. I guess I could get my groceries that way but the inconvenience, not to mention the gasoline involved, make it too impractical.          \nI wish I could shop like that I miss it very much. We do have a good butcher shop here and a few good bakeries left but the markets are making it harder and harder for them to compete with. We have fresh produce stands in the summer and I use them and they are cheaper than the market. I really resent not having the choices we use to have. I know I am showing my age but when my kids were young we had a milk man. He delivered the milk and brought it right into the kitchen and put it into my firg for me. He also delivered anything dairy along with bacon and eggs. The kids are all grown and gone now so I really don't need a milk man but I remember when the snow would get so bad that I couldn't get out to buy groceries and I could make a great meal with the things I got from the milk man. I hate supermarkets and I hate malls. I try very hard not to shop in either of them. Shopping is so boring today and so few choices. It is really sad. I love it when I go to Italy or France and they have so many shops to chose from and especially bakeries. I miss that the most. Your lucky you still have those little shops you can go to. I envy you.          \nhow can we when all the corner shops are gone          \nWhen & where I can- no local dairy (even in WI!) but several cheese stores.  A fantastic bakery is only a mile or so.  No meat market but a couple of sausage speciality stores nearby.  I'd kill for a good fish monger, all I can get is either frozen or in the seafood section pretending to be fresh.  99% of which comes in the back door frozen.  Summer is great when I can go to the local farmers market.          \nHere in the US I go to a supermarket, there are only a few stand-alone bakeries left around here, a butcher on the other side of town, the only stores considered a dairy store would be Braum's which also a restaurant/ice cream place. Haven't seen a produce stand except the local farmer's market which is open a few months through the year, half of the stuff comes from out of state there and is resold. I like to go to ethnic markets, a large Asian market is my favorite, carry spices, noodles, green teas and other things I use, usually don't leave without at least $30 or more in stuff each time. \r\n \r\nWhile in Morocco most grocery shopping was done at separate markets in the bazaar, butchers, bakery for breads, sweet shop for cakes and cookies, beans and pasta is at a separate stand, spices and dry herbs at another, and fresh herbs and mints at yet another and green grocers for produce. There are a few large supermarkets but they are miles away from most people and not convenient. And tiny little stores called \"hanuts\" that carry a little bit of all necessities, very convenient to buy from them to make dinner or get a snack, they don't charge as much as the large supermarkets either.  It's a pleasant diversion to walk around each evening and buy the necessities and browse at all the other little stalls too.          \nI buy everything but my meat at Super Walmart 6O miles away in the city.  I buy my meats from a little meat market that sells only freezer packages.  I always buy the 50 lb mixed package which is chicken, beef, pork, sausages(sometimes beef & sometimes pork) and bacon for $125.   AND sometimes he gives me a package of venison steaks that wasn't picked up by the person who had a deer processed.  I only shop once a month.  I'm sure there are bakeries and fruit/vegetables stands somewhere in or around the city but I haven't lived in this area long enough to know my way around very well.  The city is big and I get lost easily.  The little town I live in (pop 836)only has one convenience store/service station and a church on every corner.  LOL.          \nI shop in a small home town grocery store.  We have a meat counter where it is wrapped up right in front of you.  No bakery in town just the grocery store with its bread isle.  I could go to a super market down the road about 30 miles, but I prefer to stay in town.   \r\n \r\nWe know each other and visit while shopping.  The carry out boy knows my car and he makes sure I don't have to lift a finger.          \nIt's pretty much the supermarket in my hometown.  Although there are some great bakeries, most of them just sell pastries and have stopped selling fresh bread. There are a few good fish markets, and I do buy there frequently. But there's not a butcher shop that i know of, and there are only locally grown vegetables at a couple of farmer's markets and roadside stands during growing season.  \r\n \r\nI visit NYC about 3-4 times a year and I love the fact that there are still specialty stores like you talk about there.  There aren't many left, but the ones that are do a great business.  The fish markets are particularly interesting since they have many things that I can't find in my city.  I also love the cheese stores, and the bakeries are just out of this world.          \nThe \"progress\" of big box stores and giant super markets drove nearly all of those specialty stores out of existence here in my corner of Northwest Ohio.  I still buy my produce, whenever possible, at Farmers' and flea markets.          \nThese \"specialty shops\" are fast disappearing from the society and we are less ABLE to shop there for our groceries. \r\n \r\nWe have a butcher and I do shop there occasionally, but the prices are higher and I cannot afford the meat there on a regular basis.  I only use them for cuts that I'm unable to find at the supermarket. \r\n \r\nDairies around here do not sell to private individuals. \r\n \r\nThe bakeries are commercial bakeries.  I can only think of ONE bakery in town, and they sell mostly \"specialty\" items.  And, again, prices are not favorable to my budget. \r\n \r\nIn the summer, I do check out local produce stands, but they are further and farther between than ever before, and their selections are less varied than what is available at the supermarket.  There are Farmers Markets, but the days/hours are not conducive to when I'm able to shop.  And, once again, the prices are not always competitive with the supermarket. \r\n \r\nFor these reasons, the supermarket is the best choice for price, availability, convenience, and variety. \r\n \r\n \r\nHave a Seasoned day.          \nNo, though sometimes I go to the Farmer's Market.  Our Farmer's Market is open year-round, even in the rainy season.   \r\nI go most often to the health food store which is right next to the campus where I work & close to home, too, & it offers a senior discount 3 days/wk.  I also go to a small neighborhood store, but mainly for specials on local produce & an occasional splurge on a ready-made casserole or something like that.  Both of these stores have the local brand of milk, which is all I'll buy.  I like the juice blends, good for whatever ails you, at both stores.  The great thing about these small stores is that it's in & out fairly quickly. \r\n \r\nI also get a few things, such as bargains on tea bags, at Trader Joe's.  In Aug they had some good buys on the big containers of blueberries, so a bowl of blueberries with sliced banana was a routine luxury for awhile.  I also have fun at their sample bar. What a pig, going back to sneak seconds at the sample bar, especially if I haven't eaten yet  Tch, tch, tch. \r\n \r\nSometimes I go to Safeway.  They have a pretty good price on their organic oj.  For awhile I was hooked on their jalapeno foccacio (a big chunk of bread for about 70 cents that is practically a meal in itself, heated at home or at work in the microwave), but decided they were too salty & probably high in fat, no good for blood pressure & cholesterol tests that doctors seem to want us to take all the time when we're seniors, even those of us who are thin.  What a drag! \r\n \r\nLife was simpler when I just shopped at one store once a week no matter what.  Life was also simpler when we didn't have to worry about salt & fat.   \r\n \r\nBon appetit!          \nI live near a town small enough to have one grocery store.  The next closest one is 45 minutes away.  The big city is an hour and 15 minutes away.   \r\n \r\nI like the meat at the local store and I shop there for emergencies and whatever I forgot during our monthly trip to the big city.  I grow most of our vegetables.  We pretty much eat what's in season and I do freeze a few things.          \nNo it's the Supermarket. In the summer we do go to the Farmer's market and get fresh vegetables, fruits, baked good, sorghum, breads . \r\nFriends and neighbors also contribute fresh products.

It was a lot cheaper and a lot of friends & family reccomended it. I've also heard Royal Carribean was awesome but, more pricey. I never heard of the other one.          \nI have been to both Bahamas and Caribbean a few times and the Bahamas by far is nicer. ROYAL CARIBBEAN is going to be a much better experience for you. I've been on several curse lines and Royal has the most fun crew member, plenty of activites (the quest is one you should not miss) and their food is the best out of all the cruise lines! Plus they have private islands, like Cocoa Kay... Royal may cost a bit more but it is well worth it. Trust me, I am all about saving money and bargain shopping and getting the most out of a vacation. If you go with Roay Caribbean you wiill not be disappointed but if you go with one of the others, you might not get what you are hoping for. Spend the extra and sail on the best cruise line..          \nCarnival & Royal are more family cruises so you most likely will have lots of kids running around. For you 1st year anniversary as husband and wife you might want a more sophisticated cruise but still have lots of activities for you to do, for that reason i would say NCL (Norwegian) could be your cruise line. Have a look at their cruises, facilities and entertainment they have and see if its for you.          \nThe Bahamas and the Caribbean are both great places. But there's more to see in the Caribbean. I prefer Carmival over both of the other cruise lines. I've been on 6 Carnival, 1 Royal and 1 Norwegian. Carnival has a friendlier staff versus RCL's snobby and rude staff. Norwegian is a whole other story. My family will never cruise with them again. If you guys want to just party all cruise long, then definately Carnival, but if you want something more classy chose Royal. I'm going on Carmival Dream this summer to the Bahamas and Caribbean          \nI prefer the Caribbean and if you can afford it, RCCL.  Carnival is a decent cruise line as well \r\n \r\nIf you do go to the Bahamas - try to find an itinerary that avoids Freeport          \nIve been on 2 Carnival and 1 Royal Caribbean, and RC was better by far. It was also a 7 day cruise which I think helped. The buffet food on RC was much better than Carnival and the dining room food just slightly better. RC had better entertainment and more things to do on board also, and didn't seem so crowded. Carnival was more of a drunk college kids party on the last one I did (made the mistake of going during spring break) and was very disappointing. \r\n \r\nIf you have never been to the Bahamas, Nassau is really nice and Freeport not so much. Both cruise lines have a private island in the Bahamas which should be nice also, but its more just a beach break type of stop. No history or sight seeing or anything like that.  \r\n \r\nI prefer the caribbean just because there are more places you can chose from. Western isn't too bad but they ALWAYS seem to stop in Cozumel, which is OK if you have never been there before. And the Eastern you have the Virgin Islands and others that are very nice also. \r\n \r\nGiven the choices, I would chose Royal Caribbean to the Bahamas though.          \nMy opinion is: \r\n \r\n1. Royal Caribbean \r\n2. Carnival \r\n3. Norwegian \r\n \r\nThat said, don't pay a huge premium for a Royal Caribbean cruise over a Carnival.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090918084312AAOWBbX", "answer": "\nNo, I do not think leaving 15% tip is an insult. You want to leave between 15% and 20%. I would not go any lower than 15% unless the waiter/waitress was terrible. Very rarely I will go above 20%, but like I said very rarely do I ever do that.          \n15% is an average tip I give for average service.  I have given as much as 25% for exceptional service and I have given as low as two cents for poor service (just to make sure the server didn't think I forgot the tip).          \nIf they think so, tough! That's what they're getting. If there was a lot of work involved and the service was excellent, 20% or a little more. I've known a few waiters and waitresses. They have all bucked for 20%. Gee, I wonder why?          \nThere's nothing wrong with a 15% tip.  My suggestion to the waitress is to find another job.  If she wants more, she should do more!          \nKeep in mind that American wait staff are not required by law to be paid minimum wage. They might be making $3/hr and need tips to make up most of their income.  \r\n \r\nA 15% tip is generally mandatory for that reason. You should only tip less if the service is really poor (and if the poor service was the waitress' fault -- don't punish her if, say, your food is undercooked).  \r\n \r\nTo anyone who says the waitress should just get another job: if you *could* get another job, do you think you'd be working in a place that pays $3/hr? This is the kind of job people do when there are no other options or they're desperate for a little bit more money than their other job pays.          \nI'm a server and a 15% tip is not an insult. Some servers are just down right greedy.  In fact I worked with a few of them last night.          \n15% is not an insult. Give 20% for good service and higher for GREAT service.  If you're eating alone, you might want to tip higher than 15%, even for average service because many restaurants limits the number of tables a server can wait on at one time, so you're really paying for their time.  It takes about the same amount of effort to wait on a one person table as it does to wait on a two person table.          \n15% is average  20% for excellent service          \nActually tipping is not a requirement; it's a REWARD for good service.  I generally tip 15%, but increase or decrease the tip amount according to the level of service I receive.  If you want to see an interesting philosophy regarding tipping, I highly suggest that you view Mr. Pink's viewpoint early on in the movie \"Reservoir Dogs.\"          \nNot at all. For basic service, 15% is fine. Above and beyond depends on how much you can afford.          \nIf your service was just ok not over the top....15% is ok \r\nIf she really worked for you and was pleasant and made your meal nicer. 20% is good \r\nIf she went overboard and you only left 15% \r\nShe should not be insulted, but she will remember you. \r\nI hear waitresses say they get nothing or only a dollar for a group,,,that is insulting.          \nSheep wolf in your closet. \r\nOpen up and set her free. \r\nAwoo.          \n15% is an insult if your server did a good job.  It is a minimum tip.  Years ago this was acceptable, but seeing as how the hourly wage has not gone up in 18 years and the cost of living has, 20% is to be given if you got good service, and more if the server was really good.  See servers make $2.13 an hour, after taxes we never see a paycheck.  My last paycheck was for less than $10 for 2 weeks of work. So when I get a 15% tip I'm very angry. \r\n \r\nThe only time I would give 15% other than bad service would be at a buffet, because they don't serve you other than refill your drink.          \nno that is the perfect amount actually thats the average tip that some one would give and thats perffect!

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111003084045AAWC9in", "answer": "\n\"Best\" is really subjective.  I might love a cruise line, and you might hate it! \r\nI've been on Carnival, Princess, and Royal Caribbean.   \r\nMy favorite of the three is Royal Caribbean.  They have nice looking ships, great service, and good food.  I have *not*, however, been on their largest ships (Freedom class and Oasis class); I have no interest in being on a ship that big with that many other people. \r\nMy one Princess cruise was OK, but the ship seemed very crowded a lot of the time.  They added a passenger deck to the ship while it was being built but didn't add any extra public space, and the public space was laid out in a fashion that caused traffic jams.  And the dining room we were assigned to was difficult to get to and seemed very dark. \r\nMy one Carnival cruise was also OK.  The ship's decor was very gaudy, and the atmosphere in the main dining room (where the decor had a lot of chrome and neon) was not at all dignified.  The maitre d' even dressed like a clown one night.  Not my preference for a dining experience.  I'm giving Carnival another chance next month. \r\n \r\nTake a look at various itineraries to get an idea of where you might like to go.  Then see which cruise lines go there.  Compare costs.  Go to sites like Cruise Critic and read reviews written by people who've sailed those routes on those ships.  This should help you make your decision.          \nThat's very subjective.  NCL would be the lowest-quality of those three lines, but some people like the totally casual atmosphere they have.  Carnival and Royal are pretty even, quality-wise, based on what people I know who have done both say, with a slight edge to Carnival for food and service and a slight edge to Royal for the \"bells and whistles\", depending on which ships you're considering.          \nCarnival          \nAgree that Carnival has the best food but its atmosphere is more casual and catered to the younger crowd.          \ni have been on Royal and Carnival.  Royal's Explorer of the Seas was my first and i LOVEDDD it. the food selection and quality was outstanding, the activities were great, and we had extremely calm seas. my second was carnival. my whole family hated it. first of all, it was an older Carnival ship, so that may have something to do with it. it was the Carnival Miracle. its filled with elderly people (suprisingly) so the activites arent very fun. bingo is about the most exciting thing on there. the food selection was the SAME for every meal. same toast & scrambled eggs EVERY DAY for breakfast, same lunch items every day, same dinner items in the dining room EVERY DAY. the food wasnt all that great either. the decor was horrifyingly ugly, and the hallways with cabins were themed around \"Fictional characters\" so you saw ugly paintings of all sorts of random fictional characters EVERY FOOT. not even kidding. the ship overall was ugly and the same old stuff. i do NOT reccomend carnival, or older carnival ships, but royal is great.          \nAll three are pretty good cruise lines, but if you want to take a honeymoon cruise, DO NOT take it on one of the newer ships on Royal Caribbean.  There are just too many people on board those ships and although there is a lot to do on these ships, it's like applying for a job: there are 600 people trying to do the same thing you are and there's not much room for everyone.  Carnival is a great cruise line and I have fun every time I go with them.  Same for Norwegian.  I like the laid-back, casual atmosphere they have aboard their ships, especially dining when you want to b/t 6-10pm in any restaurant on the ship.  Try a ship just below the class of the newer ship and I'm sure you will be delighted with the choice and the trip.          \nive been on royal carribean, monarch of the seas. it's such a beautiful ship, many things to do.. not many kids which was what i liked about it. \r\n \r\nim going on canival in november, i hope its just as great. \r\n \r\ngood luck!

Now I did. \r\nso.. what do I think of it... \r\nIt really is quite convincing. It makes you feel like it really is the best thing for everybody. It also kind of scared me, because I guess all those money he says would be saved are probably the money that people like me (whose main business is language teaching and translation) would not earn any longer. Nevertheless I find it illuminating and I saved the link because I want my husband to watch it. \r\nWe both have already studied some Esperanto and we are enthusiastic about it, even if this doesn't stop me from enjoying learning other languages.          \nHe got some of the points right. \r\nEnglish are not really efficient, and sometimes it is puzzling to non-native speakers. \r\n \r\nEsperanto is a new language, compared to English. Thus it has not went through any evolution on the language which can create interesting effects on the language itself (which in turn, creates anomalies, abnormalities, inconsistencies, in the language) \r\n \r\nHowever, even though Esperanto is ideal, it is too ideal. I doubt that it will replace English as the lingua france, not within these 30 - 40 years.  \r\n \r\nPeople's mindset over English as lingua france is way too strong, most Asians here doesn't even know what is Esperanto. Plus, Esperanto is a language created recently, it does not really has much root in culture, traditions, and more importantly, people's heart. \r\n \r\nHowever, I have read that Esperanto can accelerate language acquisitions, I will definitely want to try Esperanto.          \nIt was a thought provoking video, but the thoughts it provoked ultimately led me to the conclusion that I don't agree.   \r\n \r\nThe speaker says that people often have difficulty speaking fluently in English, despite having studied it in school for six or seven years.  This is certainly true.  But anything you study in school will be difficult for you to recall if you do not use it practically in your day to day life.  The same would be true for Esperanto, if the speaker's goal of having it universally taught came to pass - most people would learn it, rarely use it (because they were using their native language instead unless dealing with foreigners regularly) and have trouble speaking it if they suddenly needed to years later.   \r\n \r\nRight now, many people have to go to conferences on the subject of their profession (law, engineering, finance) etc. which are held in English - and they go there not because they have any particular interest in the English language, but because they are interested in the topic, or have to go for their job.  Naturally, some of them have difficulty expressing themselves in English when they get there.   \r\n \r\nNo one goes or gets sent to a conference in Esperanto unless they have made their own, free choice to devote a good deal of time and energy to studying the language for its own sake.  Anyone who goes out of their way to attend a conference like this is likely to speak it well, and enjoy speaking it, so they will be more natural and at ease. \r\n \r\nThis brings up another point - most people learn languages because they want to be able to understand things from another country - whether it is poetry, music, movies or scientific publications. While some of these things are available in Esperanto, there isn't much, compared to the new worlds that would open up to you by learning a major language such as English, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin, or many others.  Esperantists claim this would change  - if more people spoke Esperanto, more works would be produced in it, but even if that were true it would mean that most people would see little practical result from learning the language for decades, and then only if everyone else really were learning it, too. \r\n \r\nCertainly, it has its advantages, and the article I cited below talks about some of them.  In the end, though, I doubt it would actually achieve most of the results that its supporters seem to think it would, and it would be a pretty expensive experiment to try.          \nI've seen this video before. In fact I've read much of Claude Pirons work and he really does have a handle on the linguistic problems that are faced in the world. If you really want an eye opener with regards to language problems, read his works detailing his time as a translator at the UN. This is where you really get to understand how other languages manage to grind the weak and less used languages under their heels. If you really disagree with that, I suggest you read his stuff. It's very compelling. \r\n \r\n\u011cis! \r\n \r\nPS: Igor, I owe you an apology. I meant to hit thumbs up but hit thumbs down by mistake. Please disregard.          \nHi, GPB ! \r\n \r\nI can tell two cases which seem to suggest that you're mistaken. One is an Indian whom I saw after he had ceased speaking Esperanto for 18 years. He lived in a small town somewhere in the center of India where he was the only speaker of the language, and he couldn't afford to travel. He happened to be sent to Europe and I met him in Geneva, Switzerland, where he contacted me. For the first 30 minutes he was quite shy, and found it difficult to express himself, but the more he spoke, the more the language came back and after two hours he spoke fluently. We spoke Esperanto every day for a whole week, and it was as easy for both of us as if it had been our mother tongue. \r\nThe other case is a Pole I met in New York, where I was working at the time. He had participated in an Esperanto youth organization, but he had left it long ago and didn't believe in the language anymore. Somehow when we met I mentioned the language, and just for fun he asked me a question in Esperanto, telling me he had completely forgotten how to speak it. But I went on speaking Esperanto, and after maybe fifteen minutes he started being able to express most of his ideas. He was extremely surprised himself, since he had quit using the language 25 years before. After one hour or so he spoke fluently.  \r\nMy experience is that such a rapid return of a forgotten tongue does not happen with other languages. I guess it can be explained by the extreme regularity, consistency, exceptionlessness of Esperanto. My own difficulties in English are always due to inconsistencies. For instance I don\u2019t know which syllable to stress in *alternative*, I say *costed* instead of *cost*, I don\u2019t remember if *cough* rhymes with *tough*, *though*, *through* or some other ough-word, I know that the adjectives I want when writing about astronomy exist, but I need a dictionary to retrieve them, because I cannot make up *solar* from *sun* or *stellar* from *star*, just as I cannot form *dentist* from *tooth*, *disarmament* from *weapon*, or *colt* from *horse*. None of these problems exists in Esperanto. The whole structure of the language supports you, and helps you find the form you need.  \r\nSo I think you should check your opinion about Esperanto being lost after a period of non-use against reality. At times, what seems logical at first sight may be disproved (or is it *disproven*?) by experience.          \nHello, \r\n \r\nThis answer deals with a number of points brought up by GPB. \r\n \r\n1. Comparing the \"recallability\" of any language and particularly English to Esperanto is like comparing integral calculus to simple addition. Unless you are a genius, learning calculus requires real work and remembering it years later would certainly be difficult. On the other hand, simple addition comes naturally. The same goes for Esperanto. You really have to check it out before you assume similar levels of difficulty. \r\n \r\n2. By saying that people have to go to conferences held in English, we may conclude that 94% of humanity are confronted with a dominant (foreign) language. Some people, generally the other 6%, respond by saying that a dominant language is a fact of life. Given the past several thousand years, they do have history on their side, but does that make the situation fair, equitable or desirable? I think not, particularly when a large (a few million) group of people have made a major effort to create, develop and promote an effective solution whose whole idea is to level the playing field and give everyone an equal chance, while reducing the overall workload for us all (I know many English-speaking people who have learned Esperanto very quickly). \r\n \r\n3. Concerning the cultural question, you are right, the culture of Esperanto is similar to that of a small country and would take time to develop even under the best of conditions. I will simply say that quantifying/qualifying different cultures is most tricky. \r\nBut do not forget that Esperanto provides very easy access to all cultures and it is truly gratifying during an Esperanto conference to be able to walk up to any of thousands (literally) of people from dozens of countries and start talking on an equal footing. \r\n \r\n4. Concerning the results already achieved by the language, that would require a long discussion, but for anyone interested, there are more than enough sites in virtually all languages that present the current status of Esperanto. \r\n \r\n5. As for the cost of teaching Esperanto, have you looked at the cost of teaching English ? And the results ? Having taught English, French and Esperanto, I can say from personal experience that people (particularly children) learn Esperanto much faster, much easier and, most important, the end result is far superior. By that, I mean that they can understand and express themselves better after 200 hours of lessons (two school years @ three hours per week) than they probably ever will in English or French. Unless of course they move out of their country. \r\n \r\nAnother aspect is that training in English in school requires such effort that time is drawn from training for the mother tongue (that is the situation in France) and virtually no time is left for other languages. Given that English is the first foreign language (96% in France, mandatory in Germany) taught, we are caught in a funnel, headed toward a \"just English\" situation in international communication. That is neither fair nor cost effective. And loss of diversity is certainly not a good thing either. \r\n \r\nSo, for what it is worth, there you have a few remarks. \r\n \r\nLook forward to hearing from you. \r\n \r\nF. Bartsch \r\nbartsch@bartsch.fr          \nYes I watched it recently and have just re-watched it.  He certainly proves his point about English, whether intentionally or not by the mistakes which he makes!  I gave up counting them.  I have heard him in Esperanto and I certainly was not distracted by mistakes - a little by the accent maybe - but I could concentrate on what he was saying and the brilliant style and expressiveness he used in saying it.          \nHe knows much about international communication and language problems - both from the viewpoint of a translator - interpreter and the psychological one. I think he is very logical and convincing.          \nI watched the video and I think the translator hit the nail on the \r\nhead. \r\nKurt Fischer \r\nBreslauer Str. 15 \r\nDE - 63927 Buergstadt \r\nGermany          \nI think we need Esperanto as the internacional language!          \nL'ho visto. Pi\u00f9 volte. \r\nIneccepibile! \r\nCongratulazioni all'autore. \r\nLa questione \u00e8 geopolitica. \r\nChi \u00e8 uomo di stato - non un politicastro - non pu\u00f2 pi\u00f9 eludere il problema.          \nGreat stuff. Now we need something to explain why Esperanto hasn't already become a first foreign language for the world. Is it because it's too good to be believed without seeing? Or is it, as with many good ideas, because of interventions by people with vested interests?          \nI watched the video and I'm sure Claude Piron is right. Esperanto is the only way forward for all people living in the European community with so many languages a real Tower of Ba'bel. It cost 5 minutes of political courage to decide to teach Esperanto in the elementary schools. What's keeping our politicians from doing so!          \nI watched it several times.  It seems to be a very honest and informative presentation, worthy to be viewed by people of all ages and interests.          \nLearning and using Esperanto is a fantastic experience. First, you can learn it in a fraction of the time it takes to learn most other languages. Many people start using Esperanto within a couple of weeks after their first contact with the language. Of course, they make many mistakes ... but still, they are easily understood. And they understand what they read. \r\n \r\nEsperanto is not going to stop people from learning other languages. Many people that learned Esperanto went on learning other languages. Once that you have the experience that you can communicate with people using a language other than your native, you start wanting to learn other languages. After all ... I learned English after I learned Esperanto. \r\n \r\nYou may start to enjoy Esperanto by visiting my homepage at   and following some of its many links. Please write to me if you have any questions. My e-mail address is in all my pages. Just click the word, \r\n \r\nEnrique \r\n \r\n \r\nFremont, California, USA          \nJes, I watched it twice and I entirely agree! \r\nEsperanto is easy to learn and is a very good tool for communication and travel. \r\nJust try it: http://www.lernu.net          \nThe video packs an amazing amount of relevant information into just 8 minutes, yet gets the idea across clearly.

Why do you think he is so messed up in the first place. Show him some love once in a while and we all wouldn't be going through this.          \nNo. \r\nHe's sick. \r\nThis shooting was just a cry for help. \r\nHe was just as much a victim in this as Sarah Palin.          \nYes, and his last meal should be his copy of the Communist Manifesto force fed to him          \nThis is the REAL focal point of this tragic incident NOT \"innocent till proven guilty\"---because there's overbearing evidence, including video of the rampage, proving Jared Loughner IS guilty of murder. \r\n \r\nIt's a given that Loughner will present himself to the court as \"insane\"; it's his best and only defense aimed at his best case scenario: life incarceration in a mental facility--much like John Hinkley got. \r\n \r\nBut Hinkley did NOT kill anybody....Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz did, who also tried the insanity defense; he got natural life incarceration in a prison.  Logical doubts exist Loughner will get incarcerated in a mental hospital. \r\n \r\nSo it comes down to two scenario options: Natural life in prison or death penalty execution. \r\n \r\nAnd given the evidence shows Loughner PLANNED in detail his assassination of one single person-- that target being Congresswoman Giffords---the plan evidently went awry, causing a free will shooting rampage that killed nine people---including a 9 year old girl and a Arizona Federal Judge, odds DO lean towards death penalty for Loughner.   \r\n \r\nWhy is simple: Pre-meditation is evident---doesn't matter how animal wild \"insane\" Loughner chooses to present himself on his court date w/ the judge. Loughner could set a precedent---and march to his death by legal court order execution as an \"insane\" man.          \nI'll bet money he never goes to trial, he's 'insane'.........          \nThat is an excellent question.  Arizona does have the death penalty and has executed a total of 22 people since 1976.  Surely this was a premeditated act of multiple murder so I would think it is a death penalty case. \r\n \r\nWhether this individual is mentally ill or not, if ever there was someone who deserved it it would be this gentleman.    \r\n \r\nFor Any parent the hardest thing ever imaginable is losing a child and to see the parents and loved ones of that beautiful 8 year old girl who was killed suffer is so sad, not to mention the others who lost their lives and were injured.          \nHopefully your brain will get the death penalty, for the good of America.          \nSome people stupidly rushed to the judgment that he was right wing. Then it came out that he was actually apolitical and the fact that Giffords' district was on Sarah Palin's list of targets was a coincidence. How do you get from there to the idea he was left-wing? \r\n \r\nThere are actually people we all find reprehensible. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean that your political opponents agree with them. For example, I like puppies and kittens. Do you like puppies and kittens? I'll bet you do. See, there are some things that liberals and conservatives actually agree on. Among them, the guy who shot the Democratic congresswoman and killed 6 others including a little girl was crazy and the events were terrible.          \nThe leftists will turn him into a victim and then try to punish everyone else with gun control.          \n6          \nNah you see its similar to a situation I found myself in a few years ago. The year was 1357 and WW2 had just been declared, I found myself in space with nothing but a club soda and a nutella sandwich. I had to fight my way through 14 waves of U.S. congressmen to get to the end of space itself which in those days was called the republic of Georgia. I had gone 1775443 lightyears with no food, but folks were stronger back in those dyas. I was leading the Stalingrad defense later that night \r\n \r\nBut the magic turnip was never seen again \r\n \r\nI hope this helps          \nI doubt it the  libs will say the gun is at fault and the man had a boo hoo childhood          \nI think it should be the death penalty. I think he needs the chair or maybe Obama can hire Michael Vick to execute him.          \nI can't predict the future. If I could, I sure as hell wouldn't be on here.

Then two guys got out and started chasing me.. I ran... I remember that there was a sort of bridge that I jumped off of.. there was a construction zone below.. I landed on a huge pile of sand.. so I kept running..

The sky was a ghastly green and very cloudy. I was taking out the trash, and a big beige van pulled up in the parking lot. A white man with all black clothing and sunglasses grabbed me and tied me up and threw me in the back seat and then drove off. I remember him beating me and me crying. Then it flashed to me being in the hospital, and him saying he was my dad or something. I then started screaming at the nurse and told her he'd beat me... when she ran out her started beating me some more. It was so incredibly scary. It's a dream I'll never forget.          \nok this is weird and awesome but i had a dream that Chris Brown had me in his bed and was giving it to me! \r\nyummy!          \nMy worst dreams are the one with my dad in them.  My dad was a drug abuser and alcoholic, a very verbally abusive alcoholic.  Well, I've had about four dreams about him, and in ever dream, he's trying to kill me.  I remember one where he held me and my mom hostage in our house (my parents are divorced, I live with mom) and he decided to let me go.  As I was walking down the sidewalk, he came out with a gun and shot me in the shoulder, and I did the little spin-thing they do in moveis.  When I hit the ground is when I woke up.  I would have to say that was the worst one of the four.  There was also a dream where he took my mom away with a rope around her neck, that was pretty horrific - got my heartbeat going!

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130122082252AABVdZA", "answer": "\nMy experience is that exactly the opposite is the case.  Shop bought bread contains preservatives and that is why bread in the shop today will have a use by date at least 5 days ahead of today's date. \r\n \r\nHome made bread does not have the preservatives (I would not know what to add to preserve it) and does not keep even into a third day (unless frozen).  When I make my own bread I make small loaves or bread rolls and ensure that I have an empty shelf in my freezer so it can be frozen in small batches for future use.  It's too much work and takes up too much space whilst rising to want to do that every day.          \nI work with a lot of Senior Citizens and in my experience there is really no difference between the home made bread and store bought bread. it is usually the temperature of the dwelling which is the biggest contributing factor. I leave most of my bread in the freezer and will take it out the night before and toast it in the mornings. Most of the people I work with either have a bread bin or just leave it out. the temperature of the home is usually so high in some of these peoples homes is that the bread will dry and then go moldy quickly. I know some elderly people who have their thermostat so high that the wall paper starts to burn and peel off the walls. ha ha          \nIt's made with 'Sensitive wheat',that can't take criticism?          \nDid you mean to ask this the opposite way round because the opposite is how it actually is?  Home made bread is far better for us but goes off quickly unless kept in the fridge or freezer.  Manufactured bread has things added to make it keep.  Some shop bought breads are guaranteed to keep fresh for a full week.  \r\n \r\nI have made my own bread for very many years (but not all of it).  I know how to make it by hand and I have a bread maker which I use just occasionally.  When I'm in the mood to make some I make a large batch - keep some out to use, freeze some and give some to a relative with the instruction to use by tomorrow at the latest.  It is usually eaten quickly though because it is so very nice.          \nIt doesn't.  Shop bought bread is loaded with preservatives to make it last longer.          \nI do not think that is true Thomas... Most of those store bought have additives & preservatives.  However, the small shop bakery breads do not and have a tendency to spoil if not used soon just like home made.          \nIf you freeze each slice individually - a loaf lasts for ages.  Straight out of freezer into toaster.  Works fine. \r\n \r\nMo          \nMy homemade loaves go off so quickly Thomas that I only make them when I know the rest of the family are visiting so they can help to polish them off. \n \nAs others have mentioned the bought bread both white and brown loaves are packed with preservatives so much so that it  just daren't go off..))          \nAs your famous seventeenth-century poet observed, lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.  \r\n \r\nThe chemicals that are put into commercial bread to make it squishier and therefore more appealing to ignorant consumers at the supermarket are so noxious that when they eventually lose their brief, intended effect, the bread winds up tasting nastier than if it had simply gone stale in the old fashioned way. \r\n \r\nAmong the poisons commonly used in commercial bread are: \r\n \r\nBleached flour has been stripped of its nutritive value. \r\n \r\nHydrogenated oils. Well known poisons that cause heart disease. \r\n \r\nHigh-fructose corn syrup. A well known poison that causes diabetes. \r\n \r\nAzocarbonamide. An industrial compound used in the manufacture of plastics. It causes asthma. \r\n \r\nPotassium bromate. A carcinogen that also causes hormone imbalances. \r\n \r\nPropionic acid. Which has been found to cause autistic behavior in laboratory animals. \r\n \r\nAnd L-cysteine. A non-essential amino acid that is usually harvested from human hair. Most of the hair comes from barbershop floors in China.          \nIt's not a secret that many stores, including many big national chain businesses, cheat on the sell by date.  If the store bought bread goes off too early, it could mean it's already not very fresh when you first bought it even though it could indicated it was freshly made.  It's very easy to change the sell by date. \n \nOther than preservatives, whether we'd touched the bread with our clean or dirty hands and utensils also matters.          \nDon't know the answer to that one, but I have been very suspicious of the oatnut bread by Orowheat here in the USA. It seems it never shows signs of mold or becoming stale! Wonder what type chemicals are in that! I'm speaking of a loaf more than two weeks old!          \nI believe these so called loaves of \"fresh-bread\" are anything but fresh my friend.  It,s my opinion most of our \" daily-bread \" is prepared and stored long before reaching any retailers.          \nI have never had shop bought bread go off easily.  Home made does though but it's far nicer. \r\n \r\nI make occasionally, when in the mood but I buy large sliced loaves and take 4 slices out of it and freeze the rest.  It is very easy to take another 4 slices out by just tapping the loaf on the worktop. The slices separate easily then and thaw very quickly. \r\n \r\nI usually have 2 slices of toast after my breakfast porridge and then have 2 sandwiches at lunch time.  If I didn't freeze the remainder of the loaf it would be slightly stale by the end of the week but would not have gone mouldy - just rather dry.          \nGraybear has a good answer.          \nI supposed it is \"planned obsolescence\" but I really do not know, as I have been baking my own bread ever since my then wife refused to do so in the early 1960s. I bake two loaves, and put one in the fre\u00e9zer. The first one I take a week to get through (I now live alone) and is still fresh at the end of that period.. Then I defrost the second loaf which then lasts just as long. My ingredients are yeast (fresh, whenever I can get it), wholemeal wheaten flour, a little salt, and water from the tap, which is this area is quite hard. I line the bread pans with butter to stop the loaves sticking to the sides of the pan, so I suppose a tiny amount of butter gets into the flour. Sometimes the very end of a loaf gets a little hard; in that case I soke it in my soup or chili-con-carne when I next have a dish of either.          \nthat's odd because i think it's the other way round. when i make my own bread, with no additives, i must use it that day or the next or it will go hard but shop bought bread will usually keep for four or five days. must be all the stuff they put in it!          \nShop bread is usually steam cooked so is over moist and can go off very quickly whereas home bread is baked and therefore a little dryer so appears not to last so long.Thats what I think.          \ni think its to do with the wrappiing, most shop bought bread comes in plastic bags in the u/k, so when you open it then re/seal it, it traps fresh air inside the bag which then reacts with the moisture in the bread and causes mould, which usually starts with the tell tale little green spots, which then turns to the green fur coat, i prefer bread wrapped in the grease proofed paper,[WARBURTONS] it usually lasts 5/6 days, then starts to go crusty, so its then toast time.          \nMy bread is made with organic products.  It always lasts a week.  It's kept in a bread bin. \r\n \r\nShop bought bread isn't supposed to go off.  I shall have to buy some and see how long it lasts under the same conditions. \r\n \r\nThomas you might be interested in my link in connection with this subject. \r\n \r\n \r\n          \nWe find that supermarket bread goes off or mouldy in only a day or two even if we buy from the so-called better ones.It is often already on the shelves with what looks like condensation inside the wrappers which smacks of having come out of a cold-store & this could certainly be why it goes off so quickly. \r\n \r\nAs we have a very good local bakery at the end of our street where we live now we tend to buy our bread from there.It is baked freshly twice a day,can be cut on the premises to any thickness you want it to be & last for days longer than supermarket loaves.Their cakes are sublime too. \r\n \r\nThe loaves are a little dearer but the exquiste taste more than makes up for that & it smells like bread used to smell.Even the crusts taste good. \r\n \r\nThe gigantic flour tankers cause a road blockage when they deliver but it is worth the hassle to have the end product to enjoy.

Also, just because one is bisexual does not mean that they are willingly open to anyone for a three way that includes both genders nor that they are willing to date more than one person at a time. I personally don't find it wrong when my partner finds someone else pleasing in their eyes (let's be realistic, will you only ever think and feel that your partner is the only one that is attractive when in a relationship?), but I do find it problematic when they start associating with anyone to get something out of it or if they shame me about by comparing me with others. Checking someone out does not make one a \"slut\" nor should she be shamed or valued less for being more sexually active (although I don't think someone her age should do such activities, but I'm not going to police her on her choices nor do I care much). Being myself and not caring for the gender or looks of my partner, I could relate in a way. Including having my experience of dating individuals whom were bisexual. I could care less of their sexual orientation and whom they're \"more sexual opened to\" as you had put it.          \nWell, I can tell you two things about this: \n \n1. Based on what I know so far about difference between heterosexual men and bi-sexual women is that a hetero man probably has not idea of the aggressiveness that bi-sexual women will develop if she is denied opportunity to have a woman. The best way to think about it is as one of your hetero guy friends, who has been denied a girl, and ask, \"What would he do? How desperate will be become?\" A bi-sexual woman will exhibit same behaviors, which includes looking at naked hetero women in the locker-room. It is important to understand this, because if you think of her as a chick who happens like like chicks every now and then, you might be surprised at what she does. Also, many bi-sexual women are promiscuous. It's not so much their fault. The same physiological process that makes them bi-sexual also drives them to seek out sex, and since they need it from both men and women (if they are truly bi and not lesbian pretending to be bi), that's roughly twice the activity. \n \n2. Her desire to have a guy or a girl will change according to her hormone patterns. Sometimes she will want a guy, and feel like traditional woman. Sometimes she will want a guy with girl nearby. Sometimes she will want a girl, and the idea of guy being around when she has the girl will be gross. \n \nP.S. -  \n \nI asked a question recently about bi-sexual or lesbian women checking out straight women in locker-room, as it would make logical sense. I think this is very wrong, and is a violation of the privacy of those being watched. It is not very much different than a doctor checking out his naked patient while examining her - you are in the presence of someone where there is an implicit expectation that you are not being checked-out by that person, but that is what is occurring, so it is a violation. Here is my question: \n \n \n \nJust keep in mind - she is *not* heterosexual, and appreciate that.

She also said that she LIKES one of her best friends... She has a reputation as a slut but once I got to know her she wasn't really a slut until this happened. What should I do about the situation because I'm really not that comfortable with her checking chicks out.

Now when I go to cut a pesky little low hanging branch I can barely lift the same chainsaw. I also used to clean out a chimney stack. But there's no way now I'm getting up onto the roof and I no longer like ladders and heights.          \nI'm still very ambitious, but I lack the stamina to accomplish my ambitions.  This is something of a daily crisis for me, and I can't figure out what to do about it.  It can be quite depressing.          \nI still can do most things, my biggest problem is getting onto my knees and trying to get back up!          \nI was at the doctor's office today and there was a little girl sitting across from me. I watched as she bent over and worked on her feet and toes and I thought about how I had been able bend that way, once. Now I get dizzy just getting up on a chair, if I can make it onto the chair, and look up at the ceiling fan to see if the switch is turned to summer. I can't get outside now with the heat, but I wonder if I'll still be able to get out once the temperature cools.          \nI do okay if I don't have to get down on my knees and back up again or stoop for very long. \r\n \r\nI own a dustpan on a stick.  I have a knee pad and a stool for getting up again if I must kneel down in my garden.  I used to bend over an mop my bathroom floor.  Now I toss the damp cloth on the floor and swoosh it around with my barefoot.  I don't like those Swiffer mops. \r\n \r\nHave you tried doing things in small steps?  This has helped me a lot.  If I were to paint a room, (several months ago) it took me a whole week.  I could work at it for about an hour and that was it.  Primed, then color paint walls, then corners, then the trim.  My son did the ceiling for me first.  (Bless his little heart). \r\n \r\nI gotta admit.  I'm not into do-it-your-self as I used to be.          \nI am only 53 but have felt like I was going to die several years ago. I think it is good I went through that cause I learned that many things that seem to take over the body just need to be worked on. I really stayed in bed sick for many years. So I had to get my health back on my own. With low energy and not being able to think I found that if I noticed my breathing I started to think better. If I ate certain foods such as those that have protein I could think better. If I drank water.So I changed all of these things and I am still working on improving.  \r\n \r\nThere is so much info. we can use but we have been taught to put our faith in the drug companies, doctors who work for the drug companies and religious institutions that make us feel healty but if we pay close attention they are actually filling us with fear not faith.  \r\n \r\nI started riding a stationary bike every night during Jeopardy but for the first year I couldn't stay on for a minute. I mean I really came from nothing to this recovery. I am still very much in recovey though.  \r\n \r\nI couldn't lift my arms without pain to wash my hair so my body really became weak. Now I exercise some then add more to what I do. I noticed I couldn't bend over or easily get up from the floor so those are things to add to a rountine.  \r\n \r\nWhatever someone finds the can't do they need to make into an exercise. If you can't pick up a 20 lb. chain saw find something in your house that weighs that much and put it in your bathroom. Everytime you go take a tinkle it will remind you to lift it up a couple times then after doing that for a week do it more and add more.  \r\n \r\nI thought I was a victim and I still have a lot of that going on. I just found out something bad about someone who won't listen so I have to focus on what I know about not fixing others. So I am working at all of this but I know the alternative is not better.          \nI have a room that needs painting and have not painted a room for 10 years, so we shall see just how easy or not it is.

I'm not a senior, though...          \nAbsolutely!  Or I would forget what I really need.          \nI do.The list keeps me from making expensive impulse purchases.          \nWe make  lists, not because we think we will forget everything --but because we know that we will forget at least one item, if we don't. \r\n \r\nPS : In supermarkets, why can't women think, and push shopping trolleys sensibly , at the same time ?.          \nI very seldom make a list since I will end up leaving it at home any way.  I'm one of those people who would forget their head if it wasn't attached.          \nI always have a shopping list going. I keep a narrow pad of paper attached to my refrigerator by a magnet; and add things to my shopping list as I notice that I'm running low. When my children still lived at home the rule was if it isn't on the list, then mom would not buy it (this 'rule' still holds for my husband). I find that if I write down my list and review it, then I remember to get what I need even when I forget my list.  \r\n \r\nI do 'improvise' with my food shopping; shop partly from my list and partly by whim. I first go to either a Farmer's Market or produce market; and pick out fruit, veggies, cheese, and eggs that look the freshest and cost the least. Then I shop for things to go with the fruit and veggies.  \r\n \r\nFor me, it isn't shopping from my list that prevents me from over-spending; my trick is to eat before I shop. Shopping while hungry has caused me to load up on snacks and other items that I don't need...;)          \nYes, I do Lily and without it, I do over buy. It leaves me feeling as though I am forgetting something important if I leave the list. So, I try to remember to always take the list which is more sensible than the things I buy on a whim.          \nI have always made a list for supermarket shopping.   Simply because I find those places so boring.  I just want to get in and out as quick as possible so I can go do some real shopping.   A list lets me go straight to the aisles I need to then get right back out. \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nI always make a list and stick to it, very rarely buying anything not on the list. \r\n \r\nThe supermarkets hate customers like me as a lot of their profits come from impulse buying.          \nI make a list and only buy what on my list..I always put my list right on top of my purse and when ready to leave I put that list in my jeans pockets so it is with me at all times..but sometime I will lose my list while I am at the store though..only once in awhile will I buy something that is not on my list, if I see something cute to buy for my grandsons that is..=).          \nI make lists for everything...or would spend my time backtracking all the day....or coming home having forgotten something.     \n \nBecause I try to save $$ any way possible....I will usually map out how I am going to run my \"route\" to accomplish the things on my list before I leave the house. \n \nYes,  my shopping list is subject to change if I run into a great markdown item...or unadvertised store special. \n \nPS.   Was just reading through my list for today...and noticed I nearly forgot one item on it....To wish everyone in the Seniors Section...Happy Valentine Day!!    Without my list,  I would have forgotten to do it...          \nBeing on a budget, I plan menus for a couple weeks at a time, making sure to either use or freeze leftovers later.  I've got a list on the refrigerator so I don't forget items which are in need of restocking. The stores LOVE it when people don't make lists and they have all sorts of expensive goodies in every aisle to entice.          \nI attended a seminar when I was about to retire and the one thing I remember was always write things down,so yes, we make a shopping list,needless to say we sometimes forget it. I am the best for shopping if given a list I buy what is on it and that is that,my wife goes down every aisle in the super market.          \nI keep a list handy and add to it when I think of something,I do a lot of projects around the house so I also make a list when I need something from the hardware store.          \nYes--- \nwithout a list I would remember around 3  out of 20 things I need . \n  \nI write things down in groups of where they are and stuff in front of the store on top and the bottom of the list is for items in the back of the store. \n \nHowever, I also buy stuff not on my list, especially when I am hungry  ;-)          \noh yes, i have notes for every-thing pinned all over the place, although i do my shopping online i make a list just the same. ive got so bad ive even stuck a note on my fridge reminding me to clean it !!!!!!!          \nNo. I hate making lists. I just walk slowly down the aisles and pick whatever I need.          \nI only have a list for those items I absolutely have to remember to replenish. All others I pick up I try to get \"on sale\" or \"discounted\". I have even gone so far as to only buy those meats that have been reduced in price because they are close to their best by dates, or those that are on at good sale prices to draw customers....when you are feeding 7 people--all of whom are big meat eaters--it can get very expensive otherwise!          \nHi Lily. Yes, I make out a list before grocery shopping. Otherwise, like you, I will spend more. Sometimes even with a list, I see something I failed to put down, that I know I need. I also make my list out by the grocery sale bill, and take advantage of those sale items, IF I need them.          \nI Always write out a shopping list to do my weekly grocery shop.  If I didn't I wouldn't remember half the things I wanted. \r\nI have a terrible memory and even write down 2 or 3 things like bread, milk, papers.          \nI write a shopping list. \r\n \r\nI write a menu plan for the week too.          \nA shopping list is imperative to me. I don't like to spend time wandering about deciding what to eat for the next week. Since I can no longer drive, I try very hard to keep my pet food stocked.I keep my pantry stocked with all the things I may need for the weeks food preparation. The essentials such as paper towels, toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, whatever else. \r\n \r\nIt was because I do that I did not find myself with hungry pets, or a meatloaf I couldn't finish making because I didn't have all the ingredients during our brief \"lock down\" due to weather. \r\n \r\nI sure admire the people who live for instance in North Dakota  who know how to maintain their larder!          \nI make a list, jotting down stuff over the weeks time,  then if it's long,  I rewrite it putting things in sections like the grocery store.   Otherwise,  I'd still forget half of it!     Probably one of the main things that keeps me making the same foods over and over.   I can't remember to put new ingrediants on the list.   Let alone buy them! \r\n \r\nI'm able to steer my shopping cart ok,   but when the guy asks me 'plastic or paper',  I never hear him.   I'm so busy trying to remember what I forgot!   \r\nHappy Valentines Day to you too Ms. Minerva!  And everyone.          \nI do use a list.  We live 15 miles from the stores.  If I forget to buy something I need, it's a lot of gas to go back to the store for it.Can't depend on my memory these days.   Also, without a list, I buy several things I don't need.          \nYes...I like to take inventory of what I already have and then check my coupons...then 'map' out my meal plan for the week, then make the list accordingly... \r\n \r\n..helps to keep me from accidentally over spending or buying stuff I already have.          \nWe tend to list first & then embellish while strolling down aisles.          \nThroughout one day I am making a shopping list for the next day.  I go shopping for just a few things each day because I don't drive and cannot carry too much weight.  As I think about something we are running short of I just jot it down.  The next morning I look at my list and decide which ones I need for that day (and considering the weight of the items) then decide what can be left for tomorrow or ever later. \r\n \r\nSometimes I forget my list and leave in on the kitchen table but, because I went to the effort of writing it down, I usually remember them because the action of writing seems to leave an imprint on my brain .  That function of my brain isn't quite as good as it used to be though.  I used to have a list of maybe 16 to 20 items and would still remember them (if I forgot the list) and in the same order than they were written on the paper.  I could see the list in my mind - if you know what I mean.   \r\nOh, those were the days.  I think 5 items is about my limit now. \r\n \r\nAs I age I am becoming more careful in what I buy.  I use up left-overs (hate throwing ANY food away) and have become very inventive in using up small amounts of several things - adding something fresh if necessary to stretch the bits into a meal. \r\n \r\nI buy bulk when there are really good offers on but have to rely on a friend or relative with a car to do that. I have enough storage space to take whole cases of cans or jars if necessary and that can save a lot of money.          \ni usually make a list of things I need and mustnt forget \r\nthen i usually walk out of the house without it          \nYes, when I go shopping for my wife she always has a list made out.  The strange thing about it is I often come home to find I had forgotten something on the list.  I take a pen with me so I can scratch off the items as I place them in the cart but I still find a way to forget something.  Isn't becoming elderly fun and challenging?  :o)          ", "question": "\n    or do you buy whatever takes your fancy at the time? \r\n \r\nI usually make a list of sorts but I invariably forget it and have to buy on a whim or what I feel needs replenishing in the cupboards. \r\n \r\nI also find that I spend more without my list and in these lean times I could well do with remembering it. \r\n \r\nSo do you need or bother with a shopping list?

As long Yankee fans aren't totally and completely disrespectful to me, I'm fine with them. But if they go beyond the \"Red Sox suck\" insults, I get a little annoyed and defend my team. Otherwise, I've had conversations with Yankee fans numerous times at Fenway Park and they were (mostly) all very classy and polite. \r\n \r\nEdit: People throw out ridiculous insults online because they're behind a computer screen. They have time to plan what they're going to say and come up with clever comebacks. I bet that 90% of the kids on Y!A wouldn't say the things they type to someone's face. They feel safe because they know that they'll never meet anyone they're conversing with on Y!A. I don't know about you, but I find that a bit pathetic. I know there's a saying that goes, \"If you wouldn't write it and sign it, don't say it.\" Well, I think in the online world, it's the other way around.          \nfight and insult the yankee fans....i respect all other fans though \r\n...in response to your additional details there are ALOT of fights at yankees sox games dont know what games you go to/what teams you watch          \nI try to be as courteous as possible, but there's a limit to my kindness.  I'm not gonna sit their and let some little punk talk crap about my team without joining in.  For the most part, I haven't had many problems, but there have been a few altercations.  The most notable being between me and my friends, and some Indian fans.  All I'm going to say is there was more than a couple bloody noses. =] \r\n \r\nBut aside from a couple times, I've had some pretty decent conversations with fans from other teams.  In San Diego, it's pretty much like this:  Padres Fans, Red Sox Fans, and Yankee Fans.  I've had pleasant conversations with most of them and they actually proved out to be quite knowledgeable. \r\n \r\nEDIT:  Wooh! The first thumb down!  Hopefully, the first of many more!          \nTreat all fans with respect. This nonsense can get out of hand and WE all must remember not to have our athletic events - pro and amateur - degenerate into soccer \"riots\" reported on in many spots throughout the world.          \nYou had your face on the big screen? LOL LOL you are toooo funny,and brave.I really treat the rival's that come to yankee stadium pretty good,i just like to go to the games and have fun.          \nFlush them down the toilet see if they enjoy it          \nI'm a San Diego Padres fan our rivals are the Dodgers. those dodger fans love to fight, always talking crap when were there to see a game (giants, rockies, & d-back fan not as much). the funny thing is if you go to Chargers games, those same dodger fan are raider fans & they talk even more crap & they love to fight even more (Bronco & Chief fans not as more too). we don't treat them bad, it just they love to fight, & we San Diego people don't take crap from anyone, so why don't you guys go back to L.A. & stay there!          \nNot much though I've never gotten tiks to a SSox game living in NY.However many friends are Yankee fans so there are more heated arguments there for instance \r\n \r\nFriend: Hey Boston su+ks \r\n \r\nMe: Yeah we do suck. hey whatday are the WS Rings coming in.  \r\n \r\nF: Yeah whatever Yanks rock (yeah right) \r\n \r\nM: Yeah by the way asjk Jeter hoe the golf courses are in October \r\n \r\nF: Yeah 26 rings \r\n \r\nM: What have they done lately \r\n \r\nF: Luck \r\n \r\nM: Yeah cuz luck always beats a roidfiled 350million dollar lineup \r\n \r\nF: Wait til next yr \r\n \r\nM: Yeah I can watch another WS win \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHowever for strangers its not further than a Yanks suck. And liek some have said there are intelligent.          \nI really don't treat other fans rude because my mom, who's very strict, is there. If I was there with just my friends than I would go loose. As a Yankees fan I believe that Sox fans take it over the top when it comes to treating other team fans. U got balls to do that stuff.          \nI've been to several different ballparks.  With the exception of Phili the home fans treated the visitors with the same respect the visitors showed.  Once in Baltimore I actually saw an Oriole fan catch a foul ball.  He was an older man.  He then turned around and handed it to a little girl wearing a Red Sox cap.  Class like that isn't typical.  But usually it's almost never physical or rude. \r\nNow a friend of mine lives in Oakland and has Raider tickets.  According to him.  It's enemy colors.  And those people tend to get beer spilled on them and sometimes even completely ignored by the vendors.          \nnot livin` in the US anymore but i`d love to kick some dodger`s asses at AT&T when i see some dirty scenes on youtube          \nThe same way they would treat me, if I was in the rival team's ballpark.          \nWith respect.          \nnice question. \r\nlol im a yankee fan and have atteneded red sox games. \r\nunless they come out of their face and make a stupid comment about the yankees which one fan did, its pretty fun you hear guys screaming go back to beantown get some clam chow-da imitating a boston accent. i think it depends on how you act. \r\nbut i respect them until like one fan who looked up at the above crowd and said hey yankees suck. \r\nhe had bottles and stuff thrown at him.  \r\n \r\n-you have got some guts dude. my friend was trying to get me to go to shea wearing my a-rod jersey and boo the mets but thats disrespectful. \r\n \r\ngo yankees!  \r\np.s. keep going to sox games in yankee blue          \nI make it a point to be respectful -- I would want to be treated that way if I went to a visiting ballpark.          \nI liek to ask them questions. They probably think I'm weird---hey, I'm a weird guy, I don't deny it! I just ask them questions on their team that take opinions. We always seem to get stuck by Tigers fans. When I was at The Cell vd. the Orioles in 2006, there were some Tigers fans there for some odd reason. But they were very polite and I liked them. I have a lot of relatives from Michigan so I see Tigers fans a lot. Plus, they are baseball fans and came to support their team. Why get mad?          \nI have been in Angels Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Yankee Stadium, Petco Park and whatever the name is of that sauna in Miami in Red Sox gear.  Everyone treats you with respect/ignores you, except the Yankee fans.  There is just too much history there.  It makes it fun.   \r\nAs for your experience, I could never understand why a Yankee fan would show up at Fenway for  a Red Sox--Tigers game in Yankee gear.  Wear Tiger gear for Heaven's sake.  Of course you are going to be the most loathed person in the park.   \r\nActually wearing a Yankee hat in the City of Boston is not the brightest of moves as a general matter.          \nwell I don't get upset with people unless they they argue with me and don't know what they are talking about. I don't mind talking or even arguing with fans from the opposing team as long as the are knowlegable baseball fans, and aren't rude. I would much rather talk with one of my fellow Phillies fans.          \ni let them enjoy the game until they become idiots. i travel to games but respect that i am an outsider, i don't get in faces when my team does well or wins. i hate when fans come into your team's house & get stupid & when they do, they get knocked down a notch.          \nI only went to one game to see the Red Sox at Fenway, and the only \"rival\" I saw near was my dad, and he was wearing a Mets jersey, when the Red Sox were playing the A's. So, I was nice to him...seeing as that he was my ride home, and I wanted some cotton candy. Haha.          \ni hate when them da.mn mets fans invade philly, theyre rude, lazy and obnoxious. at a game last year a mets fan proposed to his girlfriend and they showed it up on the bigscreen at citizens bank park, then all of a sudden the entire stadium started to boo them.          \nI think it depends... As a Braves fan, I don't remember seeing a lot of crap when I did get to go to games.  I noticed that people just let the other fans do their thing. \r\n \r\nI've found that living up north, it's a little more brutal.          \nEverytime I go to Tampax Park in San Francisco wearing my blue hat, I get stuff thrown at me (mostly because the Dodgers usually win) because Giants fans are among the most pathetic and classless I've ever seen. I guess it's tough having an empty trophy case. When I'm in Los Angeles, there are hardly ever any Giants fans there, so there's no point. Maybe they don't want to drive 450 miles south just to watch their team lose. Can't blame them.          \nI treat them as nice and polite as possible unless there Dodger fans then I might not be as friendly...Haha          \nI don't harass anyone who cheers for the other team in my teams Stadium. I hope to get the same courtesy & respect when i go to Fenway park & Wrigley Field later this year.

I lived in Boston for a number of years, and have been to a bunch of games at Fenway (currently my second favorite ballpark).  Being a Yankees fan, I often wore my Yankees hat (and sometimes even a jersey - Mattingly, Jeter, or Ruth) to games, even when the Sox were not playing the Yankees.  Call me crazy, but that's how I roll (and I am not the only one).  Of course, I get booed, and people would make comments (i.e., \"Yankees suck\" or \"Hey guy, did you take a wrong turn on I-95?\").

Its just simply none of your business it doesn&#x27;t affect you in any way so seriously if you don&#x27;t have anything nice to say dont say it! I&#x27;m bisexual and 100% proud! Am I going to hell?

Think what you want I have an amazing heart I don&#x27;t steal I volunteer I help people any way I can I didn&#x27;t choose to be this way I just am and if I&#x27;m going to hell for loving the love of my life then so be it IDC its my life don&#x27;t worry if I do or not be worried if your going to hell for judging people and trying to be god! Just stop with your homophobia!          \nWell first of all, I support gay marriage and have nothing against gay people. But that's not the issue here. \nYou ask me should gay people serve time for sinning. So I assume we establish the idea that homosexuality is bad. The question then is how bad is it. \n \nWell, why is it bad in the first place? Is it because it's unnatural, because the Bible or another religious book forbids it or because of another reason? \nI'll consider these in that order. \n \n1) It is bad because it is unnatural \nFact: there is no gay gene. There can't be one after hundreds and millions and millions of years of evolution. Scientists look for a way how DNA is 'expressed' (let's leave all the genetical stuff out of this) for the source of homosexuality. \nAnother fact is that you are not born gay. There is an easy proof of this (and it is directly related to the first issue of the 'gay gene'), which is the experiment with identical twins. This study has been carried out since the beginning of the 90s and is done over and over again with the same results. When looking at identical twins, a small percentage (~10%) has different sexual preferences. By that I mean that one is gay and the other is straight. \nIf you are born gay or straight, that percentage shouldn't be there. But it is. This means that some lifestyles and upbringings of children are more likely to 'induce' (if that is the right word) homosexuality. \nBut these are not the only facts. Homosexual intercourse is seen in the wild when looking at mammals. Primates, buffalo's, bats you name it. These participate in homosexual intercourse whenever they feel like it. There are many reasons for this, but it's almost never because they are gay (mistake the partner for female, desire for sex or whatever). These animals are actually bisexual and not gay. \n \nSo gayness is a disorder that is present in almost all mammals. It's uncommon, but not something that is only seen when looking at humans. This makes the argument of unnaturalness rather weak, if you ask me. But I leave it up to you how to interpret this. But even if there is a biological reason that gayness is unnatural, that doesn't mean it is bad. A Bose-Einstein condensate is not seen in nature, yet we can create one in laboratories using lasers to cool atoms. Lasers are based on stimulated emission through population inversion of the electrons. That's also unnatural but that doesn't mean it's unethical. \n \nCombining ethics with biology easily becomes a national socialist thing, so I would like to leave it at this. My conclusion is that homosexuality is bad because it's unnatural is just not that such a strong argument. \n \n2) Because the Bible forbids it (or any other religious book) \nI'm gonna go ahead and say you live in the USA. The treaty of Tripoli states very clearly that the US government is not based on any religion (and Christianity in particular). If you live in any other country, the argument usually still holds. All western countries are secular, meaning that religion has no law giving or enforcing power. It does not mean that religion as an institution is illegal, it means that the government does not practice religion and does not use it in the profession of its labours. \nActually, most of Western civilization is based on Napoleonic laws. \nThe highest law is thus that of the country, not that of religion. But if we say that you live in a non-secular country (Pakistan, Iran, Egypt) where religion does have lawful power, any punishment on homosexuality should be as described in the scriptures that religion is based on. Does it say death by stoning? Then stone them to death. Does it say '20 dollar fine'? A 20 dollar fine it is. \nSo prison is not suitable solution here either. But because gay people are still people, you might consider a more humane approach. In that case, prison is a way to go. \n \nSo that is what the arguments are build on. If the first argument (that of unnatural behaviour) still holds for you, I would consider a punishment such as sterilization. They act unnatural so they must be sterilized. But since gayness has little genetical basis and more psychological basis, imprisonment in a mental institution seems more appropiate to me. \n \nIf the second argument works for you, I would say that the punishment given should be the one as given by the scripture.

I would be calling the teacher to discuss and if you can't solve it, talk to the principal.          \nThe push to raise funds is the culprit. I would see this teachers immediate superior and report this behavior because it puts undue stress on a child's life.          \nlife isnt fair gramps. i thought all your knowledge and wisdom as an elder would have made you realise that          \nYou can put the fake names down if you want as long as those names produce the money needed for your grandaughter to turn in at school.That is not fair. I think it should be on a volunteer basis only. I would probably call the school to complain.          \nI almost fell into that trap, but I used a better name \r\n \r\nMr. Nowonz Gonapae \r\n \r\nI sure would find out from the Principals office what this is about.Who knows, it might be something for just the Teacher.There is nothing more useless and expensive than Magazine Subscriptions!              Good Luck!          \nif that is what the teacher meant, no it isn't fair--my granddaughter told me the same thing and come to find out she misunderstood what the teacher meant--her teacher meant name, address, telephone no etc. (whatever the info called for ) because these were magazine subscriptions and not food\\item orders.          \nfirst i would ascertain that the details are correct -- if so - i would give the form back to the teacher and tell her to put it where the sun does not shine -- then i would make an apporintment with the school board and inquire if they knew what was going on in there school -- i also would explain to the grand daugher exactly what was going on and i would also make it up to her for being brave and backing my actions!!!          \nThat's real pressure on your granddaughter, and I would be going to see the Head never mind the teacher. Its not on at all.          \nHi ol'geezer, \r\n \r\nPersonally I'd go to the school principal & or superintendent of schools & have a  discussion with him/her about sending children door to door in today's society to sell magazines, gift wrap, candy, pizza's or any other kinda fund-raiser's.    Ask what gives the teacher the right to demand this of your granddaughter then punish her for not getting any orders.  What are the school policies  If the school wants money that bad hold a school event where parents donate their time, have a brazzar, bake sale,  donate unused items from home for an auction, like a carnival-cake walks, fishing pond, bean bag throw, eat dinner at the school function using tickets with allot amounts, sell used books cheap,  ice cream social, dunk tank for the teacher's & principal. \r\nNo I find this objectionable to say the least. Good luck & have a good  day. :0) \r\nAdditional Details: had children in school,  have grandchildren, get involved, support  the school. Ban all fund-raiser's.          \nI would contact the teacher to ensure that what you heard was what the teacher intended. If not, no harm just a simple request for additional info. If the teacher affirms that your grand-daughter is correct, then I'd be making some complaints-to the Principal of the school, to the Superintendent of the school district, and to the members of the school board. If the teacher didn't return my attempts to reach her or him, then I'd complain to the Prinicipal and work my way up the food chain if needed. \r\n \r\nSchools, and after school programs (like Little League or dance schools) can be relentless with their fundraising efforts. I always set a limit on how much I'll 'donate' each year and stick to it, no matter what. I've only complained once, in a situation similar to what you are dealing with....and the teacher 'changed her tune' about kids who don't sell a specified amount for her chorus not getting to participate in a fun activity.          \nyou lot above !!...its fund raising...dont be soooooo mean !!!.................................and you lot below !!          \nThat is blackmailing your grandchildand you, that is outrageous, it should be illegal to do that, unless you are to fill it out ONLY if you intend to purchase the mags..Take it to the school board, the principle, call child protective services about it, call the police, write a letter to the editor, call your local TV news station.  Get a lawyer as a last result.          \nTell the kid to just say \"NO\" to all dealers.          \nThat is not only unfair it is totally inappropriate. I just send them back the same day with a note that my son and I do not solicit friends and family.          \nYet another reason my kid was homeschooled.  The public school systems fails to account for the fact that some kids are in public school because it's the only option available to the family...if they could afford to buy magazines and chocolate at $2 a bar for a $1 candy bar, the kid would probably be in private school. \r\n \r\nWhen my older children were in public school, I remember the tears they shed because they couldn't sell whatever the latest fund-raising item was ... we lived in the ghetto as it was the only rent we could afford at the time and every other kid in the neighborhood was pushing the same product. \r\n \r\nI agree with whomever posted, just say \"NO\" to all pushers.          \ntake your mop when you go....just make sure your granddaughter heard it right first.          \nExtortion          \nFund raisers should always be voluntary. How sad for children who's families can't afford to contribute to be punished. This is not fair and the principal should be informed. The teacher in this case is in the wrong.          \nI would go have a serious talk with the teacher, the principle and the Superintendant.  I would be pissed off big time.  They would not do that to my child! I would go to hell and back before it was over with.          \nI have bought subscriptions from my grandchildren many different times.  Each time the child received a reward. \r\nThere was never a threat involved.          \nIt's not fair - but know this ..sometimes kids come home and say anything in order to \"compete\" . If you complain at school , you may find out that your little darling embellished  the story a little , in order to sell the most - OR - you will succeed in bringing negative attention to your  grand daughter .  \r\n   If , in fact teacher did say something like that - kids misinterpret a lot anyhow - so give her the benefit of the doubt .It can't be easy with some 30 kids in one room all day ..and it's probably for a good cause . The kid wants to look good in front of her peers . Sometimes trying to help - we can make them look bad .          \nGet this straightened out ASAP..Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding on someones part. \r\n \r\nI'll like to know how this turns out if possible.          \nSometimes, facts get a little mixed up on their way home... Just so the teacher was aware that the child wasn't making up excuses, I'd send a note back with the child stating that he/she wouldn't be participating ------------ if indeed there is any further mention of punishment, I'd be at the school raising royal conniption fits.          \nThe only ones who win from this charade are the magazines.  They USE kids to peddle their junk then give them trashy 'prizes.'  I'd have that teacher up against the wall and tell HER to go hustle magazines. \r\nI remember when we were given these magazines to sell.  I threw mine in the trash the first time.  I didn't feel bad about not selling ANY subscriptions.  What a RIP OFF.  I thought the schools had dropped that nonsense by now.  But, stupid is  as stupid does.  \r\nYou do realize that in most fund raisers, the recipient only gets 5% to 15% of the funds raised? \r\nAsk the teacher how much the school gets out of every dollar taken in.  Does the teacher even KNOW?  Probably not. \r\nSounds like someone needs to attend some PTA meetings and make their voice heard.          \nI'm sure as I can be, you love you're grand daughter. In you're mind, everything that comes out of her mouth is gospel. But,,, the best of kids,, don't always tell the truth... Don't mean to lead anyone to think , there's not some  brain dead teachers .... Talking to that teacher seems like a good idea.. If that don't do it,,, the Mickey Mouse thingie sounds good... THEN   See what the school board thinks.........          \nConfront the teacher directly with a question, an open-ended question, one which the teacher can't answer with a \"yes or no\". For example: What happens if my child couldn't find a relative or friend to order a magazine?  \r\nIf this is the case and the teacher has threatened the child's recess, then a trip to the Principal's office is warranted. \r\nI just so happened to contact the school 2 of my Grandchildren attend. The parents filled out the magazine forms for both children. While talking to the Principal, she informed me that she doesn't like the magazine fundraiser because the school will see very little of the funds. She told me she feels the fundraiser is a rip off. I asked her why the classroom teacher was participating then, but she didn't have an answer. \r\nChildren cannot be forced to fill out these forms or return them.  \r\nI have destroyed countless order forms and envelopes that my Grandchildren brought home.  \r\nThe representative of the company usually sells the children at an Assembly-so the children come home revved up, ready to sell-for the cheap $store prize. I generally just donate a check to the child's school for a worthwhile project.  \r\nOf course, you don't have to do that either. I would rather just give a check than receive worthless or overpriced fundraising items.          \nGood for you.......That's something I would have done. \r\n \r\nDamned if I'd let the fund-raising nazis intimidate me or my child/grandchild. \r\n \r\nIf they want to raise money, have a bake sale.

I'd then run up and quickly beginning stomping on his a few times. I'd kneel down over him with my knees keeping his arms pinned down and beat him in the face. After long time, he'd be less resistant and struggle less and this would probably take a while. If no one pulled me off of him then I would choke the guy until he was unconscious.

Some people describe the Atlantic Ocean as \"just across the pond\".          \nBigger lakes could be much more dangerous than many areas of the ocean - particularly shallow ones.  But that is a gross generalisation. It comes down to the location, and the conditions at the time.  If your man has enough experience to be cautious, you should be fine.   \r\n \r\nMake sure the boat is well found, and that you have phone and radio communications working at all times - if you can talk to and be heard by Coastguard and similar marine services at all times you will be informed of any bad weather or hazards, and are only a shout from help should anything unfortunate occur. \r\n \r\nGood luck, and long life to both of you!          \nThere are two problems to consider: \r\n1. Navigation, it is not uncommon for the inexperienced boater to get lost at sea because they can not navigate by chart and compass. It only take a little in attention to loose sight of land and fog (or squalls) can come in quickly making line of sight navigation impossible. \r\n2. It is an ocean, and as a result the waves can be much bigger. Over confidence in a boat will kill and those who do not respect the sea, die at sea. As others have said \"The ocean is a tough mistress and none can tame her!\" \r\nIt would be best to charter a boat for a short cruise so that you have some one who is experienced with the waters at the helm.          \nSomething else that wasn't mentioned are the large swells. I once took my lake style boat onto the ocean in Key West. My biggest problems were the swells. I was constantly speeding up and slowing down going over the swells. But if you have a ocean worthy boat they should be able to cut through these swells. Otherwise stay within sight of land and you shouldn't have a problem.          \nGood luck . If you go out you might want to get one of them things that call the coastguard when you get lost or the boat won't go home for you . They are nice to have . So if your fiance can't \"tame the wild ocean waters\" you turn it on and the coastguard will come and get you . And you don't have to tell him you have it . Better then a phone .          \nCaptain Ron sound like a some 1 that U can get U into trouble real quick. Best watch the weather.Tame the sea. Mother nature will show him some new tricks. Stay in shore and close to land beside the sunsets in the west and the mountains will block it.          \nto keep this a stress free honeymoon, suggest that you go out in chartered fishing boat. this will also give you a much better chance to catch fish. \r\n \r\nhere is a site that lists boat rentals and charters in Oregon \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nthere are lots of bay, rivers and lakes, in OR,  that you can boating on with out the problems that can occur in the ocean. \r\n \r\nhope this helps          \nNight and day,the sea is very more dangerous with a high chance you will die, you need training, and why don't you ask the coast guard, why don't they patrol lakes as-well as the sea.why do landlubbers treat the sea with no respect          \nBig difference! \r\nAnyone that thinks they can \"tame the ocean\" is in for some big trouble, and a very fast change of attitude.          \nThe vital factor that came in my thoughts when I saw this stand was 'rust'. A bowrider probably can manage the sea if you choose your times but the salt-water will easily impact anything on the vessel that is not corrosion - evidence.

Same brand names and there's no big line to stand in.          \nSometimes and for certain things I do, I tend to not trust food items in these stores but they are great for things like toiletries and garbage bags, sandwich bags cleaning supplies etc. I shop second hand stores for clothing and kitchen things sometimes as well.          \nI do have a look see about once per fortnight, Lily. \r\nCharity shops will find me in their DVD shelves \r\nlooking for odd gems that I cannot find elsewhere. \r\n \r\nPoundshops can be handy too, I sometimes purchase \r\ndomestic cleaning products there, and the odd book \r\nor two, though as they only stock remainders in books \r\nI do not often find much that I would wish to read. \r\n \r\nThey also stock things like 28 packs of enteric coated Aspirin \r\nwhich are cheaper than the pharmacies. \r\nEven bought some dahlia tubers last year and they were a \r\nlovely bright show. I often find myself saying to people, \r\n\"Oh, I got it at the Poundshop\", no need to feel any \r\nembarrassment in this economic climate.!          \nOften, and more and more each month. \r\nI live in a town of 2,000 people and we have 2 of them. \r\nThere's some great deals to be had.          \nI buy most of my clothing from charity shops also other odds and ends and these shops are really cheap and the quality is good.          \nYes I do.  We now have 5 charity shops in our little town.  I recently got a set of pyrex casserole dishes (4 sizes plus the table stand) for 5 pounds. They have a lovely sunflower design on them and were still in the box.  It looked like they had been a wedding present that had just never been used.  I also got 3 Gucci ties for my son for 2 pounds each.   \r\n \r\nAlso, given the poor quality of some of the new clothes in the shops in the UK these days I would rather have a good quality 2nd hand  garment that a new one that goes out of shape after the first wash. \r\n \r\nI also buy more groceries and wine from stores like Lidl and Aldi than I used to.    \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nI visit them regularly. \r\n \r\nWe do a lot of entertaining and there's a continuous breakage of glassware, cos we serve up a glass of port or sherry often and the glasses get broken, so I'm always popping in to one of the Thrift Stores, on the look-out for some nice looking cheap small wine glasses.  \r\n \r\nWhile I'm there I always check out the used clothing section, on the look-out for waistcoats (my favourite collection...)          \nI check out the dollar store about once a month when I go to the used book store because they are in the same plaza.          \nYes i do my dear          \nYes, I buy many of my clothes, as well as books, and kitchen items from Goodwill stores, which sells used donated clothes, and other items.  I think more and moe people are doing so, because I have noticed that  their prices have gone up lately.  I see absolutely no reason why good used items should not be recycled and the proceeds used for a good cause.          \nAll the time....They are my favorite kind of stores.          \nI love faith based thrift stores.During my first layoff I found some great buys on golf equipment. \r\n \r\nNow on my second layoff I found a wonderful buy on a necktie for interview purposes.I also donate kitchen items that I don't use to these stores for resale.I like to help others as I have been helped during these tough economic times.          \n99 shops.          \nI like shopping local, & b/c all of the area dollar stores are chain stores, I rarely visit them.  And when I do, I look only at a few things--as most of the stuff in the dollar store is of junk quality.  I'll buy potpourri & scented oil, but not much more. \r\nThe thrift stores are a lot better.  They have a variety of stuff of much better quality--the junk stuff has long since broken. All my clothing is second-hand.  My shoes are all brand-new.          \nI do go to dollar stores sometimes but you have to be careful because they are not always the cheapest on many items or the quality is not as good.          \nI go to a Dollar Tree about once a month, sometimes more to buy certain items that are lower-priced than Wal-mart's similar items.  Our local thrift stores have been very busy during the past 3 years, used to practically have some of those stores to myself during week-day mornings (right after I retired) but now they are  buzzing with customers, so bargains are getting harder to find.          \nMy missus is very shrifty!, with \"her \"money?, say no more Tom, or you might get into trouble.......          \nNot so much the charity shops, but I often buy stuff from the pound shops.   \r\n \r\nThey sell gardening gloves, the kind with the palm grip, for \u00a31 obviously, and they are great for my hubby's work.  If he bought them from the builder's merchants they would be 3 or 4 times that price, and they last just as long.          \nI go to dollar stores regularly, to pick up certain items, which are cheaper than big stores.  Lately, however, I have been trying to do research on their food items, just out of curiosity. \r\n \r\nOne thing about ground coffee, that I have found.   It's pretty good and only a dollar for a good sized bag.  Turns out the coffee is from Viet Nam.  Little did I know that Viet Nam is the second largest coffee exporter, next to Brazil.          \nI enjoy browsing in these sorts of shops, don't always buy something but it is fun to look around. \nIn Hungary, we go to the swap meet, or boot sale held every weekend in the city park. \nSome very interesting old things there, hats,old fur coats and boot leg DVD's. It is exciting when the police come in a sometimes raid the bootleggers, we watch from afar, cheap thrills. \nI have found a few nice items in one of the large second hand stores in Budapest, the prices over all on used clothing is much cheaper in the US at the Goodwill stores. \nI think the VAT is added into the prices overseas and it is getting harder to find good deals on used clothing there. \nI noticed for a new sweater at the H&M stores it was about $40. a used H&M sweater \nat the thrift store was $20. and used up looking, they are getting to greedy over in Hungary on their used items. \nWe have just stocked up on 99 cent items here in the US, small things that will travel well in my suitcase, reading glasses, aspirin bottles and such. \nI just gave the Goodwill store a huge bag of used clothing, it's nice to recycle things that no longer fit or are being used. \nMy husband is the one that saves allot of money on his second hand purchases. \nHe has been working on 2 cars for our son, he has picked up very new parts some slightly used and saved at least $1,000 or more just in the past month \nHe uses the internet for days sometimes and scouts out the best prices even for new car parts. \nSince he is now retired, he has more time then money where as in the past he had money and no time. \nHe is trying to teach our son how to save by doing for himself and making sure he does maintenance on everything he owns.He is the biggest bargin hunter I know. \nI was trying to get him to buy himself a few pairs of new jeans, he loves wearing Lee brand black jeans. He has several pairs, still in good shape only problem is black fades over time in the wash. \nHe had me buy a bottle of fabric dye, going to try it out on a couple of pairs before purchasing some new pairs,a little time and a couple of dollars could save us $100. or so on jeans. \nHope they come out looking new or at least newer.          \nYes, yes I do.          \nCertainly, I called in the poundstore yesterday to buy a large pack of white envelopes....\u00a31 for 80          \nMore, now that I'm retired.  The dollar stores for certain items, but you have to be on the lookout for quality.  Some things are just too cheaply made.  The area charity store is huge and I have found some very wonderful things in there at dirt cheap prices.  That is where I have brought home 2 stainless steel pans and decided I loved them so much, I had to buy a new cookware set.   I love them.          \nDefinitely, things are getting so expensive now you have to look around for cheaper prices. I always go into the pound shops, rather pay a pound for goods than what the supermarkets are charging for the same product.          \nAll the time,I'm still mourning the loss of NETTO.          \nAh... We called them thrift stores.  It is odd that more & more of them are also cropping up here too. \r\nAlso the swap meets or flea markets have more & more people looking & buying.  Mankind has returned to the traditional ways of shopping.  I do not enjoy shopping but I find a wide variety of used books for fair prices.          \nNo, but I always look around before I spend money.  At my age I no longer need to buy clothes, shoes, and things for the house and yard.  Most of my shopping is over the internet.          \nYes - we go into the dollar stores now and then.          \nI visit them regularly.

Everything has been good for my husband and me since we became seniors.          \nI don't like old bag.          \nNah, at 63, it's true, I am a senior citizen.  So much is untrue and held out as truth that I'm tickled at truth.  I've not quite gotten my head completely around it, so fast as life goes, in those perspective moments when things behind are so easy to recall.  Then, all I have to do is see another pretty woman in her twenties, her face in the news or one modeling in her slim body, to remember being there.  It's all good, all of it.          \nI happened to see Merlin's answer and I agree it's a badge of honor. What I hate is when somebody calls me \"Momma\"!  yuck yuck yuck, I am not your momma, nor would I own up to it if I were.          \nI don't mind but usually the word senior suffices.          \ni dont care what they call me as long as they call me in time for supper   :}          \nAt 55 it never has bothered me.          \nAs they say \"call me what you want, but don't call me late for supper !\". \r\nI will go along with anything as long as it isn't meant in disrespect.  Senior or sir is fine with me.          \nNot in the least!  Although,  I do want all the senior 'discounts' that come with that title!  lol! \r\nI only have to look at my reflection to see the gray hair and wrinkles, take my teeth out or visit with my children or grandchildren to know I cannot escape my age anymore.

If my memory serves me right, you had a photo on here a long time ago and you weren't ugly. I could be mistaken, but I thought you had a photo on here..          \nI've never personally been called a SC to my face & I don't refer to people as a SC either. People are people & they're either younger than me, my age, or older than me, plain & simple. When I was a youngster, I remember hearing my parents refer to people as an older man or an older woman. I grew up referring to them in the same way. How others refer to those much older than them, should do so with respect.          \nIt is better than being called \"old fart\" or '\"Geriatric\".          \nNope love it, cause I earned it along with every gray hair and wrinkle.66 and lovin life          \nI can still remember the first time I was called a senior citizen.

I ache too much to run get fat when I sit and eat smaller portions. So if I get a discount on something why not appreciate the fact that something is in my favor.          \nI think you are are a sweet young guy. That's how you come across, so it's who you are. IMHO          \n70 is the new fifty.          \nI am 55 and am quite comfortable with being considered a \"senior citizen.\" The title I now hate is ..\"she's a widow at 55!\" The word, widow is my pet peeve at this time.          \nWell as it would be incorrect,I wouldn't be too happy. Senior Citizen is a term used by governments and the public in general to folk who have retired or are drawing an age related  pension. When I was 50.I was addressed as I was at 40,forename,or surname,among others. \r\nI am now a senior citizen,but if someone wished to stop me and maybe ask a question,there are better ways than 'excuse me senior citizen,can you..'          \nI don't mind being called a senior I just mind looking like it.

If you are over 50 and one of these, what would you rather be called?  I respond to \"older,\" \"elderly,\" even \"geezer.\"  (Sometimes.)

Right now, you're still too young to apply for any Government programs.  As for social activities, wow, there are so many things you can get involved in!  Decide what interests you, then join.  Most Senior centers want you to be 60 or over.  There are many living communities for people 55 and over that have fantastic social calendars.  Your best bet is to look into what's available for seniors in your area.  Good luck, and have fun; you're life is really just starting!          \nOther than the AARP, I don't think u would qualify for anything else yet...You have to be atleast 62 I think... Your not old!!  Old is..... over 70!!!          \nwow, Happy pre Birthday. Your turning 55 years young is a blessing. A.A.R.P. would probably be a good thing to have, however you know in the U.S. you're not really considered a senior til you've reached the age of 62 and even then there really aren't any benefits. I say enjoy life, take some time off and enjoy you. Go to Disney world with some of your friends or go on a cruise. You don't always need a boyfriend, sometimes a relationship can cause unecessary stress.          \nHAHA now you get to go to the movies for a senior rate, get your Dunkin Donuts at the senior rate, ride the bus at a senior rate. Take advantage of it all granny          \nYou are still a youngster!!!!  True you are no longer \"middle aged\" (who lives to 110?) but you are not over the hill. \r\nYes get an AARP card- You can get some pretty good discounts with it for any kind of insurance (car, life, etc), hotel/motel discounts, travel discounts, extra services at your bank, and restaurants. \r\nJust because you are 55 doesn't mean you have to live a senior lifestyle. You sound young so stay young. Use senior discounts when it is convenient or profitable to you. \r\nAs far as anything else, I think that is really all until you hit your early 60s then their is medicare, SSI, etc. \r\nBy the way, if you look as young as you sound don't be surprised if they ask for ID when you ask for a senior discount! \r\nEnjoy your birthday!          \nWhat is the most paramount of your needs, I think that should be a companion or relationship. I strongly advise you to look for a guy that you can love and trust for a friendship. Life is too wide to live it all alone. Think about this. You may contact me on my profile for further discussion(s). Good luck.          \nFirst of all stop referring to yourself as a \"Senior\" Get a life.  Your only as young as you feel, age is just a number.  You have so much to look forward to.  Start thinking positive.  If you change the way you think, things start to change.  Take some time out for yourself.  It's time you start pampering yourself.  You deserve it.  Look how you have made so many people happy by styling their hair.  Get a make over, and go on a cruise, I'm sure you will meet someone to fulfill your dreams.  Good Luck!          \nyour as old as you feel, but you need to call AARP and ask them why they didn't send you an enrollment form.. But it isen't free to join, you have to pay for the membership.. \r\n1year is 12.50 2years is 21.00 and 3 years is 29.50.. \r\n \r\nYeap, nothing in life is free.. \r\nBut you will get discounts and when you join, you will get news letters that will tell you where the discounts are.. Your really not a senior dear..  \r\n \r\nIt doesn't matter if your black, purple, white or red..

The shipbuilder knew very well how to build good ships. If he had been left alone, Vasa would have been a good ship. Unfortunately, the admiral interfered constantly, adding things (for instance, extra cannon) that made the ship top-heavy. After the sinking, the King and government tried to make the ship builder responsible, but he produced all these signed notes from the admiral, so it was the admiral who got into trouble. \n \nA Swedish researcher found the wreck in the 1950s, and she was raised in 1961.

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110614075517AALdmyX", "answer": "\nI didn't like school and don't miss it. Reading and writing make it a little more understanding as to it coming to the lessons of life. The schools today have to much power. They are their own entity and screw your thoughts.          \neducation is a tool you use it to uncover the truths of life          \nIt's taken 41 years to try to undo the brainwashing.          \nEducation is the key to success, it does not guarantee success, but it opens doors that will remained closed with out the qualifying degree.          \nLearning is good, education is good, schools do the best they can with what they have available.  Unfortunately, schools are somewhat similar to the one-size-fits-all hat.  Just right for a very small number of people, usable for a good portion of people, totally unusable for the rest.  The most important thing to keep in mind when trying to get an education is that only you can make it worth while.  I went to a public school with very overcrowded classrooms.  I went to local colleges.  I think I got an outstanding education!  It's what you make of it.          \nIf there is one thing that schools prepare you for that is very necessary in life, it is the ability to LEARN. You do not get anywhere in this life if you can not learn from it. As to what you learn in schools, let us say that it provides a very good base for what you need to learn from life--Maths for instance. Do you think you could go a day without needing some simple maths skills?  \r\n \r\nSchool also teaches us how to look below the surface of things and figure out what it really is that we are seeing....and that is a skill all of us need to get by in this world.  \r\n \r\nAnd who doesn't benefit from the ability to sound like an educated person? We are much more socially acceptable if we sound like we have some brains in our heads. \r\n \r\nSo I guess my answer to you is that they are equally important. School teaches us how to learn the things we need to learn from life. And gives us the tools to interpret what we learn in a logical manner.          \nI never liked it...I went because I had to.  As far as I'm concerned, past elementary school where I learned to reading, writing, basic math skills, how to deal with and accept authority figures who weren't my parents...I never learned anything I couldn't have learned by just living my life.  Which I why I never went to college...and I've made a decent living for myself in spite of that.  Admittedly though...higher education is a necessary evil nowadays...a every expensive one, I might add.          \nthe schools and education are not too bad but need some upgrading about things in life that are very important, like how does stock market work and investing, buying a house, getting loans for cars and homes, buying cars and such. all this stuff I learned on my own and would have been better to teach the young today about this stuff, so many people are ready to rip the young off when it comes to these things and if they were better educated this wouldn't happen. the problem is the parents, they do not raise their kids, just let them raise themselves and with both working don't want to be bothered, send of to bedroom or leave home along and this is when bad things happen, this did not happen in the olden days, sure there were a few bad apples but not like today \r\n  today education is very important ,when we were young there were so many factories that paid well and had lots of jobs , not like today where there is hardly none, so an education back than was not as important as today's is.          \nI have had college education but didn't actually pull the strings together until I was hands on the job doing what we were taught about in school.   \r\nThink allot of this education business has become just that a business with little regard to what the student will actually need when they get on the job.

We grow most of our summer vegetables and trade some at a farmer's market.I also buy free range eggs from a farm down the road.          \nIn these tough economic times stores have to earn my loyalty and two in the Metro Atlanta area have managed to do so.I do the bulk of my shopping at Kroger's for their excellent generics and Trader Joe's when I wish to reward myself with a treat. \r\n \r\nHowever for the cat's food and litter I go with Pet Smart.          \nHave a choice between 7 super markets, so we go for the best at each....          \nI do most grocery shopping in 1 store, but when needing any paperwares I do that at another store, only once in awhile we will go to a butcher, and that probably 3-4 times a year..it's just to bad when you can't shop under one roof and get everything you need at a bargain price though..it would save on gas prices!!..=)          \nno and have never shopped at one store. you have to shop at least 2 stores to get deals you need, for those who shop at only one will never get deals they could use, but some prefer to do that because they don't want to be bothered with all the travel, but most all i know do more than one.          \nI shop in different places.          \nNo.  \r\nBefore I learnt  to drive, my (now) ex and I would go shopping on Saturday morning. Strictly a two stop affair. One supermarket for food  and the other for booze and tobacco. \r\nAs soon as I got my driving licence, my husband said he preferred meat from the butchers, bread from the bakery, cheese from the cheese shop, vegetables from the market. Bless him!          \nAll under one roof at Morrisons.  I have very little time because I work full-time x          \nBetween the super market and street market          \ninside shopping now there's a novelty out here? nope everything bought in marketplace, besides lots of haggling goes on and one can enjoy a Macadamia tea whilst one is being dragged around by Xia. \r\nFor some items well one admits they get flown in as the local stalls just don't have what one needs.          \nI don't really 'do shopping' but on the occasions I go down town with the gaffer I would prefer to walk around,she shops mainly at Morrisons,personally I would buy everything from independent shops or the open market. Maybe that's why she hates me tagging along. \r\nBury,which is our next town seems popular,folk can park their car and go into the shopping centre and an open market attached,the town is just a glorified shopping centre now and I can't stand the place.          \nWith 4 stores in town we watch the specials & shop around. There are 2 Aldi stores near us too & get things there when close to one.          \nSince I can walk across the parking lot to a huge super market, this is where I shop.  We do have a Grocery Outlet store in town and I go there several times a year.  On a good day, I can find Sara Lee sour dough bread which is now priced at over $4.00 a loaf at most stores,  for 99 cents at this store.  They also carry brand shampoos, lotions, etc. at this discount store.          \nI got to one supermarket because they have a great selection and have everything  I need.  I simply don't have the time or desire to go to multiple stores.  I do agree with you though that a local butcher shop would have better cuts of meat however I don't have one in my neighbourhood and am not driving out of my way for it.          \nI get fruit from our near-enough-by local farmers. On that rare occasion that I want to cook fresh vegetables, I get them there too. Paper products, cleaning and grooming supplies from our Dollar Store. Deli and bakery from the grocer. Certain brands only, of frozen vegetables, and rarely a meat.          \nLily, I haven't seen a butcher shop in YEARS>.......many years!!! \r\n \r\nI do most of my shopping at our Super Wal Mart! \r\n \r\ni also go to Giant and Blooms...\"Blooms is expensive, but I like the quirky things I can find there\" \r\nI don't go to Bloom's very often!          \n2 roofs...          \nAt the moment i am buying most of my things at one place. This move has disrupted my shopping habits and places where I would usually go to shop.          \nI'm 52, and detest doing the food shopping.  Yes, I do it all under 1 roof.  Can't be bothered to faff about.          \nI live in  a rural area.  So,  I plan menus and make one hour long drive a month to major shopping.  I have a planned route.  I use three stores but I don't have to visit every one every month.  I make a list and stick to it.          \nMore or less I do, I go to Morrison's a big store near me, or Asda also quite near me and Lidl email's with their bargains.          \nOh for the days when there were butcher shops. I'm trying to remember the last butcher shop in our area. I don't know where you live,but I'd like to move there just to see another butcher shop. They have the meat section in the supermarket but the quality is lacking.          \nlI usually get most of it in the 'discount '  grocery store,   that I'm trying to keep in business now that Walmart has loomed.    But there are a very few things, they don't carry that I get in Walmart, or in the upscale grocery store in town.          \nNo.   Some of the stores have things I just can't live without that the others don't.  Then there are the speciality stores like Brennan's, featuring the best in vegatables, fruits, cheeses and spirits and imported goodies.

I was just thinking about buying a huge petrol-powered self-propelling brushcutter to keep the weeds down around the trees we're about to plant on a couple of acres.I'm 65 next month. \r\nIt's as well to remember that our reactions may be slower, and not take silly risks, but I'm not quite ready to give in yet.          \nMy dad refuses to stop mowing the grass and just turned 87 yesterday. He uses a push mower. My brother comes over to dad's and they share the mowing, dad doing the small front lawn, and my brother the larger area in the backyard. He isn't ready to give up his independence. There are times when he will cut it before my brother gets a chance to help him, but most times, they cut it together. When the heat gets to be too much, my brother does it all for him, but to dad, it is important to him to still remain active. Perhaps he is an exception to the rule at his age, but by staying active, it helps him to remain physically and mentally healthy. I think as long as a person is in decent health, and strong enough to do so, there is no reason to not, along with having safety in mind.          \nYou know that can be true..my Uncle was using the riding mower once and for the last time..he had a heart attack while mowing and fell off the mower and the mower ran over his arm and he died..there was no one around so it was too late..I think if they have someone around while mowing, it would be okay..but if the person would mow when it not so darn hot they would be okay..unfortunately it was toooo hot for my Uncle..=(          \nNot unless they feel they should stop. \r\nI'm 62,not careless, reckless, nor do I beat up my tools or get angry with machinery. \r\nI had to laugh at riding mowers; some of our husbands get carried away beefing up power.          \nThe elderly know when they can no longer mow the yard. If they have family they should be doing it for them anyway.          \nOh no ,not unless they are senile or crippled with athritis . Seniors probably have the most injuries as they are probably the highest amount of people to cut the grass. Do you see many young working people cut the grass many let it get so long they probably cut the grass once to a senior doing it 3 times in the same period. great excercise  just be careful.          \nI'm 55 and always push mow my lawn. I just take breaks whenever i feel too hot.          \nIMHO  statistics are always screwy!   Probably most lawn mowers are over a certain age?  Or something.   Forget the statistics.   Do it if you like it,   or don't if you don't.  You know you'll be careful.          \nMy Grandfather did his lawn until the summer before he passed. He was 94. I'm almost 63 and I still do it.          \nI drive a riding lawnmower but have stopped pushing the other lawnmower because of my back. A man comes over to help me each week cutting the grass. Poppy          \nNot necessarily all senior citizens should give up lawn mowing... I am over 60 years old and I am not incompetent nor dead yet... My health is good and I do not have any prescription medicines to take because I learned a long time ago to use common sense whenever I do things. \r\n \r\nMake sure you drink plenty of water at all times; especially before you mow your lawn during warmer weather. Do your lawn care during the cooler hours of your day... Don't be too proud to take breaks during your lawn care work... Pace your work carefully and take advantage of the good exercise that you get while doing your lawn care...          \ncall your local church they can get you in touch with some young chaps that may do the job much cheaper than the lawn service and yes i believe that if it is to much for you physically don't take the chance my grandfather had a stroke while mowing          \nWell, I love mowing my yard (3 acres) with my riding mower.  I gave up everything else, I just won't give up my mower.  Sorry.          \nyes, buy a goat, saves all the hassle.          \nI mow three acres and trim around the house.  I'm the only one that can do it and I'm going to be 75 this summer.  Somebody has to do it.  I can't afford to pay to have it cut cause Obama is taking all my pension and S.S. check away from me.          \nI would like nothing more but because of lack of extra money I must keep mowing my own lawn.  So far, knocking on wood, at well over 60 plus I have avoided injury accidents with push mowers.          \nThat is one nice thing about winter, my lawn is under a foot of snow          \nWe use to have a mower that pulled itself.  Very nice.  When we got close to 70 it got to be too much so we hired someone to do it for us.          \nI think it all depends on the condition of the mower and the condition of the mower!  The actual equipment needs to be easy enough to  use so that it doesn't cause a lot of stress on the person mowing.  The person mowing should be in good physical condition.  My mother in law is 81 and mows with her new riding mower and trims with a push mower.  She is in good physical shape and does a good job.  She also splits wood.  We can't be there all the time for her, and she refuses to live by us anywhere so not much we can do to help.  Ornery little woman!          \nI will never give up my lawn mowing! I enjoy working in my yard and my lawn mower is like my gun, you cannot take it without a fight.          \nwhy          \nI know many people 85 + still mowing their lawn. I mow several lawns. I suppose that would depend on the person, but if someone can't handle the lawn mower, then they shouldn't be driving a car.  \r\nGo for it Daisymae, You feel like you can do it.          \nI'm lucky because my son owns his own lawn care service and 2 of his guys keeps my lawn mowed, fertilized, leaves raked, etc.          \nEveryone should give up lawn mowing. God makes grass grow to the correct height, then it stops.  All mowing does is waste gas and pollute the air.   \r\n \r\nAny study from Senior dot COM is likely to be a bogus report designed to fool some guy's wife.          ", "question": "\n    \"Lawnmower injuries increase with age, with peaks in persons older than 59 years.\" The study of such accidents in 2004, found senior citizens 60 to 69 had the most push mover injuries and those 70 and older had the most riding mower injuries.

This (the income tax) is an element for it to spend out of control. \nGWB signed every spending bill to cross his desk. When he left office the national debt increased by around 9 trillion. I have no idea how most of that spending improved our lives but I can certainly see how the new record debt we set every day harms us. \nGov needs to make ends meet w/ the money we contribute as it demonstrates how easy it is to borrow. We're paying more in interest than most countries GNP. \nGov has abused the budget, it has stolen f/ the SS fund and it shows us how easy it is to spend someone elses money. \nMost of us are overtaxed but many of the largest corporations don't pay any.          \nI don't agree with you about the property taxes. You could have paid off your house and still be alive for another 20 - 30 years and to not have to pay taxes isn't fair, because you are still enjoying the services your community has to offer, including libraries and parks, and you grandchildren are going to the schools. BTW, I am a senior who lives exclusively on Social Security payments. I pay rent but a part of my rent goes to paying these taxes, too, through my landlord. That is as it should be.          \nYes and it's all pathetic too..=)          \nI am bothered more by how my tax dollar is spent.          \nProperty taxes are generally used to support continuing local public services such as police, fire, paramedic, schools, Many jurisdictions already give seniors a tax break for schools, since they don't use these anymore. But the rest you have to actually pay for, just like me and everyone else. The fact that you did not save enough money for your old age is not and should not be a taxpayer problem, so stop whining and get over it.          \nI agree with you 100%.          \nOh yeah! Same taxes everyone pays, and they are all outrageous!          \nFine, but hope you don't ever have to call the police or fire department, or use a library or take your dog for a walk in the park. I don't see why you should get a break from property taxes just because you're a senior. Maybe they could be lowered, but as long as you're living in your house, taxes should be paid to help pay for the services you use on a daily basis.

And no drivers licenses for illegals. With a drivers license they can register to vote. \r\nVoting is a right reserved for the citizens of this country only.          \nAbsolutely!          \nYes it does bother me because it is saying that the federal, state, county, and local governments are breaking the law by letting illegal immigrants vote. \r\n \r\nVoting is a right only for U.S. Citizens only and that is by law.  There is no \u201cspin\u2019 on this one.  If any lawyer or government official tells you otherwise then that person is lying and does not care about this country. \r\n \r\nAgain, illegal immigrants have no rights in this country until they get on line and request permission to enter this country legally. \r\n \r\nLet us do this to Mexico, Russia, or any other country as their illegal immigrants did to our country.  They would not like it also. \r\n          \nthe day they get the vote I will no longer go to the poles since it will no longer matter what the Americans want, of course they will vote for the one who can help them stay here, and give more hand outs,our country is in bad shape and can not support our own people          \nour govt knows this. that's why they make promises to illegals they know we united states citizens will fight to stop. i don't know what they can do. maybe they should start requesting id's and birth records when voting. it will upset U.S citizens. but we must do what we need to do to stop illegals. we need to make it harder on them so they will leave. they can take their anchor baby's with. company's who hire them should lose everything they have for hiring illegals.          \nIt bothers me a great deal. The fact that they are still here bothers me. The fact that our southern and northern borders still remain unsecured bothers me. This is a huge mess and needs to be cleaned up! Here again is just another instance where our government has failed \"we the people\". Absentee voting should only be allowed for people who are in the military or those that are American Citizens who are overseas for work, but you should have to prove it. There should be no same day registering and voting. These things need to be checked. I don't trust letting them vote and hoping that it will be caught later. That is nonsense. Trust the government to do anything right? Yeah, Right!          \nabsolutely.  I'm an independent, neither democrat or republican but I would like democrats to explain to me why they are voting for Obama when his tax plan will clearly hurt small business and favor corporations overseas.  I'd also like to know what democrats propose to do about illegal immigrants when our dollar is devalued as a result of this bail out bill and people in the U.S. struggle further for jobs.  Who do you think will be competing on the ground down here for work?            \nAs far as I know, only citizens can vote \r\n \r\nI have the feeling that those figures are totally wrong          \nIt concerns me that  David Simcox \"A REPUBLICAN\" would write such a thing! Is it that they are getting ready to lose the elections, and will want a recount because HE believes the illegals (whom are not eligible to vote) caused this sway? Hmmmmmm!          \nno          \nKitty Pilgrim: No photo ID is required. New Ohio voters have only to write down the last four digits of their Social Security number or write down their driver's license number. They can also register with the utility bill, cell phone bill, bank statement or paycheck, even college ID if those documents include name and address. Ohio Secretary of State, Democrat Jennifer Brunner, changed the rules on absentee voting by directive.  \r\nOhio State Rep. Larry Wolpert (R): There wasn't anything voted on. The General Assembly did not vote on this. The people's representatives did not vote on this. She issued a directive and said this is the way it's going to be. That's the reason why we had to sue in court.  \r\nPilgrim: The Republicans lost their suit against the rule in the Ohio Supreme Court. They charge the Democratic secretary of state changed the rules to usher in scores of new voters for presidential candidate Barack Obama. She denies the charge. The secretary of state's office estimates that a quarter of all votes cast in this election, more than a million and a half, will be absentee ballots.  \r\nPilgrim: Now Secretary of State Brunner's office today said there are safeguards for checking the registration of new voters. They're satisfied with the proof of identity requirements, but critics say election boards are unprepared to register and check this quantity of new voters just before an important election, Lou.  \r\nLou Dobbs: Has everybody lost their minds? There's no way for these volunteers to check that. I mean it's an absurdity. \r\n \r\nYeah just like they do in Ohio          \nYes. We can blame groups like democraps, liberals, communists, socialists, acorn, aztec, mexica movement, and la raza for these crimes. There are many more groups but the part I don't get is how we are letting them get away with it again.  If we stop these socialistic groups we may be able to get a handle on this issue. The sooner we get back to being 100% powered by capitalism the better off we will be. You earn your bread by the sweat of your brow and these poor illegals are being bribed with social programs, government stipends, and citizenship.

Its unfortunate that things are the way they are now but elderly people get taken too often. You could look on the net for volunteer opportunities in your area. You could volunteer at a senior center. You could volunteer at a nursing home to visit, read, play cards, call bingo games etc. That is something that is very needed, there are a lot of lonely people in nursing homes. I would stay out of peoples homes unless you go to work for an agency.          \nWhat a lovely person you are!  What a kind thing to want to do.

CJ          \nI haven't cleaned houses, but I have a service who has helpers who \r\ndo that for a living. There are home health care providers who work  \r\nwith state agencies like social services, who send out case workers \r\nto qualify seniors for in home care, or house cleaning, errand running \r\nand in general anything that can be helped with. I couldn't be without \r\nmy helper. And if she can't come on a particular day, they provide \r\na substitute. Today I had a woman sub, come and take down our \r\nlittle Christmas tree and pack everything away. She finished the \r\ndishes I had begun. She cleaned the bathroom, helped with the \r\nlaundry and helped move some clothes to my closet that were too \r\nheavy to carry without making many trips.

And they can assist if needed with bathing, dressing and \r\neven applying moisturing lotion on senior legs and feet. That is a \r\nheavenly experience.  There are many agencies that hire people \r\nto do these in home tasks. Many now require that their workers \r\ntake classes at the nearby college on first aid and helping seniors \r\nwith activities. This was an issue the public voted to approve in a \r\nrecent voting issue. Many states are requiring this as necessary \r\nto work in this capacity.

You have to have a gentle personality \r\nand be tolerant of the elderly, and the wish to make people have a \r\nbetter day than they would on their own and go without alot of \r\nthings.

When mould forms on the wardrobe clean it off, in DIY shops you can get a spray which removes mould and stops it from forming again for a while.          \nIf you have a local pound stretcher or store the same type you can get like wee crystal packs that draw damp to them and not your clothes....or give the inside of your wardrobe a fresh coat of paint or varnish... or in more extreme case's you could get a new or second hand wardrobe..          \nget a new wardrobe          \nCan only be caused by damp.  The fabric of the building must be defective in some way.   I  have had clothes in a wardrobe in my house for over 30 years and they are still OK.  Depends if you own the house or rent it.   If rented see the landlord.  He has an obligation to supply a dry watertight dwelling.          \nCase is here that the wardrobe is probabaly against an outside wall which is getting cold, the clothes in the wardrobe are not 100%dry, the temp drops below dew point , and you got moisture. First, move the wardrobe away from the wall, fet some Polystyrene sheet put that between the wardrobe and the walls.

If you're hungry eat some pudding or oatmeal. Think about how your even your teeth are going to look like.          \nIn less than a week the pain will go away. You'll barely notice that they're on. If they're digging into your cheek, get some wax and put it on the spiky bit. \r\n \r\nRemember to clean them thoroughly using interdental sticks, if you don't you'll get nasty stains.          \nI had braces for two years. I know it sucks and is miserable. I suggest eating Speggetio's for a few weeks, they don't need to be chewed and can taste good too. \r\n \r\nI suggest getting LOTS of wax so you don't cut your lips/cheeks...you will need it for a while and then you will get used to it. \r\n \r\nAlso try having asprin for the first week, it will give you sinus headaches and tension in your head and that will help. \r\n \r\nYou'll probably hear this alot (i did): But it may hurt now and suck, but in the long run you will have beautiful teeth. Make sure to keep up on whatever the ortho says...I didn't listen and ended up having them for six more months          \nI got my braces put on about two months ago and know exactly what you are talking about. You have to keep in mind the benefits of braces and that will help you to endure (at least it helps me). You have to also keep wax at all times, put the wax on were you feel sharp edges and take tylenol when the pain is unbearable.          \nUse Orthidontic Wax          \nha...oh the joys of braces.  \r\nI got braces for the same reason you did. My teeth were straight as well..my i didnt have an overbite...my teeth sat right on top of each other and it was wearing down my top front teeth so bad that they were really sensative! \r\nWell, worst case scenario, i got braces and the first couple days were horrid!! i got my braces on and didnt get to eat lunch that day, i came home and got home at 2:30 in the afternoon and tried to eat a hot pocket and my teeth were so sore i cried! I had a volleyball game that night (i was a Junior in high school when i got mine on). I played varsity and i played my best game that night (not that that had anything to do with it, just saying) and after about 3 days, the pain went away.  \r\nWhen you go to the orthodontist is hurts for about 1-3 days afterwards depending on what you have done. It sucks! I know it does!!!!! You will get through it and the pain will go away. I tried taking EVERYTHING to make my headaches and pain go away, nothing worked so i just had to stick it out! \r\nI got my braces off the day before my senior prom and my teeth looked great! \r\nI had so much damage to my two front teeth though that i had to get plastic veneers put on my front teeth. They look amazing!! I promise in the end, everything is worth it..the pain, the headaches, the embarrassment of eating and getting stuff in your braces...it sucks, but you will be 100% happy with your smile when you get them off! :)          \nUSE SOME ANBESOL! It works! \r\nI got braces 4 days ago and that was the first thing i got my mom to buy, \r\nIt comes in a gel or liquid! \r\n \r\nHope I helped!          \ni used paramol (liquid) bcuz panadol didnt work 4 me  \r\nye i thought braces were cool at first lol (&glasses) \r\nand try gargling with warm salt water...it helps a bit \r\nhope they stop hurting          ", "question": "\n    okay i just got my braces yesterday which i used to think they were really cool but now i hate them \r\ni cant bear the pain is to much ugh \r\nanyone plz tell me what i can do  \r\ni will highly appreciate  it  ", "title": "\n    How can you control the after getin braces?

I consider myself lucky - my hubby can't either. \r\n \r\nVery mild is good for me - almost bland. \r\n \r\nI do have a very sensitive stomach and can't take the heat. \r\nDeeJay          \nI thought that was really interesting, though my personal interest is 'academic' rather than practical, cos I can't eat chili peppers (acid reflux) though I truly love the taste and flavour. \r\n \r\nWe've been to Thailand a few times and you tend to need to learn real quick to say, 'Mai Pet..! Mai Sai Plik..!' which means 'NOT HOT..! NO CHILI Peppers..!' otherwise they serve you food which explodes in your mouth like a hand grenade..!  \r\n \r\nThe locals round these parts commonly nosh on street food and one favourite is Felafel, balls of chick-peas, deep fried and served in a pita-bread. They spread an evil-looking red paste made with chili peppers on it, called Suhug and that too is lethal..!  \r\n \r\nOne thing I do indulge in the a tiny addition of Tabasco and I like that cos I can moderate the exact amount of 'spicy' without it being dangerous. I also like it for another reason. The MacIlhenny Family donate serious sums to the USMC because one of their family was a famous marine general. I like then for that too.          \nNot hot. I like to experience flavors not suffer an endurance test. If I want to burn my tongue, I'll heat a fork on the stove and stick it in my mouth.          \nSorry to answer this question like a food snob,which I'm not.But in my opinion too much heat ruins the taste of food.I like spicy food but only if the peppers accentuate the flavor. \r\n \r\nBut I can take the heat.Give the hottest salsa anytime.          \nHmm - I have vague and somewhat nasty recollections - of sticking my head down a toilet bowl and then standing open-mouthed - under a cold shower - for a full 30 minutes. \nAFTER some stupid 'hostess' got her recipes in a right royal muddle - going very heavy-handed with the hot chilli pepper stuff. \nA late arrival - feeling in more need of food than drink - I took a few spoonfuls of the hostess's best (ill-prepared) mixes of hot spicey stuff. \nAs a welcomed guest - I managed to smile for 4 or 5 minutes - even though my tongue. throat and larynx semed to be being incinerated - by the 1st spoonful. \nSome 6 or 7 minutes into this Cocktail Party - the 2nd spoonful seemed to be doing a lot of mischief to both the lower reaches of my alimentary canal - and my spinal column. \nPHEW - sticking my head down a toilet bowl wasn't QUITE what I was looking forward to - when accepting the kind invitation. \nMy hostess admitted she might have got her recipes a bit muddled up - and when I left - around 9-30 pm - insisted I MUST come again - for her next party - which I promised to do. \nLYING through my frozen/volcanically blitzed teeth. \n \nHmm - it nearly blew my head off, Lily - but the collateral damage was limited to serious loss of hair -from the age of 40-something. \n; ))          \nNeither my wife or I like heavy spices, and yet our children love them!......          \nI'm with Thomas - my kids think \"the hotter the better !\", while I am happy with no hot things at all.          \nMild only for me, spicy food gives me chronic indigestion, I'm quite willing to admit I can't take it.          \nLily, I know how you feel.  My stomach will no longer tolerate the monster peppers.  I used to love jalapenos in Mexican food and chili, and now they give me fits.  If your hubby wants his food blazing hot, then add some to his plate and keep yours mild.  Also, keep the Pepto handy.  It will cool the burning.  Good luck!          \nI am a medium sort of fellow. \r\n \r\nThose in the picture look really aggressive. \r\nScotch Bonnet is way too hot for me.          \nI can't take anything much hotter than a green jalape\u00f1o, while hubby loves them the hotter the better. He does suffer the after-effects, though, heh, heh.          \nI like it hot, but not that hot. I grow Tabasco peppers and make my own sauce which is quite a bit hotter than the Tabasco brand sold in stores.I also like to taste the food, that's why I like it hot, peppers add wonderful flavor.We also grow jalapenos and make cheese stuffed peppers we keep in the freezer. \r\nSeems like a new \"hottest pepper comes out every year lately.The Ghost pepper (Bhut Jolika) set the record a few years ago and then the Naga Viper came along.(It was grown in England) Now this one.How hot can they get?          \nWe both don't like spicy food at all!! \r\nWe like to taste the food. \r\nI have acid reflux and can't handle spicy food.=)          \nGrowing up with Thai food, I love hot.  There was a time when I can handle it better than I do now.  I was in a jalapeno eating contest with a friend of mine once, and we ended it tied.  Now, I couldn't do it.  In fact, those peppers in your link looks like the ones I am growing in a pot outside.  I thought that they were bell peppers.  My husband took one and bit into it.  He about died.  He said that they were the hottest peppers he'd ever eaten.  I laughed and called him a wuss.  A week later he was still talking about it and so I took one and bit into it.  It tasted like a bell pepper.  He did the same and said that this one was different.  He then said for me to eat the top and I did.  I just about died.  It was the hottest thing I ever ate.  lol.          \nI don't think I will be growing any of those, although I did find the seeds at the Chili Pepper Institute. I like a little spice, but I don't think I'd like a plant where the fruit burns through latex gloves! \r\n \r\nI do like a little 'bite' of spice; chilis and other peppers. I like 'medium' hot; enough to feel it but not enough to totally overwhelm my mouth. My husband likes more heat than I do and so does my dad. \r\n \r\nMy dad always had red pepper flakes on the table, and he'd use the pepper on just about any savory dish. My husband likes the red pepper flakes too. We typically have 3 or 4 bottles of chili sauce around the house; tastes and heat vary depending on the type. We use every thing from smoked paprika, fresh ground black pepper, cajun spices, italian peppers, to fresh peppers that we grow. We even like Korean kimchee....with rice....:) \r\n \r\nI've grown habaneros, serranos, jalapenos, and poblanos in a large pot in front of my house. The chilis are free for the picking for any of my neighbors. I'm trying to decide which peppers to grow this year. Poblanos are my favorite, but I need some with more heat for my husband and neighbors. \r\n \r\nThanks for the link, Lily!          \nI have developed a sensitivity to hot peppers, can't tolerate it now and will suffer heartburn for a week. I used to love going to an Indian restaurant and eating a variety of spicy dishes.          \nMy hubby won't try anything spicy at all. \r\nMe - I just like mild to medium hot.  I cannot eat Indian food at all.  I have tried two different dishes in Indian restaurants, many years apart, and I was actually physically sick after each one.  So, I've got the message now and just don't eat Indian.          \nI love hot spicy foods but like you, still want to be able to taste the other ingredients, not burn my taste buds off. \nI love Thai foods and anything with chilli in it. \nJust recently we have discovered curries, love them. \nI like Mexican food but my husband doesn't  so I don't eat that very often. \nHungarian foods can be very hot and spicy, their fish soup comes in different levels of hot. \nOnce when we were young and living on Maui, my husband took our then 1 year old son to visit a house where his 5 to 6 single male friends lived near the beach. \nMore of a crash pad then a house. \nThese crazy Hungarin guys would cook  a huge pot of food for the day and most of these guys were from the countryside of Hungary where they love very hot foods. \nOne of those \"idiots\" gave my son a chilli pepper to eat and being just a baby it went straight into his mouth. \nPoor thing, I almost killed my husband when I found out what happened and he was banned from taking out son to that house again. \nHave just discovered a nice sweet and hot sauce from Thailand that I am putting on almost everything, it is call Mae Ploy sauce. \nGrew up in S. Calif. and have lived in New Mexico for a few years, love green chilli Mexican style foods, too bad my family isn't on board with that.          \nIf the top of my head isn't damp and the sweat isn't dripping of the back of my head, it's not spicy enough.  Wednesdays at work is NACHOS DAY (nachos, beans/hamburger mixture, shredded cheese with condiments on the counter).  I get a small portion and doctor it up.          \nI never liked hot food at all.

Spanish uses multiple words for 'you,' and from the way you phrased the question I gather that your friend is similar to you in age.  The best approximation is that if you would use Mr./Mrs. in English, you would use the polite form, and not the form in this translation. \r\n-I had to change the wording slightly in a few places- most notably \"I do not believe it will\" cannot be left without a verb there in Spanish- the translation reads \"I do not believe it will be a problem.\" \r\n-I assume Tuffy is the name of a pet, but if not, I cannot think of a case where you would have to change the wording. \r\n-You did not provide your gender or your friend's, which matters grammatically in Spanish much more than English.  I avoided phrases that would need to be changed though, so you should be okay either way. \r\n-You should probably start you letter with Querido (male friend's name) or Querida (female friend's name), meaning Dear _____, and end with Atentemente, (your name) meaning Sincerely. \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd wait a minute...If you talk to them on the phone, they must speak English...?

The recommendation is to drink a glass a half hour before eating in the morning, and right before bed. \r\n \r\nYou might want to search your own favorite medical sites to confirm this..          \nI think so, especially if the water has had more than a passing acquaintance with some hops.          \nI really do not get eight glasses of water a day. I must admit I drink a lot of tea when I should be drinking water.          \nWater is boring, I drink coffee, punch, beer, whiskey, and milk. I do have a glass of water on my night stand because if I don't I will wake up in the middle of the night dying of thirst.  As long as it is there I never have need of it though.          \nIts all we are drinking beer is too expensive, unless we turn too petrol which is cheaper than beer.          \nYes, plus milk, Gatorade, coffee, teas and juices. \r\nKeeps my joints and muscles happy.          \nYes I drink that much and more. \r\nWater does help the complexion. I was told by my doctor that I needed to drink more water dues to the dry skin I am having and yes it does cleans out the kidneys. \r\nWhen they are referring to 8 glasses it mean 1 cup of water, so really that is not a lot. I keep a 16oz glass nearby and refill and drink from it all they long.          \nit's a load of rubbish. If you sweat you want to drink more. Any drink be it fuit jiuce tea or coffee (yuk) \r\ncounts as water. Alcoholic drink doe snot          \nI do drink enough water, I know because if I don't I get a headache that doesn't stop until I drink a liter or more. In this 100 F. degree heat (which returned to the area this week) I keep a glass of water with me throughout the day. I get my water filtered and drink nearly a gallon a day at home besides what I drink at work (4-5 glasses or more)          \nYes but most of it is in coffee and tea. As it is I can't walk past a rest room without leaving some  behind.          \nI have heard that the eight glasses a day thing doesn't hold \"water\" any more, lol. You can become overhydrated, and there is such a thing. I probably don't drink actual water, but I do drink a lot of iced tea made with gallon jugs of spring water, because our tap water is too horrible to contemplate drinking. I'm sure you're doing fine, Lily, and I also keep a glass on my bedstand.          \n\"Power\" gave you the correct equation.  That includes ONLY water.  Even tea or coffee goes through the digestive tract before hitting your kidneys.  Water is the only thing that is not digested, so it goes directly to your kidneys.   \r\nPersonally, I drink WAY MORE than the minimum.  I drink about 2 gallons of water a day.          \nI drink 8 glasses a day, but sadly I don't see or feel any benefits that they go on about. I WISH My skin would improve, as well as my digestion, but I need Prune Juice for that!          \nWater is good.  Living Water is better.          \nI make far more water than I drink Lily. \r\n \r\nPerhaps it's an age thing. \r\n \r\nGiven the choice, I'd prefer to drink brandy. Pity it doesn't come out of the taps.          \nI think I am drinking enough,but not 8 glasses a day,although I have tried it. Water when you arent thirsty can be hard to get down and make you feel sick. I try to drink fruit juice or smoothies.          \nIt is recommended we drink the equivalent of 8 glasses of water a day, most will come from food and other drinks.  \r\nI will have a glass of water once or twice a week          \nProbably not Lily,it's still cold and drinking water does not appeal at all,different though in the warmer and hot weather,my doc told me that if your wee is practically colour and odourless, you are drinking enough water, no need to count glasses.          \nIt depends on your doctor.  Some tell me water, some tell me any fluids count, some tell me 8 glasses if you sweat or get hot.  Most tell me to try to stay hydrated.          \nAlways -          \nYes, I drink lots of water.  I have been aware of how important it is for a very long time and try to encourage others to drink water.          \nI am diabetic and dehydration is a very serious issue with this condition. I live in a very hot region. So, yes, I do see to it that I drink sufficient water. And even more important, I do not spend money on boutique water. I do have a filter in my fridge, but tap water is often better than what you get from the bottle because it is fluoridated.          \nAfter suffering from kidney stones twice in which one was the size of a golf ball, and had to be removed surgically, you bet I drink more water. I drink at least 96 oz per day. That along with the water that is included in foods which also count for the intake per day. Green tea is a great drink my urologist says. I just can't seem to find one I really like.          \nHi Lily, \r\nI had an uncle that the doctor posed that question to. My uncle said that he did, and in drinking coffee. The doctor said \"no, I said water\". So to this doctor it had to be water. \r\nI drink several glasses of water, probably 6 on a hot day and a lot of iced tea. I drink I am guessing 150 ounces of tea in a day (yes it is a lot, but I do).  \r\nSo if I can count the tea, I get plenty of water.          \nYes - I do but I have to harp on my husband - to drink enough water. \n \nI drink 3 full large glasses a day - taking my am pills - pills with my dinner and with my before bed pills. \n \nI drink 4 to 6 cups of coffee and a large glass of Ice tea. \n My daily orange juice. \n \n------- *** The secret is - to always use a large glass for all liquids. *** ------ \n \nI - like you - take a glass of water to bed and usually drink most of it. I get a dry mouth from sleeping with my oxygen. \n \nVery good question and a good reminder. \nGood answers too. \nDeeJay.          \nI used to drink more water than I do now.  We have beautiful clear water straight from the tap here in Fife and, if we do get any really hot sunny days, I do drink more water then to quench my thirst.  However, it is only because I am thirsty.  I wouldn't drink water just because it is recommended I do so.          ", "question": "\n    It is recommended we drink approx 8 glasses of water a day or so we're told which I struggle with big time. \r\n \r\nWater is a must for many reasons to keep the kidneys flushed, great for the complexion, aids digestion etc.. I don't drink 8 glasses a day though but I certainly drink at least 3, mainly with meals. \r\n \r\nI also like my 2 cups of tea, 1 cup of coffee and fresh fruit juice. \r\n \r\nParty times yes I like my G&T, red or rose wine and maybe a nice cold glass of Guiness which of course is good for your iron content. \r\n \r\nI always take a glass of water to bed with me as I take my meds first thing in the morning. \r\n \r\nSo do you think you're  drinking enough water ?

So yes, they should watch out for you, help you in disastrous situations and such.          \nyou do know you can add details to your question right?          \nWell, you'll have to rely on my other answer. I haven't changed my mind.          \nThe teacher is probably just concerned with the safety of his students.  He knows that he is the one in charge and it is his responsibility to keep you safe.  If there was a school shooting, I think that the teacher should do whatever he can to help the students, depending on the situation.  It might not be possible to help the students get out, so he might have to just direct them and remain with the injured.  After all, as a teacher, he would be a leader, so he would have to tend to his students.          \nWell it could be he has experienced this before, and is trying to prevent it from happening again.          \nHere's hoping you have enough brains to figure it out yourself.

It's nice to know that we still lead the world in something. \r\n \r\nHave you tried an electronic water treatment unit?   It doesn't actually make the water any softer, but it does make the limescale easier to remove and it appears to stop the pipes furring up.          \nI'm in Devon. Our lovely soft water is from Dartmoor or from reservoirs in the Culm Measure soil areas.  After heavy rains the rivers can run tea-coloured from the peat in their headwaters. (Photo) \r\n          \nI live in The Lake District we have the softest water in the country          \nGalilee water is very hard and we too have the problem of lime-scaling in the electric kettle and it also affects the quality of laundry.          \nI am in celtic area and the water when you open the tap  is brown quite disgusting and the taste horrible, they still they ask us to pay for the dammm thing !          \nHere in Hampshire (chalk soil) the limescale build-up is very rapid. We have a Britta water filter jug for drinking water, but the areas around taps and so on are a nightmare. Also, the soap doesn't lather well.          \nI have to answer your question this way: The water is so hard in my area, when swimmers dive into the lake most suffer concussions. (a little fun)          \nVery hard water. This area (Minnesota) has a lot of iron in it. There are many iron mines in the northeast part of the state. The yard at my cabin has rusty rocks in it which are rocks loaded with iron. I have to clean the stains out of the sink and around tub drain weekly. \r\n \r\nI tell people I dry my dishes with a magnet, LOL.          \nMy well is hard water so I have a water softener. I have to put softener salt in.          \nHard water here, no matter where we live it is hard water but we don't have any build up like you do, to get soft water here people have to buy a water softener heater etc to get soft water..I don't like soft water because that will cause build-up..my sister has one and I just don't like it or even the smell of it..I won't even drink it either..=)          \nWe have great water.          \nHere in Budapest we have hard water. \nHave to use things like calgon in the washer once in awhile to remove lime scales. \nThe plus side is we have a natural lake of mineral water under the whole city. \nThe spas here are probably some of the best in the world. \nI buy bottles of mineral water to drink by either the liter or 2 liter size. \nYou can also go to a couple of spas in town, bring your own bottles and have them filled up straight from the earth. \nOne spa the Rudas has 3 different kinds of mineral water for different physical aliments. \nIt is only about 25 cents a liter and well worth it. \nEven the store waters are between 25 cents to 70. a bottle, so many brands of water to buy here all have the mineral content on the bottles. \nThe Rudas spa was built by the Turks over 500 hundred years ago and much of the building still dates back that far. \nSo good for old tired joints to soak in the waters. \nOne side has a swimming pool that is half mineral water and half \"normal\" water. If it was all mineral it would be too hot and take too much energy away from you. \nI don't even know how many spas there are in this country, they are everywhere. \nwww.budapestinfo.hu \nIn Las Vegas the water was very different, you can tell when you wash your hair, it was softer and smoother in Vegas. \nThe down side here is we have to replace our water heater more often as it gets a build up of minerals over time. \nIf I forget to add fabric softener in the laundry then our towels come out like they are made from cardboard.          \nHard water here.   Limescale,  but also rust!    My neighbors have a well dug thirty years ago, and pretty deep,   the water is so full of rust it turns you hair orange after you shower in it.   It tends to clog up any water softeners.    \r\nOur well,  a mile down the road,  dug sixty years ago, and fairly shallow,  is wonderful water.   We're so thankful.    But even our water is more hard then soft.          \nWhen I lived in the university apartment complex we had well water, it was the softest water I ever had. I bought Kirk's Castile bar soap and it bubbled up like bubble bath, and when I would get my hair cut the stylists would ask what I put on my hair it was so soft.  After I moved out it was discovered that the well water there was high in arsenic, the wells were shut down and the university moved over to city water.  I have had city water for 16 years, it is hard water, I can tell in my tea kettle, have to use vinegar every once in awhile to clean the crust that accumulates in the bottom out. The worst thing is that the water from the city is high in chromium so now I have both chromium and arsenic in my body from drinking so much water.  I used a water filter since I had city water but it wasn't getting everything and switched over to refillable water I get from stores.  The Castile soap doesn't bubble up like it did at the other complex and I have to use distilled water in my iron.          \nHi, Lily, we have well water that was soft when we first moved here about seven years ago, but we must need a new well because for the last two years it has gotten worse and worse. There is always a rust build-up in my sinks. It smells terrible and therefore tastes awful. I have to use a special water softener when I wash clothes and dishes, which is expensive, and we have to buy bottled water for drinking purposes. It is on our list of \"things to discuss w/landlord\".          \nWe have hard mineral water in our area of Oregon.  years ago, there was a large park for camping and family fun just above us.  It was well known for it's mineral water, that some folks thought was healthy, so they would take jugs up there and fill with water.  Someone bought the property and it is no longer a park.  It was a fun place to go.  Hmmm, maybe we could sell our \"healthy\" mineral water,  haha!  It sure is hard on our hot water tank as we need to keep filters in it.  We need to use hard water cleaners as we have rust build up if we don't.          \nBuckinghamshire is also a hard water area, Lily. \r\nWhenever, I go back 'home' to Yorkshire for a break \r\nwith friends, I forget that the water is so soft in \r\nHarrogate and then lather up as normal only to \r\nfind myself buried under a cover of suds and bubbles. \r\n \r\nTea tastes better too in soft water areas, giving a \r\nsoft smooth taste.          \nI live in a hard water area and use a water filter jug which improves the taste of the water, making it feel much softer to drink.  There's nothing wrong with drinking tap water but it can be a bit harsh. \r\n \r\nFiltered water also stops kettles from furring up which in turn saves on electricity.  The filters really do make a difference to the clarity of the tea.. I know they can be a bit pricey but I stock up when on offer.   \r\n \r\nI don't like the idea of using chemical descalers, I'd waste so much water making sure I get rid of every drop which rather defeats the object.. \r\n \r\nI use a little washing soda for the laundry. \r\n \r\nI don't mean to sound like a sales person, it is from my experience          \nI have soft rusty water with loads of sediments and farm chemicals in it, it leaves rust stains on everything after a few months,  my showers are brown.  Have been buying bottled water to drink for 23 years...          \nWe have our own well here in Pennsylvania. Our water is considered hard.... as it was when we lived in New Jersey.          \nGuess ill be the bad guy here. Our water testing shows our water is softer than a water softener could make it. Down side is you can't get your clothing rinsed out completely. Up side, all you need is a very little dab of shampoo to do the job.          \nYou are lucky with just lime scale. Our water comes straight out of a mountain with high mineral content. The worst mineral is calcium. It blocks everything up where the water is heated. We have extra filters everywhere to catch it and we have to clean them regularly!          \nDoes it really matter its all wet.          \nHere in Fife, Scotland, we have beautifully clear soft water.  I love a nice glass of cold water to quench my thirst. \r\n \r\nI know your area has hard water because when we holiday on the Norfolk Broads, I always have to give the kettle a good scrub as it has limescale in it.  We never have limescale at home.          \nThere is a close correlation between hardness of water and life expectancy.  \r\nOne explanation is that the soft water areas (basically, in the island of Great Britain, the whole of the south and east of England) have deeper soil, therefore better agricultural land, therefore wealthier agriculture, and therefore, over time better everything else, particularly because our kings have always preferred to reside here and have so favoured this part of the kingdom, making it their capital and providing it with more goodies such as our two traditional universities, our capital city, etc., etc. \r\nAnother explanation is that soft water is much more likely to absorb impurities because it is not already overloaded with lime (i.e. calcium) which may mess up our kettles but is not of itself harmful, whereas the chief contaminant more likely to be taken up by soft water is lead (from what until recently was the commonest constituent of water pipes).  \r\nA third explanation is that our heaviest industries (with their adverse effect on longevity) have always been concentrated in the north and west, in which case the fact that they are in the soft water areas is pure coincidence (except that industry began with water power, always more abundant on the hilly, upper reaches of rivers, where the water would also be, naturally softer).          \nI live in a wet water area. \r\n \r\nOr am I missing something?          \nI know the Kent water...Living in the East Midlands the water is okkkk. I would not say it is as soft as Scottish water, now that's a treat, but its more that acceptable.          ", "question": "\n    Our water here on the East coast of England is fairly hard which means annoyingly that  the limescale builds up very quickly. \r\n \r\nI have to buy costly descaling  cleaners to prevent the build up before it starts plus I find we use more soap than our lucky friends in the North of the country.  \r\n \r\nThey have lovely soft  clear drinking water which also froths up the soapy products quicker therefore saving money in the long run on those costly detergents. \r\n \r\nSo are you lucky enough to live in a soft water area or do you have to make do with the not so pure hard stuff?

But often she phones up and tells me to drink! on those days i guess i drink  1,5 to 2 Litres.   Thats why i love her!          \nBy drinking tea and coffee you are drinking water therefore you are probably drinking sufficient water and are up to your guideline. \r\n \r\nMe? I drink my water guideline via the beer I consume each day.          \nI have 1/2 pot of coffee in morning \r\nand at least 8 12oz of water a day \r\nyou can add a twist of lemon to water for flavor..:)          \nduring the winter months i let the water intake drop somewhat,just didn't feel like drinking cold stuff . but am now catching up again.i do count the tea i drink as it has no sugar or milk, and some is peppermint or chamomile. coffee doesn't count because i have it strong with a dash of milk .i do feel much better when i remember to drink water. adding a little fruit juice (about as much as you would cordial,and no added sugar) helps the body to absorb the water and makes it taste better.          \nI drink a lot of water.  I am diabetic and learned to let go of everything else.  I have some coffee in the morning, and water the rest of the day.  I don't care for the taste of artificial sweeteners.  I love Coke, but never drink it anymore, unless my blood sugar drops too low, then I'll have a few sips to stabilize.          \nI would think so.I get mine via numerous forms such as tea and sports drinks.Plus fruits such as grapes and melons contain some water.          \nYes, Water brings life and make your fresh and healthy. We must intake at least 5-8 glass of water a day.  \r\nTea and Coffee depend on the choice.  \r\nThanks          \nI mostly just drink filtered water.Every morning I drink 2 or 3 cups filtered through ground coffee beans.  \r\nLater in the day I usually have some filtered through tea leaves.At some meals I will drink a glass of water that has been filtered through a cow.At night I sometimes have a glass of aged water that has been filtered through some grapes. \r\nI think the answer to your question would be yes.          \nI know I should drink water but I will go days and days with no plain water.  I drink my morning coffees and then have my diet drinks and the only \"water\" I really get is the melting ice in my Sundrop. Then I have my evening coffee after dinner.  Thanks for reminding me that I need to do much better.          \nWhen I was in Lanzarote on holiday I seemed to drink gallons of water.  Now that I'm back home I hardly drink water at all.  I know I should, but if I'm not thirsty I don't see the point.          \nI like \"Larry\"'s answer. I think that is where I am on this issue philosophically. \r\n \r\nI recently heard a news item about how the \"eight cups of water a day\" idea is now considered bad advice. \r\n \r\nWhich makes sense to me because I would think that if you are constantly flooding your system with water, then you would be losing all the vitamins, minerals, nutrients, etc. that you go to so much trouble to put INTO your system. \r\n \r\nI myself like a regular intake of water, tea, coffee, grapefruit juice, and cabernet sauvignon.          \nYep. \r\n \r\nI drink like a fish; I reckon I must get through something like a dozen or more mugs of coffee each day, getting on for one or sometimes two litres of skinny coke and pint after pint of water out of one of those filter thingies. But I'm quite a big bloke so I reckon it takes more to fill me up :oP \r\n \r\nAnd in recent years I've found it helps to have a drink of water before a meal because I'm definitely slowing up in terms of how much active stuff I do in a day and don't much like the idea of putting on any fat. \r\n \r\nI wouldn't mind betting that if we talk in terms of weight I drink far more than I eat. \r\n \r\nOh! And yes, I know there is some kind of theoretical minimum liquid requirement - I have a brother who is quite an accomplished body-builder; he is a personal fitness advisor, dietician and manages a full contact kick boxing team and gym. He's one of those sickeningly perfect specimens of humanity. He often waffles on about such things but in the end all I hear is \"yortado this\" and \"yorta do that\". \r\n \r\nThe muppet should get out more, right? :o)          \nI drink enough liquids.  I drink some water, but not necessarily just water. I drink about 8 cups of coffee, 4 cups of milk, 4 cups of various fruit juices and 2 cups green tea.          \nYes i do. After a little medical problem I had a few years back, I made myself drink more water. I carry a bottle of water with me about all the time. Six to eight bottles a day. No I'm not wasteful. I use the same bottle all day, just refill it.          \nIf I did that, I might as well put a TV and the computer in front of the stool, because I'd have to go that often. I'm waiting for the announcement that says that is way too much for a day...and they will.  I have heard that coffee is actually good for me and it doesn't dehydrate as we've been told over and over.  We're just guinea pigs on this planet. \r\n \r\nSecretly, I drink water when I'm sick and need something to induce vomiting....works every time!          \nI KNOW I don't drink enough water! \r\nBut I have also been told to include coffee, tea (iced and hot) and other liquids in that daily liquid count. \r\nI still don't drink enough fluids.          \nI almost never drink water by itself. The city water here taste bad and smells like bleach. I've never found a bottled water that taste any better, not even the flavored ones. I do drink plenty of other liquids through out the course of my day          \nI usually do drink allot of water. \r\nMy chiropractor said everyone drinks too little water. I told him I drink tea and juices but he said they are foods and not water. Plain old water is good for the joints. \r\nWe are lucky now here in Hungary, I purchase mineral water for about 25 cents for 2 liters. I must admit, being new here and all, I am drinking sometimes a bit more wine then water.What the heck, it's cold outside and we don't have to do anything we don't want to, why not enjoy a bit. \r\nWe usually go through 2 liters a day for two people , not enough. \r\nyesterday, I did drink about 2 1/2 liters of water alone. I was super thristy and laid off the wine for a day.  \r\nSounds like am an alcoholic but I am not, it's almost cheaper to drink wine here then water and it doesn't make you sick or hungover like some wines we would drink in the states, very fresh and crisp tasting.          \nI am afraid I am one of those people that drink way too little (in any form). I have my one cup of coffee in the morning, and then I will be lucky to have one more drink sometime during my day. Usually a can of Pepsi (although I haven't even had that in a couple of weeks). \r\n \r\nI drink water when I feel thirsty otherwise, but I know I don't drink enough because I mostly always feel dry. And I have no excuse for not drinking--I used to be a nurse, so I am well aware of the health issues! Just pure laziness I guess....          \nI don't drink as much as I should, either.  I try and drink more water then coffee, tea or pop.  I also drink cranberry juice cause I was told that it was good for your kidneys.  I only have one kidney, so I am more careful on what I drink now.          \nI drink enough to keep me close to a bathroom.  If I drank more - I'd have to get rid of my computer chair & sit on a potty chair! \r\nThe rule I use is this...For each cup of coffee I drink - I also drink one full cup of water. \r\nI have a 4 cup max of coffee & stop by 9, then I switch to water.   \r\nThen I drink water throughout the day when I feel thirsty.          \nHi Lily... I learned, a very long time back, that there are far too many 'so called' experts, ever ready to tell us what to do... what to think... what NOT to think OR do. \r\nA pox on all their 'houses'. I listen to my body, and follow its advice... carefully. Everyone is entitled to their opinion... just don't try to ram your opinion down my throat.          \nI have to admit I do not drink the amount of water I should, but I do drink two or three bottles of diet lemonade ( small ) per day, one cup of coffee, and about three cups of tea!...          \nYes, I prefer to have my body hydrated as I dislike being uncomfortable and in pain. \r\nThe brain can give you it's full attention if it's not busy trying to warn you that your body is dehydrated.          \nNo, I don't. Our tap water tastes bad. I hope to goodness iced tea counts. It masks the taste of the water or else I use jugs of water from the grocery store (99\u00a2, fairly cheap). \r\n \r\nI just took your quiz and I'm supposed to drink 1.8 liters per day. If the tea counts, which it seems to, I drink an adequate amount.          \nI have a water-filter pitcher and probably drink 6-8 glasses a day on top of coffee and tea. If I don't I can feel it in my kidneys and go get a couple glasses and drink it down.  One and a half liters is not enough for me, especially in hot weather or when I have been doing strenuous work. Some days over a gallon.          \nI don't drink the recommended amount.  I'd float away.  I drink some each day and am trying to drink more.  I can tell when I haven't been drinking enough.  I get sore and I get headaches.          \nI have read that One should drink approximate 1/2 of their body weight in ounces everyday. For example, If One weighs 150 lbs then 75 ounces of drink water is suggested.  When I gained weight,  i did not make the added adjustment so I am slightly behind each day. I should be drinking approx. 10 - 11 glasses of water each day according to the suggestion.  When I worked, I kept a 1/2 gallon bottle near that I would pour out a glass unitl it was all done at the end of the shift.          \nEww..I can`t drink plain water. I drink about 5 or 6 mugs of differing flavoured liquids a day. Bovril, lemon tea, Earl grey, coke, rose hip tea, orange juice...

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090427090133AAcHxqa", "answer": "\nYes, I drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses a day.  I think it is extremely important.  In fact, a physician once told me that when you become thirsty, even just a little thirsty, you are actually dehydrated at that point.  I just always have a glass of water close by and in the car I have a bottle of water and just automatically sip it at every stop light.  I also know where the ladies room is in every store that I shop at!!!          \nyou need water to live though not everyone drinks it on it's own and you don't have to,i'm 62 and healthy, i don't know how you can love water,it's tasteless, i drink it mostly with squash, tea etc.          \nYou are right, I have known people who don't drink water and always drink coffee, tea and soft drinks, and they get kidney stones. One had them 3 times, 3 surgeries and complications the first two times.  Another had bladder cancer when she got older. Drinking enough water not only helps prevent kidney stones , it helps to prevent constipation, removes toxins from the liver, helps with metabolism, and is one of the best things to slow down wrinkles on the skin.          \nI drink water but not a lot, I prefer tea, coffee and diet coke.          \nNot nearly enough. As crazy as it sounds, I had surgery three years ago for a hiatal hernia. The procedure that was done left me with a small stomach, and less craving for some foods and liquids. Before that surgery, (which was a Godsend,) I drank at least 8 glasses of water and green tea a day. Now I have to remind myself to drink any, and then I may only drink a few ounces of water. I know how important it is, but it is almost as the idea of just drinking it alone is apalling. I can drink it when I eat, so I try to do so, but I admit I am terrible about not drinking enough. My mother had kidney disease and on dialysis. She hardly ever drank water all her life, but when she went on dialysis, and was told her fluid intake was mimimal, she began craving water. I suggest those of us that do not drink enough do so. One day we may wish we had it! It does help hyrdate the skin also. I'm going just as I finish this to get a big glass to sit by my computer. It is a habit that needs to be started immediately. Thanks for your question as a reminder.          \nCorona Gold is my choice.

Me no like.          \nI don't drink water, get it all from coffee, diet pepsi, or what else I drink. \r\nThere is nothing wrong with this, [I have researched] But its still a good idea to drink water if you can. I have never had any problems, [67] no stones or bladder problems.          \nInteresting Q. I do drink water. I find that many times when I think I'm hungry I'm really thirsty. But too much water at one time makes me sick to my stomach, always has. I have no idea why. I could never drink a glass at one sitting          \nCoffee, Tea, Crystal Light, etc. are all made from water. I don't understand why drinking that stuff isn't considered drinking water.It's 99.9 % water anyway. My husband never drinks water. Never has and he hasn't been in the hospital ever.          \nYes but prefer my beer.          \nI used to drink primarily sodas, until Diabetes II came to visit.

And I'm always reminding my husband to drink water also. I also told him yesterday he was drinking too much caffeine--colas and ice tes. He said people need a certain amount of caffeine--not so I told him.          \nAlmost exclusively, lots and lots of it.          \nI love water. I used to drink more when I was more active. Sometimes I have to remind myself. I rarely drink soft drinks, could count a years worth on one hand.          \nI don't much care for water.  Never have, but I drink it as a matter of discipline.  I mostly drink decaffeinated tea.   \r\n \r\nA few weeks ago a friend gave me a glass of crushed ice with a little lemon water and twist of lemon in it.

Truthfully, what ever is under me is fine. My wife though wants a firm mattress. I am one of those that is awake 8 to 10 times a night, so it really don't matter.          \nNo mattress - but a water bed.  I first got one when I had a bad back - I was surprised when friends told me to get a water bed for that problem. I thought a firmer mattress would be better. But they were so right ! I got that first water bed about 20 years ago, and never looked back. The comfort is phenomenal !

It's the anglicized version of \"Yahweh,\" and \"Yahweh,\" is supposedly the best guess at how the tetragrammaton \"YHWH\" was pronounced. But I agree with the scholars... Jehovah is a far cry from YHWH.          \nYeah... and...?  \r\n \r\nIt is a medieval misreading. I wouldn't trust what \"the watchtower society people say when it comes to talking about the Lord. Be careful. They are misleading.  \r\n-They are a bit cookie if you ask me.          \nJehovah is how Christian,s hold to be God,s name,it is  \r\ndescribed in the Holy Bible as Jehovah God,so I will stay with that one.          \nThat is correct. We praise Him with the name jehovah and He is alright with it. The best part is that He comes to us in the name of Jesus Christ. Whatever we ask for is in the name of Jesus Christ. Miracles happen in the name of Jesus Christ. We are saved by being baptized ib the name of Jesus Christ. We receive the holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues in the name of Jesus Christ. The greatest name in heaven and earth is Jesus Christ!.There is only one name underheaven whereby we must be saved and that is jesus Christ!          \nI heard that the YHWH had accent marks that led people to misinterpret the letters and get \"Jehovah\" instead of \"Yahweh\" as the name of God. This is the only name the ancient Hebrews did, and I imagine still to this day, say as the name-His real name is forbidden to be spoken.          \nCCC 206 - In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH (\"I AM HE WHO IS,\" \"I AM WHO AM\" or \"I AM WHO I AM\"), God says who he is and by what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is\u2014infinitely above everything that we can understand or say: he is the \"hidden God,\" his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes himself close to men. \r\n \r\nCCC 207  - By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past (\"I am the God of your fathers\"), as for the future (\"I will be with you\"). God, who reveals his name as \"I AM,\" reveals himself as the God who is always there, present to his people in order to save them.          \nI have heard the name Jehovah is God's name translated in another language.          \nYHWH is Hebrew, Jehovah is the recognised English equivalent. I doubt any english words would appear in the earliest available texts. \r\n \r\nIf you apply this to Jehovah, then the same goes for Noah, Moses, Abraham, etc. but do scholars dispute those pronunciations? \r\n \r\n--------------- \r\n \r\nAlso, where are you getting your Watchtower Bible and Tract Society quotes from? Page 7 & 8? Of what?          \nIn Biblical times names HAD MEANING. Therefore, they were routinely TRANSLATED (both in scripture and in secular culture) rather than TRANSLITERATED - the latter being semi-represented by \"Jehovah\" as a rendering of the TETRAGRAMMATON. \r\n \r\nSee for instance, Kephas is an Aramaic TRANSLATION of the Greek name, Peter. Were we to actually TRANSLATE the name into English, the closest equivalent would be \"Rocky.\" (Actually, such a rendering might give us a better indication of what Jesus saw in him that led to his renaming Simon as \"Rocky\" ... or Peter if you prefer.) \r\n \r\nThe name was used IN TRANSLATION some 28 times in the fourth Gospel. In each of these cases it is with reference to Jesus APPLYING THE NAME TO HIMSELF. However, there is no indication of the New Testament writers ever attempting to transliterate the name. In light of this, there is also no reason any modern Christian should attempt to use a MEANINGLESS TRANSLITERATION of the name.          \nNot all scholars say / believe that.  \r\n'That'..being what u said. \r\nI don't have to go look it up, bc TeeM already gave it up. \r\nI will add, that while it is true No one knows exactly  \r\nhow God's name YHWH is pronounced.  \r\nBc the Israelites stopped saying the name; \r\nout if their own superstition. \r\nThis alone, does not mean we (mankind) should not use  \r\nHis divine name.  \r\nHe had it included in the inspired Scriptures,  \r\nFOR US TO KNOW & USE. \r\nScholars have agreed on 2 spellings of the divine name. Yahweh & Jehovah. \r\nJehovah being more well known around the world. \r\nAnd in most Bibles @ Ps 83:18 & Ex 6:3, \r\nsome have footnotes regarding His divine name, \r\n@ these texts. \r\n \r\nedit:  \r\nLineDancer... \r\nGood! One!!!!!!!!!!! \r\nI vote B/A!          \nIf you are going to take issue with \"Jehovah\" being the accepted name of God in English, take a look at God's name in other languages: \r\n \r\nAwabakal - Yeh\u00f3a \r\nBugotu - Jihova \r\nCantonese - Yehwowah \r\nDanish - Jehova \r\nDutch - Jehovah \r\nEfik - Jehovah \r\nEnglish - Jehovah \r\nFijian - Jiova \r\nFinnish - Jehova \r\nFrench - J\u00e9hovah \r\nFutuna - Ihova \r\nGerman - Jehova \r\nHungarian - Jehova \r\nIgbo - Jehova \r\nItalian - Geova \r\nJapanese - Ehoba \r\nMaori - Ihowa \r\nMotu - Iehova \r\nMwala-Malu - Jihova \r\nNarrinyeri - Jehovah \r\nNembe - Jihova \r\nPetats - Jihouva \r\nPolish - Jehowa \r\nPortuguese - Jeov\u00e1 \r\nRomanian - Iehova \r\nSamoan - Ieova \r\nSotho - Jehova \r\nSpanish - Jehov\u00e1 \r\nSwahili - Yehova \r\nSwedish - Jehova \r\nTahitian - Iehova \r\nTagalog - Jehova \r\nTongan - Jihova \r\nVenda - Yehova \r\nXhosa - uYehova \r\nYoruba - Jehofah \r\nZulu - uJehova          \nYou are correct no one knows exactly how YHWH was pronounced.   Just as scholars say that it is not correct many say it is.  The argument will continue . \r\n \r\nThere were no written vowles in ancient Hebrew theu had to be added by the reader. \r\n \r\nJehovah just followes the convention of all other Hebrew names that start with J \r\n \r\nJob \r\nJerimiah \r\nJohnadab \r\nJoshua \r\nJakim \r\nJemimah \r\nJezabel \r\nJerusalem \r\n \r\netc \r\n \r\nSo the English form Jehovah has been accepted for many centuries, Yahweh would possibley be closer, but  then we would have to change all the Bibles with all the other J names would we not?  So Jehovah is the most widely accepted form in English, why change it/          \nThe word Jehovah has been created by adding the vowel signs for Adonai to YHWH. The first time the Tetragrammaton appeared in an English Bible was on the title page of William Tyndale's Bible translation of 1525, where it was written as Iehouah. This was an interlace of YHVH and Adonai. The King James Version also originally used Iehouah, influenced by the Ben Chayim codex. The King James Bible changed the spelling to Jehovah for the 1762-1769 edition.  \r\n \r\nRevised Standard Version pp.6-7 \"The form Jehovah is of late medieval origin; it is a combination of the consonants of the Divine Name and the vowels attached to it by the Masoretes but belonging to an entirely different word. The sound of Y is represented by J and the sound of W by V, as in Latin. The word \"Jehovah\" does not accurately represent any form of the Name ever used in Hebrew.\"  \r\n \r\nIt is unfortunate, that the name was transliterated into German and ultimately into English as Jehovah, for this conflate form represents the vowels of Adonai superimposed on the consonants of Yahweh, and it was never intended by the Jews to be read as Yehowah (or Jehovah). The Jewish Encyclopaedia explains;  \r\n \r\n\"A mispronunciation (introduced by Christian theologians, but almost entirely disregarded by the Jews) of the Hebrew \"Yhwh,\" the (ineffable) name of God (the Tetragrammaton or \"Shem ha-Meforash\"). This pronunciation is grammatically impossible; it arose through pronouncing the vowels of the \"?ere\" (marginal reading of the Masorites: \"Adonay\") with the consonants of the \"ketib\" (text-reading: \"Yhwh\")\"  (25/9/2005)  \r\n \r\nCombining YHWH with Adonai is referred to as interlacing, fusing or superimposing. It could hardly be considered accurate or respectful. The illogical fusion of the sacred Name with the vowel points of another name is shown in the preface to The J.B. Rotherham Emphasized Bible:  \r\n \r\n\"To give the name JHVH the vowels of the word for Lord [Heb. Adonai], is about as hybrid a combination as it would be to spell the name Germany with the vowels in the name Portugal - viz., Gormuna. The monstrous combination Jehovah is not older than about 1520 A.D.\"          \nThe name \"Jehova\" comes from the three hebrew words, \"Haya, Ho've, Yihi'ye\" translated as \" he was, he is, he will be\"          \nYes and in some villages in Ethiopia the people had great difficulty pronouncing my name.  So they took to calling me \"Anbessa LIb\" (which they told me is \"Lion's Heart and has great meaning here....\"  Some how I always suspected it really meant \"Look at fatso!\" but I digress......).  So even though they didn't pronounce my name just right, both they and I knew who they meant.  I suppose God is at least as intelligent as me and the Ethiopian tribesmen.          ", "question": "\n    Yahweh was changed into Jehovah by Christians -- Mark 12:29  \r\n \r\nHarpers Bible Dictionary says that the name JEHOVAH was \"the result of the translators' ignorance of the Hebrew language and customs\" (1985 edition , p. 1036)  \r\n \r\nThe Book \"World Religions From Ancient History to the Present\" says :  \r\n\"The name Jehovah is a medieval misreading and does not occur in the Hebrew Bible\" (edited by Geoffrey Parrinder, p. 386)  \r\n \r\nThe Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible says the name Jehovah is \"an artificial name\" (vol. 2, p.817)  \r\n \r\nAsimovs Guide to the Bible says that the name Jehovah \"arose by mistake\" (vol 1, p. 135).

The Authorized translation (the King James version) is based ultimately on the 1525 translation by Tyndale and the translators deliberately sought to preserve Tyndale's language. He wrote in the language of his day \"so that the Bible might be understanded by a plough boy\", but English had changed so much by 1611 that Tyndale's language had by then acquired the impressive solemnity of antiquity, and their translation abounds with words and phrases that would have already seemed outdated to English speakers of Shakespeare's day  (\"his\" for \"its\", \"yes\" used only as the contradictory yes (the French \"si\"), \"you\" always replaced by \"ye\" in the nominative, etc. etc. The 1611 translators did not seek deception, only the respect for the word of God that they conceived would attend such solemnly old-fashioned language.          ", "question": "\n    I am used to read the Bible in French. Sometimes when doubt i check in Hebraic version - the original language of the Bible. I checked some parts in Spanish and Chinese version: they are excellent translations. \r\nBut English version several times let me puzzled. For example tonight. \r\n \r\nSome weeks ago, i read in new testimony that before Easter (the Pessah), Jesus asked to his disciples to 'untie the colt'.  \r\nI was happy to learn - thank to the Bible - this new word: the colt was so, in old English, the baby of a she-donkey. \r\n \r\nThis episode about 'l'\u00e2non le petit d'une anesse' is famous: according to the prophets (including Zachariah), the Messiah will come ' on a baby-donkey, the baby of a she-donkey'. \r\nMoreover we could take it as a sign of modesty; and the Torah, first part of the Bible was warning the future king 'not having to many horses' and 'not bringing them from Egypt'. \r\n \r\nTonight i look for' words in Harrap's shorter dictionary, to learn them in English.

I have 30 pages of Food Allergies. I only eat out at a few restaurants because I don't like the stress of it all. But when I eat at Bertucci's, I usually save room for dessert. :)          \nthe starter for me , soup usually. don't eat much these days though, if we have fish & chips we share a portion !          \nThat is a lot of food right there \r\nOur restaurant give out free bread or roll before a meal  \r\nso what you mention is a no no because we would be full \r\nbefore the meal comes.          \nGimme desert every time !!          \nAlong with about 13 other addictions I ought not give details of, I've always found SOUP irresistible - especially if accompanied with warm, fresh baked rolls, with lashings of butter. \nMain dish - my current state of health points me inevitably towards FISH - light tender flakes of sole, haddock or similar - with a few token veggie thingummies. Serious gastric problems have made me cut down on tartare sauce. \nIf a 3rd course is thrown in anyway - I'll opt for the cheese board, nibbling a few biscuits and \"A nice piece of Wensleydale, Gromit\". \nSo long as I have time to slip down a couple of large scotches AND pop outside for a ciggie AND settle the bill. \nIf raucous. restless grandchildren are in attendance, it can put me under a lot of pressure, believe me. \n; ))          \nProbably the dessert. \r\nI'm stuck in the 70's,as my favourite meal is - \r\n \r\nPrawn cocktail. \r\nSteak au Poivre,garlic mushrooms,chips. \r\nBlack Forest gateau. \r\nIrish coffee,or similar.          \nCongratulations on your healthy eating habits.Mine is one course.

A good salad is always nice.          \nIt is not just being old that did this for me...even when I was young and dating, I would still much prefer a starter course of soup (I LOVE homemade soups!) than a sweet afterwards.  \r\n \r\nI have been wracking my brain (a long process at this age) and can only think of 3 or 4 occasions in my whole LIFE where I opted for dessert!          \nI don't eat out very often.  When I do it is not a treat or a pleasure.  It happens only when necessary.  I really don't like having to eat anywhere except in my own home.   \r\n \r\nOn the occasions that I do have to get something to eat I prefer sitting on a park bench eating sandwiches but I will sometimes go to a fish and chip restaurant if it's too cold to sit outdoors. \r\n \r\nI have never, ever been to a dinner party nor have I ever given one.  I've had visitors staying with us a few times so we've had a full house but that is the sum of my catering history.  I have had 4 holidays in my entire life which have involved eating in a guest house or a hotel.  Other breaks have been self-catering. \r\n \r\nI'm not very adventurous am I?          \nBeing diabetic I usually skip the appetizer and dessert so I don't over indulge myself.          \nMy preference is always for the starter.    Sweets are something I have no trouble passing up.   Like you,  I have a special fondness for pate....since it is something I don't make it home or eat very much of....if it is on the menu for a starter...that is what I go for.          \nI don't eat out often enough to have any preferences.It depends on the restaurant I guess.I've never been to a restaurant that only offers one or the other.If offered, I would choose soup over salad most of the time and if I had a large meal I would usually skip dessert.          \ni like appetizers first,  not much on desert.  question..deserts and sweets seem to be a big treat in uk...true?  an elderly lady told me it was ages before they got things back after the depression, and thats why they are so special...true?          \nI go with the answer from Ritaah.  I am not that keen on eating out, not even in the homes of friends.Most people seem to find that odd, especially for a woman whom they think will jump at the chance of having a meal either made for them or maybe bought for them. \r\n \r\nI'm a home bird and am just not comfortable anywhere else unless it's just for a cup of tea or coffee.          \nI went on a trip and cruise once, with a tour guide and a \"bus\" load of people.  Every place we went to eat, the food was prepared by gourmet chefs....the four to even five course type thing.  Quite \"fancy\".   \r\n \r\nOne night as we were seated reading the entrees, the lady sitting next to me said, \"I'll have the frons.\" (SP?)  I said, \"What's frons? \r\nShe said, \"shrimp\".  I looked her straight in the eyes and said, \"Well, I declare.  I CAN be fancy and eloquent if I want to, but it ain't no fun!\"  She laughed out loud and said, \"I LIKE you!!!\"  Both of us agreed that we couldn't wait to get back home (Texas, as you can probably surmised) and get a good ol'  \"greasy spoon\" hamburger, and yes, fries with that please.          \nA 2-course meal here in the USA can mean an appetizer and entree; entree and dessert or appetizer and dessert. \r\n \r\nI prefer to go with the appetizer and entree          \nWhen we go to a restaurant we aren't able to eat a 3-course meal.  I have a sweet tooth so I always have a main meal then a dessert.  Usually I take ages making my mind up which dessert, as I like them all.          \nMeat potato rolls vegetable peach pie ala mode lots of strong coffee.          \nI love salads so would go for the starter. \r\nAs a type 11 diabetic, I have to take a pill 30 minutes before eating, & getting a starter helps me time it easier. If I wait too long I feel sick. \r\nA lot of entree's in the USA are way too large so I chose something that I can take the leftovers home, for the next day & usually a chicken dish that I don't cook at home.  \r\nWe don't eat out very often anymore because of the expense but it's lovely to have someone take away the dishes & we all deserve a treat now & again. \r\nI have a son-in-law who is a restaurant manager & was out of work for almost a year, during the recession. \r\nWhen you eat out, you're also helping the workers put food on their tables.

But I love desserts and if there is a particular one that I fancy, I'll get that to go also.  Remainder of entree and the dessert make a lovely lunch the next day.          \nHi, Lily, I never order a dessert when I go out to eat because my meal is quite enough for me. If there's a salad I like it with my meal, not before. If we are at a buffet style place, I may get a small piece of dessert to eat with my meal, not after. Usually, at a buffet, the salad bar IS dessert to me.          \nMy husband and i had a restaurant we liked. Often we would each get the stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon with a delicious dipping sauce. That was on the appetizer menu. We'd first have a Margarita. That would be our whole meal, four large shrimp. We would be quite satisfied. In that restaurant, if one ordered from the dinner menu as well, the amount of food  on the plate was overwhelming! \r\n \r\nHe and I would often at many restaurants order just one meal and maybe one appetizer and extra plates. We would both be full and there would still be food left!          \nStarter - half of my chocolate shake. \r\nMeal - chicken sandwich or cheesburger. \r\nDesert - remaining half of chocolate shake.          \ni could live on puddings with cream or custard poured on top          \nThe starter would be my preference. \r\nHomemade soup or broth until the warmer weather then it would be a prawn cocktail.

It just emphasizes who HE IS!!!!          \nIt is the JW's who changed the bible by adding their writings by Charles Russell to go along with the bible.  That is what the bible warned carried the curse.   \r\n \r\nGod knows those who are His no matter what name they choose to call him.          \nJehovah which is the English for the Hebrew YHWH is not the same word as Lord (Adonai) so it should not be changed.          \nI disagree with the sentiment of your argument. Christianity is concerned with suppressing the idea of \"other\" gods, and therein calling their god 'God' or 'Lord' is a superior idea because it better portrays their God as the only God. \r\n \r\nIn constrast, by using the name Jehovah, one would be specifying that said god, Jehovah, is superior to all other gods, which is, to some extent, a polytheistic outlook.          \nThe word LORD in capital letters means Jehovah. The KJV translators usually translated it like that, following the Jewish practice of not saying the name of God. \r\n \r\nHowever, the New Covenant name of God is Jesus. The Bible says Jesus is the only name whereby we must be saved. \r\n \r\nAct 4:12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.          \nThe New World Translation of the Bible is Jehovah's Witnesses own translation, no other religious group uses this Bible and Jehovah's Witnesses make very little use of other Bibles. \r\n \r\nThe translators of The New World Translation were: Nathan Knorr, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, Fr          \nNo. The name Jehovah NEVER appeared in the Jewish bible. The sacred name of God was derived from the tetragramaton YHWH...Yahweh.... \r\nIn the 11th century, a Christian monk, confessor to the Pope, misunderstood a German notation, replacing \"Y\" with \"J\"...and setting the stage for the emergence of the false name Jehovah;....the mistake was picked up in the King James translation...and Joseph Rutherford...(who claimed to receive his Inspiration in a dream) choose to name his organization \"Jehovah's Witnesses\"....in a direct attempt to remove his group from any association with Charles Taze Russel's original 'CHRISTIAN Bible Students' group. \r\n The Original \"Jehovah's Witnesses\" NEVER claimed to be anything other than a main-stream Christian group, even using the CROSS, within a crown, as a symbol on all of their earlier publications. It was only under the tutelage of the 'drunken and violent' Joseph Rutherford that the Cross was replaced with the 'stake' or 'stauros' in Watchtower propaganda.          \nUnfortunately, JWs dont know who God & Jesus r so they cant b Christians (i.e. Heaven is 4 all true Christians & Hell is a real place - theres no 2nd chance). If the foundation was built upon sand so is the house no matter what u do 2 it. When the sand gives way both the foundation & all thats built upon it will collapse. The sea shall not discriminate & the storm with it shall b more ruthless than @ any other time in history. Nothing of human origin shall remain standing. \r\n \r\nHe who understands this shall look 2 build his house upon the foundation that stands 4ever upon the Rock that shall never b moved. He who has ears let him hear what is, has been & always will b 4ever the same. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those moving in later? \r\n \r\nThe NWT bible is slanted 2 support their religion (& the Watchtower bks). Its worse than a mistranslation b/c @ least some of it was deliberately tailored 2 fit the JW's false gospel. Most JWs will see it as being the true Gospel having not understood without Jesus they cant see the truth (also, false prophecies like the 1914 1 cancel out any JW's claimed so-called truth - they dont hv a clue & they'll just keep saying thats not exactly what we meant like the serpant did with Eve). \r\n \r\nJWs r really good @ gathering all kinds of info about God, Jesus & the Bible. Unfortunately, they & other religions/churches have taken an academic approach 2 understanding whats in the Bible. The problem is that they didnt come 2 understand the difference btwn gaining knowledge & a real relationship with God & Jesus Christ. \r\n \r\nFrom there the JWs, like most Catholics, Mormons, many Protestants, Islam, moonies, Buddhists, Hinduism, Christian Scientists, Scientology & others, having begun in error, began adding on more & more error as they got even further away from God's actual truth. Neither a label, title, name, its history, the amount of time it existed or claims about them means anything. Its the substance/actions behind them that makes it legitimate or a lie (calling a dog God doesnt make it so - getting hung up on a name among several 4 God (in the Bible) keeps people from finding the real Jesus). U can name anything anything (i.e. Calling something Christian doesnt make it so - Mt 7:21-23). A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition or usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). \r\n \r\nRegrettably, many dont actually take seriously whats stated in the Bible. They think/act as if they r smarter than God. But God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant b properly understood without going thru Jesus Christ (Jn 14:6; 5:39; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish people cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant, including the JWs. Its why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division). \r\n \r\nIts why theres many religions who made fatal mistakes as they built them on what man wants God 2 be like. I realized they cant all be right (Theres 1 Bible - why so many interpretations? II Pet 1:**19-21). Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they don't know). But it doesnt mean God doesnt know what He's doing. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those who move in later? \r\n \r\nThe main point missed (including JWs) is Jesus Christ is the only 1 in history whom stated that He's \"the\" way, \"the\" truth & \"the\" life & no 1 gets 2 God except by Him (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12) & is the only 1 whom came from God. Its fully true or theres no truth & cant be any God (He knows what He's doing or He' cant be God). \r\n \r\nSince Jesus is the only way 2 know God, it means \"the\" whole truth was complete & finished thru Jesus' teaching. This means any claimed new teaching & any other religious beliefs or from self-proclaimed prophets & teachers r null & void & cant lead u 2 our real God. God always knew all Jesus was 2 speak & do & all the dumb things man would do, including teaching false gospels. \r\n \r\nJesus couldntve done nor said all He did unless He had full knowledge of the entire OT (the NT didnt exist in Jesus' time - the only way Jesus could've known the whole OT is if God's with Him) & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus made them know & remember His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Not possible unless God caused it. \r\n \r\nJW's teachings r so out of sync with Jesus' actual teachings theres no way 2 patch the errors even with borrowed \"truths\". My advice is 2 get out while u can - the more u allow their teachings 2 program u the greater your chance of never finding our real Jesus Christ & u should warn others. Rewriting Bible passages & labelling it a new world translation doesnt make it any more true - reducing Jesus 2 \"a\" son of God cancels out the rest of JW's teachings or from other religions doing the same. Jesus rose from the dead physically not just Spiritually & no earthly religious organization is infallible only the truth that stands 4ever unchanged. \r\n \r\nBut whoever seeks Jesus with all his heart & soul will find God's Kingdom (u shall know the truth & it shall make u free). Why should God want 1 living with Him forever that doesnt want 2 know Him (reason 4 free will - Jn 1:12-13)? God's truth remains forever unchanged while religions & gods created in mans image dies with him (no religions can save u). \r\n \r\nOn 1 hand, God hates us b/c of our sins - neither being a good person as judged by men or religion can save u. On the other hand, God loves us dearly enough 2 send His Son 2 die for our sins - so that thru Jesus our sins could b forgiven if we sincerely turn 2 Him - Theres everlasting hope only in Jesus Christ & His Bible. \r\n \r\nvoyc4rmwldrns          \nI would say yes if it was REALLY removed from the Greek and IF Jehovah was the True Name of Almighty God. \r\n \r\nApparently the Divine Name was never in the Greek, so it has no place there. If God wanted it there it would have been there.  Jehovah is also an abominable translation of the I AM/YHWH. \r\n \r\nMy take on this from my blog is pasted in below: \r\n \r\nThere are no vowels in the Tetragrammaton, so we have no idea how to pronounce it. It could be Yaweh, Yahwah, YoYo, or even Yippee for all we know. Here is some interesting info: \r\n \r\nDr. J. B. Rotherham states in the preface of his Bible concerning Jehovah: \"Erroneously written and pronounced Jehovah, which is merely a combination of the sacred Tetragrammaton and the vowels in the Hebrew word for Lord, substituted by the Jews for JHVH, because they shrank from pronouncing The Name, owing to an old misconception of the two passages, Ex. 20:7 and Lev. 24:16...To give the name JHVH the vowels of the word for Lord [Heb. Adonai], is about as hybrid a combination as it would be to spell the name Germany with the vowels in the name Portugal - viz., Gormuna. The monstrous combination Jehovah is not older than about 1520 A.D.\" (Truthseek.net) \r\n \r\nJehovah's Witnesses say it is important to use Jehovah and to vindicate His Holy Name. But are they accurate in using Jehovah? No, they even admit it on pages 16 and 18 of the book \"Let Your Name Be sanctified\" they admit that Yahweh is the superior translation of YHWH. \r\n \r\nIn the preface of their own \"Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures\" page 23 shares this admission with the reader: \r\n\"While inclining to view the pronunciation 'Yahweh' as the more correct way, we have retained the form 'Jehovah' because of people's familiarity with it since the 14th century. Moreover, it preserves equally with other forms, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton JHVH.\"  \r\n \r\nIn other words, they know they have God's Name all wrong, but they are not going to change because people are more familiar with the WRONG NAME? \r\n \r\nThey are VINDICATING an incorrect name because people are familiar with it? What sort of Vindicating is this?          \nNo. \r\n \r\nThe texts do not use YHVH or any Greek version of YHVH. \r\n \r\nGreat answers by \"question it all\" , rev kip , and egyphile. \r\n \r\nThe Watchtower admits to knowing ''jehovah'' is wrong and even the orginating demonic source and yet continues to use the Gehenna bound trash. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nJehovah is a very bad transliteration of God's Holy name. \r\n \r\nRamon Marti polluted the name of God. Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ed was a heretical monk of the Dominican order is the first recorded person using \"Jehovah\". Ramon Marti was assigned the job to remove the passages from Hebrew and Greek manuscripts offensive to the \"Christian\" religion. Censorship at it worse to say the least. \r\n \r\nIn English it can clearly be seen ''jehovah'' is most definitely of the liar and serpent. \r\nJeh- \r\nIn some dialects \"jeh\" means \"jinn\" which is an evil spirit. 'Jeh' is also 'the whore'. In Persian mythology. She is responsible for the death of the first man. Jeh is also used for a consort, paid or unpaid, outside of the marriage bond. \r\n \r\nHovah- \r\nStrong's #1943 Hovah, another form for 1942; RUIN:-MISCHIEF \"Mischief\" as is meant means \"bad intentions\" or \"of evil intent\". \r\n \r\n'Jehovah' can be broken down into the 'whore of mischief' or ' demon of ruin' in Hebrew and Babylonian words.  \r\n \r\nLook up \u201cjeh\u201d or \u201cjah\u201d and look \u201chovah\u201d in Hebrew use a  Strong\u2019s Concordance. Do this for yourself and remember what you find every time you speak or teach or pray.  \r\n \r\nGod's name: \r\nExodus 3: \r\n14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. \r\n \r\nI AM that I AM \r\nHebrew- (\u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4,) pronounced ehyah asher Ehyah \r\n \r\nIn English YHWH is given modern definition JHVH and eoa from Elohim /Adonai. \r\nbad - very bad transliteration/translation via letter transposition. \r\n \r\nNote the last part of the above verse in Exodus 3:14 \r\n...Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. \r\nI Am is God's name. \r\nThis is E'yah pronounced eYah - a drawn Y in pronounciation or just Yah. Yah is God's name - not Jah - not Jehovah. \r\n \r\nThis is straight from the Hebrew. God's name is E'yah in all languages - do not be fooled by confusing arguments in this area because there are many convoluted, complex, manipulating, and justifying arguments. \r\nMany say Yah mean \u201cexistent one\u201d or \u201ccauses to exist\u201d. \r\nThat is error. \r\nE\u2019Yah means \u201cI AM\u201d.  <note the period! \r\n \r\nGod's sacred name is very simple to find and know. I am surprised that so many bible students over the years can not see this but the dark does not comprehend light. (John 1:4&5) \r\n \r\nIn Matthew 6:9 Jesus said; \u201cOur FATHER who art in heaven HOLY is your name Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .Give us this day our daily bread and deliver us from evil. \r\n \r\nJesus  used Abba and Father.

Faith is believeing in something that you have no way to prove. Faith is not based on past experience, or a surity of anything. Faith is emotional, a verb I suppose, where as Trust is more of a noun. I trust God, cause he has helped me through things in my life, But i have Faith because at times when I  can feel Him. That make any sense?          \nMy opinion:  \r\n \r\n\"Faith\" is a hope that things will turn-out okay in any particular situation or personal relationship.  \r\n \r\n\"Trust\" is a term we sometimes use to convince ourselves that our \"faith\" is justified. \r\n \r\nEdit: I would personally rather use the guideline of \"workability\".          \nThey both mean the same thing..          \nhey (((jon))), well, to me, they are almost the same but not quite, both comprise hope and both can be rooted in intuition. however, the trust i have in a loved one tends to be based on a knowledge of prior behaviour and general attitude,  in knowledge - i will have developed a sense of who they are, to what extent they can be relied or counted upon. even upon first meeting someone we will already be working out (through various means, such as non-verbal communication - reading of body language and decoding of micro-expressions- subconsciously analysing the tones and cadences of their speech and so on) whether we can or not trust him or her, whether the other person means us well or not (regardless of whether we sometimes get it wrong).  \r\n \r\nthe difference for me between the two concepts, between faith/trust in God and faith/trust in a person lies in the space between us, in what happens in that space, in the physical dimension (one which includes the biological and/or chemical aspects of human interaction). not the most spiritual of responses, i know... i have a feeling this is one of those deceptively simple questions and that the answer i have given you is going to nag me for the rest of the day, i'll warn you now, i may feel compelled to return and edit (though i promise i shall try to exercise some restraint, lol!). \r\n \r\nhey (((michael))), what a lovely answer :)          \nTo me, Trust is a word that you use when your confidence is low.  Whether you are depressed or confused or doubtful about several things all at the same time.  For the Bible says to have trust in Him. \r\n \r\nTrust is also like Respect in that you (build up) trust by \"seeing\" someone DO what they said they would do.  Trust is what we need in the Lord to Claim His promises.  We need to trust in ever bigger promises as we grow up as a Christian. \r\n \r\nFaith was first used in the Bible in conjunction with our faith in God to Save us based Solely on the Sacrifice that Jesus made.  Revelation 2:13, 19, 13:10, and 14:12 all use words saying (patients and faith of the saints).  Deuteronomy 32:20  has the first usage of this word and it pertains to The Salvation of those....who posses faith.  And the Second usage of Faith in the O.T. is Hab. 2:14 also talks about living by faith as it pertains to being saved. \r\n \r\nFaith's primary meaning is to believe that Jesus' Sacrifice atones for your and my sins.          \nSame for me. \r\n \r\nBoth \"faith\" and \"trust\" are relationally based: \r\nPerson-to-Person - within the Godhead; Father-Son-Holy Spirit \r\nPerson(s)-to-person(s) - God to human/humans/humanity \r\nperson(s)-to-person(s) - human(s) to human(s) \r\n \r\nEDIT: \r\nGiven some of the answers here, I wanted to clarify what faith means for me.   \r\n \r\n\"Faith\" for me is not really me-centred, but God-centred - Christ the Incarnate Son's faith and trust in the Father, by the mediation of the Holy Spirit is given to us by the Holy Spirit;  God shares His faith and trust in Himself (the Person-to-Person thingy, above) with humanity.  i.e., God gives us Christ's faith when He gives us the Holy Spirit; so we are no left to ourselves when it comes to facing death, but we face death with \"Christ in us, the hope of glory\" (Colossians 1.27)....          \nTrust is developed slowly but can be destroyed in an instant. With so many sensing that their trust has been abused, is it any wonder that people are reluctant to have confidence in others? According to a survey published in Germany in 2002, \u201cfewer than 1 in 3 youths have a basic trust in other people.\u201d \r\nFaith- primarily conveying the thought of confidence, trust, firm persuasion. Depending on the context, the Greek word may also be understood to mean \u201cfaithfulness\u201d or \u201cfidelity.\u201d\u20141Th 3:7; Tit 2:10. \r\nFaith is based on concrete evidence. The visible creative works testify to the existence of an invisible Creator. (Ro 1:20) The actual occurrences taking place during the ministry and earthly life of Jesus Christ identify him as the Son of God. (Mt 27:54;  \r\n\u201cTrust not to rotten planks,\u201d wrote English dramatist William Shakespeare. Indeed, before stepping onto the wooden planks of a boat, you would want to be sure that the wood was not rotten. \r\nTHE words of Shakespeare echo the sentiments of wise King Solomon of ancient Israel, who some 3,000 years ago wrote: \u201cA fool will believe anything; smart people watch their step.\u201d (Proverbs 14:15, Today\u2019s English Version) Yes, only a fool would go through life blindly accepting everything he hears, basing his decisions and actions on frivolous advice or baseless teachings. Misplacing our trust\u2014like stepping onto rotten planks\u2014can lead to disaster.          \nhi Jon: \r\n \r\nYou've already gotten some really good answers.  I'll throw in my two cents' worth for what it's worth. The terms are overlapping.  I happen to live near the source of the Mississippi, so I'll use a river as my point of reference.  Faith is what an eagle sees when she looks down on the water; trust what a fish sees from within it.  Both perspectives are \"true\".  Wisdom, at least for me, is understanding that the air and water are not separate, but parts of a living system that transform into one another over time.   \r\n \r\nhave a great day.          \nBlessings to all. Faith is hope in trust . It means you are hoping to see your faith come  alive  it's the substances of things  hoped  for, the evidence of things not seen  . Faith and trust always work together for   good they both means the same thing.          \nMy perception of faith and trust is this: \r\n \r\nTrust is vital in the foundation of any human relationship. There can be no harmony,  no positive energy flowing between two people without it.  Trust is the balance kept. \r\n \r\nFaith is infinite security, above and beyond this life, in this world.  It is 'the relationship' one must seek with The One, to find freedom from self, rest and peace, and their way back home...  :D \r\n \r\nPeace and Blessings \r\n(((((JON)))))          \nBetween G=d and people: \r\nFaith is about my belief in G-d and all the beliefs connected to Him  (my family and friends, my community, parish, Y/A, etc). Just believing in G-d won't save me if I have no trust in G-d. Even the Devil believes in G-d! I don't think he'll end up in Heaven! ;-)) \r\n \r\nTrust is more complex to define. It goes deeper than faith alone. Maybe that's why J'esus asks us to trust in Him (Divine Mercy). It's having confidence in him, or letting the reign of our life to Him. It's yielding ourselves or our free will to Him, to His leadership. It's very difficult for humans to accomplish as we must totally trust the loyalty and faithfulness of G-d to do so. One must know and love G-d very much to do that. It's to  learn to let go and to let G-d instead ;-) \r\n \r\nBetween parents and children/ between spouses/ family members: \r\nFaith: it's believing that one person can achieve great things in life. \r\n \r\nTrust: I think it has to do do with the truthfulness in people/ You can trust someone with your secrets for instance if they are trustworthy. You can trust your spouse with your marital vows because you know that person very well and trust that s/he has goodness for you in his/her heart. S/he will not betray you.  \r\n \r\nIn conclusion, Trust is more radical and deeper than Faith as it engages or involves you too. It's very intimate and compels you to put your trust into someone else. Let's hope that after trusting somebody we will not be betrayed! There's nothing more painful than to be betrayed by those you love!          \nfaith and trust. faith is what you give to a person you met off the street... until he proves other wise there's no reason to not have faith if someone says they will do something. now trust must be earned. if my neighbor says he will run to the store for me ill believe him. but i wont give him my bank card.. now my best friend i have trust in. he has earned it and i would trust giving him my card and pin.. for trust to work you must have faith. you must have faith in god before you can trust him. you have faith he exists in your day to day life then you will start to build a trust with him over time.          \nIf you are going to understand God, God's terminology you will have to learn from the bible not a mans Dictionary. \r\n\"For my ways and my thoughts are not your ways and your thoughts, and as heaven is above the earth, so are my ways and my thoughts above yours. \r\n \r\nExample: When you want to remove a tree from , lets say the front yard; what do you do? \r\nWhat do men do if they want to remove a tree? You will find them going to the tool shed, for a shovel and pick, or if you have money you will pay someone else ad find him with a shovel and pick. \r\n \r\n\"BUT\" Christ shows up and say: \"If you had faith as a mustered seed, you might say to this sycamore tree, be uprooted and be planted by the sea, and it shall obey you\" Luke 17: 6 \r\n \r\nWhose faith is this believing based upon, mans or the spoken word of God? What man do you know today that at removing a tree will speak to the tree and tell it to be removed? \r\n \r\nGod way and God's thought, Right\" The shovel and pick , mans way and mans thought right? \r\n \r\nHow many women who are ninety years old seek to get pregnant?  \r\nDo men get the idea that dead people can be raised from the dead?  \r\nWho do you know that walks on water? \r\nWho do you know who speaks to the raging water and boisterous wind to be calm? \r\nA person may have faith to swim to Catalina Island from huntington beach. \r\n \r\nA person might believe to climb the highest mountain peak, but they are within mans scope \r\n \r\nFaith is based upon the ability one has to fulfill the thing believed for. \r\n \r\nIf it is mans faith , then it is based upon his ability to do the thing believed for. \r\n \r\nTrust is believing. \r\n \r\nPutting your trust in God, will require you to believe God, and believing God is God speaking words and you hearing His word and you believing Him at His Word, is trusting Him to do what is impossible with men          \nTrust is based on repeatable performances. \r\n \r\nFaith requires no evidence/proof to happen.          \nI have faith in my abilities and trust my own thinking. \r\n \r\nRScott          \nI see them slightly different but feel it may almost be semantics. \r\nSeems in my Spiritual life the mean the same.  \r\nFaith is not hope to me, hope is hope. \r\nFaith is that I know all is working toward my coming to Remembrance no matter what my Human assessments may be or what it feels like. \r\nIn my Human relationships, I can have a relationship where my \"trust\" has been broken, & still ultimately have faith in that person knowing within they are the same as me. \r\nTrust very often is a judgment based on past experience, theirs & mine. \r\nFaith goes much deeper, it has nothing to do with the intellect but comes from the Wisdom of the Heart. \r\nA simple gift given to another, \"I have complete faith in you\" will very often help to release the bonds of past mistakes. \r\nI feel I may not have explained this well, the difference is subtle. \r\nBut this was a great Q! \r\nYou had me pondering this for 2 days. \r\nMany Blessings!          \nI think trust is built by faith/belief.  Theists trust God because they have faith in him.  I can trust my my paycheck will be go through because it has never failed to do so.   \r\n \r\nTrust to me is earned.  For me it's by reason and evidence, not faith.          \nFaith comes from the heart...trust comes from the mind. \r\n \r\nIn my own experience, faith requires no context, no history, nothing that must be known...it stands alone, unrelated to anything else.  Trust, on the other hand, arises from past experience with something or someone in which a context holds information to base the trust upon.   \r\n \r\nFaith is immeasurable, wholly connected and unified, based on nothing (no thing).  Trust is a measurement, a weighing, a judgment based on evidence.  With faith there is no comparison, while trust is solely derived from comparative evidence.

Over eating stretches the stomach and causes one to feel hungry sooner. \r\nI eat a multi vitamin for breakfast. My first meal is usually mid to late afternoon. Then, I eat before bed as this makes me sleepy. I eat twice a day and I feel very healthy at my \"fighting weight\". Weight control is about burning the caloric intake. If one wants to eat a lot they need more exercise.          \nGood breakfast.A drink and a biscuit for lunch and a cooked meal about 6pm.          \nI have Diabetes II, and therefore have to regularly, but must admit I sometimes miss one of those meals. TRY to also get in breakfast and my evening meal and maybe just some soup at lunch time.          \nSometimes more than 3, I eat almost whatever and whenever it is served to me. Official diet to start right after my birthday.          \nI eat when I am hungry. \r\n \r\nNot EVER when I first wake up--my usual \"brunch\" time is between 10 a.m. and noon, and I usually have a bowl of soup then that I have put together from pkged broth and vegetables and a bit of pasta. If I am feeling particularly hungry I will throw in some leftover meat or some shrimps. \r\n \r\nThen it is supper at around 6 p.m. and that is it for the day.  \r\n \r\nI am not a big snacker, either--don't tend to eat much between meals, unless I have missed a meal and then I will have a little something to tide me over.  \r\n \r\nI don't ever eat anything beyond 8 p.m. at night because I don't want to go to bed with a full stomach. It is totally uncomfortable for me to do so--usually causes acid reflux if nothing else!          \nI usually just have brunch now and a main meal around 5 - 6 PM.  Cannot manage to eat nearly as much as I did when i was young. \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nNo, there's no real routine here. With hubby working part-time, we don't always have daily meal times.  \r\n \r\nPlus, I'm not as good as many people here about sticking to a regimen for myself. I still tend to grab whatever happens to be there....and unfortunately that \"need to eat less now that I'm older\" still hasn't hit. (We went to the Asian Buffet for our New Years dinner....and I was doomed the moment we walked in the door, lol!)          \nThe way you described your and Mr Lily's (smile) eating habits just about covered the way we eat here. Not so much of a \"plan\" anymore. It's kind of a grab what you can when you can. Somewhere recently, I read the greatest li'l proposal for those enjoying the later years... it said one of the greatest joys of aging is getting rid of that urge to look at a clock when someone asks you if you're hungry. It's a terrible habit. I still do it sometimes... my husband does... but now we both look at each other and crack up when we do it. \"You about ready for some lunch?\" and the partner looks at the clock to determine if they're hungry. hahaha.... it's almost reflexive! \r\nBut yes... smaller amounts and sometimes even more than three times per day. It seems to work for us.          \nMost days, but sometimes I skip lunch.          \nWhen I am visiting friends, we eat 3 a day. When I am home, sometimes 2 or even one. If I am busy I sometimes forget to eat. Sometimes I like a quick snack. But I like the bigger meal to be breakfast.          \nTwo very small and one medium.  No junk food or snacks.          \nNot usually - one meal is enough.          \nOnly at one sitting my friend.          \nHave not been an advocate of three meals a day since I was a kid. \r\n \r\nMy wife has 3 per, large one to break the fast \r\nand two smaller ones and snack. \r\n \r\nI have brunch, salad, and cheese, decaffeinated  coffee or tea \r\nthen snacks--soy nuts, cheese sticks, half an apple, etc---- \r\n \r\nBecause of my work in info systems, regular meals did not work too well.

Awesome image there.          \nthere are endorphins released after sex that relax you.          \nPhil Collins answer is correct but there must be consent - otherwise it's rape.          \nNature's Own: The Feel Good Hormone  \r\nBy: Nicole Stevenson    \r\n Serendip.com \r\nSex feels good, that is why people do it for more than simply procreation. Laughing is enjoyable, for that reason people search for things that amuse them. Touch is pleasing, therefore the massage business thrives. These things can become addictive due to the pleasurable effect that they produce. People have been exercising obsessively for a long time but only recently was an idea postulated as an explanation. Laughter often begets laughter and in large doses, has the ability to make one feel high. We do what makes us feel good; human beings are naturally pleasure seekers. It is said that with drugs your first high is the best and never able to be duplicated. What keeps people using drugs, despite the downfalls associated with use, is that eternal quest for that ethereal feeling that they experienced the very first time. Pleasurable activities, like exercising, sex, laughter, touch, etc. can all become dangerously addictive. Some people will do anything and everything for 'that fix\".  \r\n \r\nSo what is it that makes people search for the next high, or feel good experience? Exercise, sex, laughter, and touch all produce positive effects within the body via chemicals in the brain. These chemicals are called endorphins, a mixture of the two words endogenous, meaning from within the body, and morphine, a powerful pain fighting drug that is also used and abused for recreational purposes. Endorphins are the body's internal pain regulators. The drug opium has been used recreationally as early in the ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian cultures. British physician, Thomas Syndenham brought opium to the public to be used for medicinal purposes around sixteen-eighty. By the end of the seventeen-twenties opium was outlawed in China, due to it's high level of recreational use and abuse. This led to the Opium Wars between the China and England. Opium was also used throughout the Civil War to treat battle wounds and in surgery (1).  \r\n \r\nCredit for the discovery and abilities of endorphins are given to various different people, at different times in history. In the mid nineteen-sixties Berkeley professor, Choh Li, discovered the analgesic, or pain reducing, significance of a certain pituitary hormone, which he named B-Lipotropin (2). Upon attempting to figure out why opium affected people the way that it does, scientists, Solomon H. Synder and Candace B. Pert at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Lars Tereniun of the University of Uppsala, and Eric J. Simon of the New York University School of Medicine discovered the receptor-labeling technique and stumbled upon the idea of the opiate receptor in the brain (3) These receptors are the sites upon which drugs, such as opium, morphine, and heroin, target and affect the user's behavior and mood. These research teams found that the opiate receptors seemed to be consolidated in the portions of the brain included in integration and perception of pain and emotions. If the body is in pain, opiates will diminish the discomfort. If the body is not in pain, a feeling of euphoria will come over the body and take the user to a different level of consciousness, the \"high\". Endorphins are the body's natural \"feel good\" drug.  \r\n \r\nIn nineteen seventy-five, John Hughes and Hans W. Kosterlitz of the University of Aberdeen managed to isolate peptides found occurring naturally within the brain. These peptides were called endorphins, meaning morphine from within, and were found to have pain reducing effects (4). Endorphins are now known universally as stress, or catecholamine, relieving hormones which act much like the opiate drugs opium, morphine, and heroin. When stress is detected by the brain, it sends out signals, or opiates, which bind at the receptor sites, and the pain is alleviated. Feelings of euphoria follow and soon become apparent.  \r\n \r\nEndorphins, much like the drugs that they mimic, have the phenomenon of eliciting either the fight or flight syndrome and/or the reward system, which is why abuse is possible. It is known and quite obvious that structures in the body have evolved through the decades. Evidence of the change within the brain's structures are apparent in the way that humans learn to adapt to situations and survive situations of pain. An endorphin rush allows an person to either stay and fight or run away, either choice quite beneficial to survival of the individual. Afterwards, endorphins also allow the person to be able to work with the pain its body is feeling and recover. These ground-breaking studies opened many doors for the scientific community to be able to study various angles of pain, depression, happiness, abuse/obsession potential, and homeostatic processes, such as eating and exercise, many angles which were previously barely understood.  \r\n \r\nThe checks and balances system of endorphins physically consists of chains of amino acids, which make up the chemical messengers known as ne          \nSEX : Several Eery Xylophones \r\n \r\n          Super Evil Xtreme          \nsex is a only thing of relaxed for man and woman, feel after sex very comfortable so sex is relax for person.          \n1)game of 0 and 1 in bed \r\n2)after working hard for long time we feel relaxed \r\n3)during these day's we think more about it so (if u think more u get more)  \r\n4)it's a nature          \nSex (well, more accurately, an orgasm) releases endorphins. Endorphins are \"feel good\" chemicals in your body that have a chemical structure similar to morphine. Random trivia - your body will also release endorphins during exercise (ever heard of the \"runner's high\"?) and even during laughter. Basically, people enjoy sex because it feels good. There have been studies which show there are health benefits to sex as well (look here -  Sex can be fun, but please, always be safe and use protection.          \nBecause when you have sex it releases endorphins which make you feel happy and relaxed, these endorphins are a great stress reliever.

Student, employment, visit, and other types of visas are all temporary NON-immigration classes of visas.  Amount of time you spend in the US on any of these is irrelevant since you are only allowed into US for temporary purpose.  You are not an immigrant. \r\n \r\nAlmost all (some 90%) US immigrants are sponsored by spouse or immediate family member who is a US citizen and who earns enough to support them.  As a student visa holder, you must return to your country of citizenship immediately upon completion or termination of studies.  You are not remaining in US - finish your course in school & return home.          \nYou can apply for naturalization after holding a green card for five years.  How long it takes to get the green card varies depending on how you're entering the US.  Marriage is the fastest route to a green card as it doesn't require you to live in the US for a time on a work visa first.  You also don't have to have a degree and a job if you obtain your green card through marriage (although your spouse will have to have a job).  Student visas are non-immigrant and time spent in the US as a student doesn't count toward either a green card or citizenship.          \nSgt. Star was wrong. Yes, you can get a green card by virtue of employment or marriage. It does not take five years.  \r\n \r\nThe citizenship requirement is that after you get your green card, you have to be in the US for five years before applying.  \r\n \r\nNote--If you've been in the US for five years without a green card, you are here illegally. In order to receive a green card, you'd have to leave the country and reenter legally--after a ten-year ban.          \nthis is a bit garbled information.  \r\n \r\nYou need at least a greencard to join the US army.  \r\nYou do not get a greencard based on living in the US. Living in the US on a student visa doesn't count.  \r\nYou can get a greencard based on getting married to an US citizen if that citizen sponsors you and has sufficient income to do so.  \r\nAlternatively an employer can sponsor you for a greencard, but not too many do.  \r\n \r\nI would suggest going to the USCIS website and reading through the ways to get a greencard.  \r\n          \nIf living in the United States for at least 5 years would lead to a Green Card, many of the 11 million illegal aliens would be Green Card holders by now, don't you think? Clearly, the Sgt doesn't think that far, which is why he had to enlist in the Army instead of getting a real job that requires usage of the brain or skills beyond saying \"Yes, Sir!\" and shooting at people. \r\n \r\nAn F-1 is a non-immigrant visa. There is no path from a non-immigrant visa to permanent residency. \r\n \r\nYou would need a reason to be eligible for permanent residency, a.k.a. a Green Card. Being married to a US citizen would be one viable path, if the US citizen spouse files a petition and is a viable sponsor for Affidavit of Support purposes. Another path is a doctorate degree or an investment of $1M or more. An indirect path is via an H1-B visa, after 6 years of working in a certain position requiring an advanced university degree.

They have to wait for their family based petition to be served and use that to enter the US. \r\n \r\nFirst of all, you have to understand that a US tourist visa will be denied them at the US embassy in their/your country if they attempt to apply. They will be in the computer or data base so the consul will know that a family based petition is already in process for them. If they already have a tourist visa and would like to come in the US, they will still be inspected at the port of entry. \r\n \r\nThere can only be one way of coming into the U.S. and that is either through a tourist or immigrant visa. Not both are given. Once an immediate family based petition is filed, then that person is already disqualified for a tourist visa.  \r\n \r\nI hope that their petition will arrive soon as you are obviously missing them. Best of luck to your family.          \nIf they apply for a tourist visa, they will be denied. If they already have a multiple entry visa, they will not have a problem (technically they are not supposed to enter on a tourist visa, but in practice they can)          \nI believe that there'll be a chance for them to come as visitor, as long as they are stable financially. Meaning to say, they have a certain amount of money show money. Why don't you seek the advice of immigration lawyer instead?          \nIf you parents are in the middle of the sponsor process, they are not allowed to enter to US until after the petition is approved.  Plus when they find out they have one in process, their visitor visa will be denied.          \nThat is totally under discretion of Immigration Officer at the airport, if they already have Visitors visa. If they have to apply one, the approval of visa is totally under the discretion of Consular officer at US Embassy.  \r\n \r\nAlso, when the interview is scheduled, they must in present at US Embassy in Chennai.

I do not find that it is addressed to 'husbands' and gives them an authority over 'wives' to inflict a punishment for very objectionable behavior on the part of married women in society. for 'beat them' the Arabic word is 'Zaraba'. It has meanings other than 'beating'. This Ayah , hence, is a theological advice to Theologians.          \nI read it in hindi so translator translates the last wordings \" beat them but no bleeding or no bone breaking \" .. that is exceptional case .. nobody is doing such things now days. better to sit and understand each other if both are educated and know how to respect others. but illitrates no other source i think.          \nThank you sis, for trying to explain to them the truth. May Allah (SWT) reward you, Insha'Allah. \r\nThe least they can do is try to understand, if not then at least respect it.  \r\n=)          \nThat is not cool.          \nThere is this obedience thing that I find a bit disturbing - okay, I get the deal that the husband protects his wife, and that the wife should be modest and listen to her husband, it's a given in any adult relationship that partners listen to each other and consider each other's wishes. But adding obedience into the mix suggests that the wife is little better than a child, and also suggests that there is an inequality in the relationship.  \r\n \r\nAs regards beating your wife for disobedience - sorry lads. I don't condone beating anybody when you're annoyed with them, because you're annoyed with them. Then chances are you'll hit harder than you mean to, which means that there is a greater likelihood of injuring them.          \nIt Still allows them to beat there wives.. If they disobey them.. And excuse me.. i dont need no man to protect me.. what is it trying to say that am weak and my man is responsible for me.. Ain't i am my own person.. LIKE AM SOME KIND OF ANIMAL WHO NEEDS A MAN FOR PROTECTION.. i can protect my self thank you.. i aint no child          \nto beat a woman is cowardly,and it shore ain't protecting them          \nSince according to Islam any hitting is to leave no blemish then I don't consider that to be beating.  However, I don't think any man has any right to lay his hands on a woman, whether she is his wife or not, as a means of disciplining her.  That is treating her as property rather than as a life partner.          \ndon't say that there r soft beatings:P, well, how whould a woman know what unfaithfull is if she's not even allowd to enter a muslim church, and I'm a western ( whell European) and I'm not a sex object:P, many times women got killed because they spent time with a man( who is not a part of the family) and didn't discuss this with the family in the same room( I repeat, they only spent time). She was killed by a member of her family, whatever the caes is women shoudn't be ruled by men and they should get the respect that they also can go to church          \nThere is no doubt that Islam advocates \"beating\" of the wife after the prior two steps. But what most people are ignorant of, or tend to ignore, is the Hadeeth whereby the Prophet (S) explained to the Companions how to carry this out. He took a miswak and struck it; that was it. \r\n \r\nBut the truth is, the burden is upon the husband it maintain a good relationship with his wife.

If there was it wouldn't be such a hell hole for so many people.  People should be more tolerant.  It would promote peace instead of war.          \nYou are right, but some things we'll never understand. That's when tolerance is important. Tolerance can get you through until understanding takes place. You know what I mean? Tolerance keeps our mind open to understanding.          \nWell said! \r\n \r\n~~~~~~ \r\nNeo, it's better to be wise about not making assumptions about my beliefs. You couldn't be further from what I believe and what my religion states.          \nThe problem is that most people belong to an abrahamic religion. In those religions (jews, christians, muslims)... each considers itself to be God's true followers, and everyone else is evil. \r\n \r\nAgain, note: most people on the planet are of an abrahamic religion. The best you can do with an abrahamic religion is tell their followers - be tolerant! There is no \"just understand me\"... the only thing they can understand is that they're right, and everyone else is evil for rejecting their religion. \r\n \r\nEDIT: Actually the jews are probably the most \"tolerant\" of the 3... maybe that's why they're so few in number.          \nI think it's a matter of semantics.  What you describe as acceptance, I consider tolerance.  Acceptance would be if I were to engage or participate in other beliefs or activities, in my opinion.          \nTolerance and acceptance are two different things. We don't need to accept everything that's wrong and not to anything about it, but we need to be tolerant towards others and their beliefs...          \nTolerance is what holds a civilized society together. Without it everything falls apart. It is different from acceptance in that we don't have to agree all the time. Look at our governments for example. We don't always like what they do but we wait until we can vote, we don't break up into various camps and go to war. That is tolerance and patience.          \nI think you're exactly right, but that's a little bit utopian, thinking that too many people are going to take the time to understand the people around them.  I have encountered SOME (note that word \"some\") people who are hard pressed to read even their cereal boxes first thing in the morning, never mind the beliefs of others.  They won't be interested enough to do that. \r\n \r\nSo \"tolerance\" is the next most desirable thing to hope for.  No one can argue with the logic that \"if you don't like it, fine, but don't try to stop others from living their lives the way they see fit.\"          \n\"Tolerance would imply that you're putting up with something you dislike or disagree with\" \r\n \r\nYes.  For example Gay sex which I find foul and disgusting even to think of.  Yet I \"tolerate it\".  Why?  Because it is not my bottom and it's none of my business.   \r\n \r\nI find the arguments for tolerance based on \"understanding\" or subjectivity dangerous.  They imply that if a particular moral is not subjective or if you cannot \"understand\" the behaviour you have a right to put an end to it.  You do not, you do not have a right to interfere in others lives.   \r\n \r\nWhat we need to get through to people is not \"truly understanding our fellow planet-dwellers\" but respect.  Each person owns his or herself and, understand it or not, people must respect what they do with their own property.          \nI think people say they are tollerant because it is the in thing.  \r\nThey do it to make themself feel better and how they are perceived towards others. \r\n  \r\nPeople get confused, some say they are tollerent and try to be even towards extremist muslims? But you ask them to listen and except the beliefs of the KKK there is a different story.  \r\n \r\nWhite pride and power groups are the only groups not tollerated.  \r\n \r\nI seen a black panther march, all these white people were cheering at the blacks saying we need to exterminate whites, white man must be eradicated from the earth. I couldn't belive my ears? I thought are you dumb? you are supporting someone who wants genocide on your race? \r\n \r\nAnd at a white pride rally they were all booed when they said we should not be in the war, we should buy american, we need to go back to family values, hard working americans are loosing their jobs to illegal immigrants. \r\n \r\nI guess being tollerent would be good as being blinded by hate, made these people not even listen what the White pride group said. And i know most of them would of agreed if they were not blinded by the  pre conceived notions of the group they had. And as for the black panthers, People were blinded by being seen to support minorities and not actually listening to the msg.  \r\nI cant be tollerent of silly people,but i will try ;)          \nI never though tof it that way, but I like it.          \nI think G 72 hit it square-on.  You have to be willing to tolerate difference before you can attain understanding and acceptance of it. \r\n \r\nI think that a lot of intolerance comes from unfamiliarity.  But a lot of unfamiliarity is not going to go away overnight.          \nLets take a look at homosexuality. Many Christians simply cannot be acceptant due to their religious views. If there would at least be tolerance then there might be progress.  Acceptance is like saying you agree with something but tolerance is like saying I don't agree but I'm not going to attack you. There's things I don't personally agree with but I tolerate becuase there are times when I have to tell myself 'who am I to tell others how to live their lives'. Does that make sense?

{"url": "https://www.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071225164304AAFLsLH", "answer": "\nFirst you have to understand that their inability to feel guilty or ashamed has nothing to do with you. \r\nThen only you understand why you are hurt, they can not feel what you are feeling. \r\nI hope you have told them, that is a must. \r\nThose feelings, released into the air, or given away, either to them or just spoken out loud, takes them from within you. \r\nBe them in your mind just for awhile. Realize all their life's situations that could make them who they are, what could make them act or speak or think the way they do? If you find the hidden reason's, then you must find compassion especially if this person has been terribly hurt themselves.          \nEasier said than done, but I think it's about making peace with the situation for your own peace of mind, completely distinct from where the other person is at.  Perhaps it will help to find a harmless way of expressing your anger - such as by digging the garden, or doing martial arts, or perhaps finding a creative outlet (for example, writing your feelings down in a journal, or painting them).  These, and the passage of time, will ease your feelings.          \nForgiveness is not for the benefit of the forgiven, but for those who forgive.  When you forgive, you are saying that you no longer carry the burden of worrying about what people did to you.  Worrying about the hurt people did to you is a burden to YOU, it may not be to them.  Letting them know that you forgive is a way of telling them that they cannot hurt you because you refuse to let what they do keep you down or hold you back, which is what mulling over the hurt does to you.  In Indian philosophy, that is what is meant by karma.          \nI'm in a situation like that right now.  Practice makes it easier. I'm not being rude here.  I mean it.  I'm not forgiving for them, I'm forgiving for ME.  So I can sleep at night.  So I don't carry bitterness and resentment around.  So I'm in control of my emotions not the other way around.  So they don't have rent free space in my mind.   So I am free to be love in action. \r\nIf I'm not forgiving when I need to be, then I'm as much a part of the problem as this person is right now who gleefully looks for ways to poke and prod at me and knows just how to get at my tender spots.  \r\nThanks for the Q.  I feel a whole lot better that I am not the only one struggling with this right at this moment.  And I'm able in this moment to let it go and forgive it.  \r\nMy stomach thanks you, the knot is gone.  My heart thanks you, now I can just extend love into the situation. \r\nAnd you get a star.  :)  Hope this helps.  Blessings.          \nIt is important to remember that \"Forgiveness\" only takes one person - you. It's reconciliation that would take two. I personally am unable to ignore the hurt and anger when someone hurts me. Emotionally you have to go through that and sometimes it takes a bit longer for my heart to catch up with my mind. Intellectually I'll know that forgiveness sets me free but emotionally I am wounded. For me it also depends on who has hurt me. I had a very dear friend betray me and I was hurt. I made several attempts to rectify these feelings but she kept doing the same thing over and over again never taking responsibility for her behavior and didn't seem to care. She had no remorse for the hurt she caused.  I finally had to realize that I had been avoiding dealing with the loss of the friendship. Once I allowed myself to let go of the relationship I was also able to forgive. We are not friends but I am free from the woundedness that she created. I hope this is helpful and that you will feel the internal freedom of forgiveness in your situation.          \nif these 'actions' have happened in the past , and still continue --- then you seriously need to consider your assocciation with them . in other words you need to ditch them and get on with your life and also make new friends .good luck .          \nDo they know they hurt you? if so, it may be a matter of respect.  It IS OK to get angry, the trick is channeling the anger to positive results.  Being assertive is a way to filter those elements off your life & that's ok.          \nStop being so worried over what is going on in their mind and just get on with your own life. This is your personal journey leave how he feels for him to sort out, he/she is on their own journey.  Just sort out your own feelings without expecting anything from the other person.  If you don't want to forgive them then don't, you don't owe them anything.          \nWell, I would ignore them... \r\nDon't make it your responsibility to forgive them unless they absolutely need to be a good part of your life or heart. \r\n \r\nTaking on the burdens of the world is not good for your heart and esteem, especially if they hurt you again and again. I would just shut off and find better. Ignore them. They are not worth your attention. Forgive yourself, they are not your responsibility.          \nIt would probably be good to accept the fact that they simply don't know what love is and so, its best not to take their actions too personal. It might be best to avoid contacting them whilst that would only make it easier to re-live the pain.However, dont make them your enemy or hold any animosity in your heart towards them. You should also not let this consume your thoughts or prevent you from doing what needs to be done. Perhaps you can occupy yourself in doing things that you love and not let this hurt your esteem. Just remember that time is a healer. \r\nGod bless!          \nThere are people who don't have feelings for other people.  They will rarely, if ever, apolgize for their behavior.  I think it more rational to understand this, rather than to keep expecting everybody to apologize.  You only feel put-upon and hurt and end up being the only one who feels bad.  Understanding, however, that this kind of person rarely, if ever changes, you don't expect considerate behavior from him/her, and therefore, go your own way if you choose!  It might be good if you checked your own feelings out--to see if maybe you are a bit more sensitive to others' behaviors than it is healthy to be.          \nYou don't forgive people like that for your benefit...It is all about you.  The less you care, the less a toll it takes on you.  I of all the people who answer this question know this well...It is hard Kumara - I am not saying it is not - It is not even a fast process...but you have a choice.  You can either live with all that hate eating your beautiful soul alive or learn to forgive... \r\nGood luck.          \nYou don't forgive for the person you are forgiving, you forgive for yourself.  Holding a grudge against anybody for any length of time, does nothing but bring negative energy into your life, and negative energy begets negative experiences.  If you don't forgive, then you are giving that person control over your emotions and your life.  *sm*          \nThats a hard one, but you have to realize that the act of forgiving is actually for your benefit and not for theirs. You will be the on that benefits from forgiving them.........if you are able to see it from this stand point, it really doesn't matter how they react at all. \r\nHate or resentment or feelings of sadness that another cannot \"fess\" up to their wrong doing, is in essence only hurting them, not you. In forgiving them, you will free yourself up. \r\nThis is something my mother told me, and it has stood the test of time: \r\n         \"Hate does more to vessel in which it is stored than unto the vessel upon which it is poured\"...............(not that you necessarily hate the person, but you get the message I'm trying to send) \r\nIf you continue to feel angry towards this person, do you think it matters to them? It doesn't.  It only HURTS you. \r\nSome people never, ever, confess, or apologize, I have a step-mother who treated me terribly as a child, she's still my step mother, and has never acknowledged any wrong doing. \r\nAll I can do is pity her, and the fact that she has not yet reached the level of emotional growth that would allow her to accept responsibility and apologize......that's it's, I just have to let go, otherwise, I hurt me, and frankly it's just not worth it! \r\nMake it about you and your need for peace in your life, you'll be a happier person......and if this someone continues to hurt you, perhaps you should consider avoiding contact with him or her, or just cutting off the relationship all together? I guess it depends on weather the person is a family member or someone you have to see on a regular basis. \r\n....and remember \"forgiveness\" is not just one final act, it is a continuous effort, those feelings may rise back up again, and you will have to start back over again, not always, but just sometimes...... \r\nPeace, \r\nmybelle          \nForgiving is more about ridding yourself of the free rent the hurt is enjoying inside your head than it is about bestowing grace upon the hopeless sinner. \r\n \r\nTherefore, you can just choose to forgive for your own peace of mind and you don't even have to tell anybody about your decision.          \nI have no answer apart from time \r\nTime they will perhaps feel bad \r\nJust stay distant \r\nDon't get in their way if they think they're right but don't let them win either \r\nStay away for a bit and they should be ok \r\nMy sister is like this \r\nShe really does not feel no regret after argument like she does not care, yet I think she cannot help this (?) \r\nI don't know.............          \nThe ball is in your court.  Do forgive them.  You don't have to even  inform them that you have.  Just treat them normally (that might cause them to have  little humility & remorse). You will be teaching by example & will be an inspiration to all. \r\n \r\nMost of all you'll have peace.          \nIf you harbor resentments, it remains with you.  I f you let go and forgive them, it is gone.  So they no longer control you. \r\n \r\nI do not know how religious you are, but for me, what works is saying the \"Our Father\" and when it comes to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, I imagine their face at that moment.  I want to be forgiven my sins and wrong doings, so I forgive even if they acted like you described.          \nWell the best thing for you to do is tell them about it and i know its hard because they don't feel bad at all for what they did/said but it usually works if you tell them your feelings. \r\n \r\namber!* \r\nhope i helped=)          \nOnce you forgive them, the burden of the pain is off you. You don't think so for awhile, but gradually, the heavy soul lightens up, because a grudge remembered re-enacts the crime over and over again. You don't forgive them for their sake, you forgive them for YOUR sake...Karma (hmmm, a lot like your name) is the great equalizer, and will catch up with them....          \nI admit that, to me, forgiving is a very difficult thing to do. Especially when the person that did the bad thing is a person who matters so much to you, a very special and very important person.          \nForgiveness just belong to God. he is the only one who can forgive people actions. \r\n \r\nYou can forget or try to forget (that help the most of people) \r\n \r\nor you can listen to this. \r\n \r\n \r\nthat always help.          \nA person you described is your basic psychopath.  It could be treated, but I suggest you do research to get a better understanding.  Tony Soprano is a classic example.          \nIt doesn't matter if the offender has remorse. Forgiveness is the the gift that you give to yourself. The act of forgiving someone allows YOU to let go of the hurt and negative feelings. What the offender chooses to do about it is up to them.          \nwell first you put a little whip cream on your naughty part!! Then you start to rub it softly, then you start moaning and breathing really loud then your just c.u.m all over the place and you will be happy again!!!          \nI know that it is hard to forgive, butt all you have to do is pray to God and ask to help you and and by forgiving them is being alot better than them.          \nLike everyone has said yes you must forgive, and as you ask how? Well first you must confront the person, tell them what they did to offend you, and you did not appreciate it and that it really hurt you. Give them the opportunity to respond. Most of time if they did/said something bad their response will be something like \"who me, what did I do?\" We all know the type. Anyway if that's the case just say well I guess maybe I should have known better than to expect remorse from you, because if so you may not have done thus and so to start. This is not meant in a mean way but merely explaining your feelings. So from here you've done your part leave it at that, and leave them out of your life, though do pray for them, and also ask God to guide you in your own life. Remember you are not responsible for others actions, nor can you control them, but rather you can only control yourself and your actions!          \nAlot of times, it's a good thing to be angry. It helps you from making the same mistakes by trusting the same people. Truth is, if someone doesn't ask for forgiveness, why should you give it to them.          \nThis is an excellent question that many people have. In order to forgive others, who seem to show no remorse for their actions, you must ask yourself why you wish to forgive them. In most cases, it is to find peace with yourself, or at least that should be the reason. You must stop thinking of holding a grudge as having power over the other person, because in reality, it is their power over you. You obsess over whether or not you should forgive this person, when in reality, they don't really care. So the only person you not forgiving them is affecting is you. Once, you realize this, you can start forgiving because it lifts a weight off of your shoulders, not necessarily the person's shoulders you are forgiving.

If that's your favorite Atmosphere album \nthen sure.  \nPersonally my favorite is When Life Gives You Lemons...but that is their most \npopular and maybe least \"underground\" album.  \nAlso their production style changed on that album, and Slug's lyrical  \ncontent changed also. More storytelling, instead of personal views. \nGod Loves Ugly is probably Atmosphere at their rawest, kinda of a depressing album. \n \n \nSo I guess that may be your reason.  \nI think the aforementioned Deltron and The Cold Vein deserve a spot,  \nso it's tought to say, trying to cover all the aspects \nof underground hip hop here.  \n \nI like the list as it is, actually. \n \nEDIT [2]: \n \nFuncrusher Plus represents probably the most successful independent hip hop \nlabel, Rawkus, and nothing was straightforward. One of the most unique \nalbums, and one of the deepest. Epitomizes how hip hop is so much denser than other \ngenres. I think Innercity Griots was a better album than To Whom it May Concern. \n \nThen you also have to represent the aspect of the underground that is kind of  \nattacking what's wrong with hip hop nowadays. The Listening would cover \nthat void I would feel. Masters of the Universe could do the same thing. \n \nA Prince among Thieves > A Piece of Strange \n \n@Trylemma: What was the influence of Blazing Arrow? \n \nIf Donuts is selected then you have a debate about instrumental hip hop albums \n \nOkay, I see, I see \n \nNo further questions          \nI agree with most of those choices, I'd probably add 'The Best Part' by J-Live and 'Masters of the Universe' by Binary Star          \nMost Important \"Underground\" Hip Hop Albums Of All Time..... hmmm. If you wouldn't have said MOST important, it would have been easier to write down ten, but one that comes to mind is the Geto Boys 1991 album called We Can't Be Stopped. It's the album that put Texas on the map along with the Rap-A-Lot record label. This album is underground for it not getting massive exposure on the radio for its explicit-heavy-lyrical content, except for the song Mind Playing Tricks on Me and yet did very well. Keep in mind this is the early 90's where the internet did not exist to get massive publicity to the whole world, but they managed to get props. They got some exposure, but very less comparing to groups like ATCQ and so on.... \n \n@ Try... Wait so you're making a top ten only.... Dayum I thought you wanted to add to those. Anyway kinda hard though but I'll say Below The Heavens - Blu & Exile because it's a relatively recent album to have made a GREAT impact yet. It's good but not top ten worthy for now. On another note Funcrusher Plus is a must on the list in my opinion because it encapsulated what NY underground hip-hop was at the time and before that there wasn't any album that can be truly considered abstract prior to that, specially on lyrics. It redefined a new era of underground hip-hop.... \n \n \nGood post mayne. The section needs more of this....          \nI would put Dr. Octagon in instead of Deltron.  It was doing all the same stuff 4 years earlier. I would have Quality Control instead of Blazing Arrow, too.  I know you're never going to pull a Blackalicious album off a list, though. \n \nI don't know how I feel about APOS being on a list of \"most important.\"  Not sure what I'd put on instead.  Maybe Mystic Stylez? \n \nBlack Star is only borderline underground. I like the idea of an Organized Konfusion album here. \n \nCritical Beatdown is another one to consider. \n \nOG Loc makes a valid point about including both Cold Vein and Funcrusher. \n \nNot trying to say Deltron isn't influential, but I'd have a hard time including both Deltron and Dr. Octagon on a list like this and, honestly, I think without Dr. Octagon there is no Deltron. \n \nI guess I'm kind of reading (or misreading)  \"most important\" as \"most influential.\"  Which is why I think Mystic Stylez deserves a spot.  I mean, as a mid-90's southern album, it scores automatic influence points, it's also one of the earliest notable horrorcore albums, and launched Three 6.  Who effectively popularized crunk and trap by themselves.  For better or worse, Mystic Stylez is a hugely influential album.  I would definitely say more so than APOS, Below the Heavens or Blazing Arrow.          \nSolid list. Masters Of The Universe is a must though....and I think Scorpion Circles is another (stan but whatever). And something by J-Live too is a must in reality. What to take off? I'll get hate for this, but A Piece Of Strange, it wouldn't make my top 20 underground albums, if we're talking concept albums there are plenty to replace it. A Prince Among Thieves for example....And is it necessary to have both The Cold Vein and Funcrusher Plus? Funcrusher is essential for obvious reasons and I hate to throw off The Cold Vein but both on the same list....eh I don't know.....Imaginarium by L*Roneous too should be on it....and something like Koolmotor or Fantastic Vol. 2 for dopeasfuck production. All suggestions though..... \n \nEDIT: Just to add on something, it's nearly necessary to have something by Dilla on this sorta list....you know?? \n \nEDIT2: Lol yah I kinda forgot about essential when dropping Scorpion Circles....I'm still feeling strongly about APAT. For the concept, skits...I think it's been a bigger influence than APOS but whatever. What about Violent By Design by JMT?? I haven't seen it mentioned and is at least worth considering...and something in the whole political/conspiracy field....Lets Get Free, The 911 Report....or hell even Rev Vol. 2? Again suggestions... \n \nOn a lighter note, props for this thread. By far the best thread in months.... \n \nEDIT3: I'm biased towards Innercity Griots too but I think it is essential. If not definitely, some Project Blowed album, most likely something by Acey...and Blazing Arrow is another essential. In regards to The Unseen I don't know...you've got Madvillainy there for Stones Throw and if you're throwing in Donuts too...it'd be either Donuts or The Unseen but the Dilla factor is enormous really.... Another consideration, The Ugly Truth by Prolyphic & Reanimator. The whole emo wave? Maybe replacing APOS...Oh and one that just struck me is 93 Til Infinity....          \nI'm not sure if this album actually counts but what about Soul Food by Goodie Mob?          \nOff the top of my head i can think of: \r\n \r\nBlack On Both Sides- Mos Def \r\nEnter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)- Wu-Tang Clan \r\nThe Infamous- Mobb Deep \r\n \r\nHope this helped!          \nEver considered the uk underground scene?.
