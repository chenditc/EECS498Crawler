	{'answer': u'\nDaft Punk; they took electronic music and modified it into something both soulful and electronic. Thus making it pop music.          \nThere are ton of artists that have marked the history of the music,  \nlike Neil Young, Les Paul \nThose two have made a difference in the music. \n \nFor example: Les Paul was the first one to plug an electric guitar and he could make a system where you could record one instrument at the time when all the band had to play at the same time to record the song  \nNeil Young practically created a new genre and he is called the godfather of the Grunge          \nThe answer to that question will depend on the age of the responder.  Elvis & the Beetles have long been touted as the greatest of ALL time; yet both of them were influenced by somebody else that I\'ve never heard of!!!  Personally, I love Stevie Ray Vaughan & he stated that he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix; yet, I don\'t care much for Hendrix\'s music!!!  Michael Jackson was also known to be a great talent; but he\'s another who didn\'t appeal to me!!!  My Grandmother was a huge Frank Sinatra fan; but we don\'t hear much of his music unless Michael Buble is on the air.  Buble is know for being a good artist...NOT a great artist.  Generations taste in music change from one to the next; so, I\'m NOT convinced that there is any ONE person who I\'ve ever heard of that has had the MOST impact!!!  IF I had to pick ONE, I would say it was the very FIRST person who ever sang the first song because their influence spread from there until now!!!          \nI hate to say this but Justin Beiber has had a massive influence. If not on music, then on how the up and coming generation sees it. The amount of screaming 9 year olds that know everything about him but not Freddie Mercury seem to be the majority. It\'s not a good thing, but that\'s the way the media wants to sell it. \n \nIt will probably bring about temporary death of good music until there\'s another music rebellion like in the 1950\'s.          \nNiccol\xf2 Paganini. \nLike a lot of classical musicians, he lived in a music world where everything was about music. Therefore able to create impressive fingerings on the violin rather than just following traditional ways of fingering.  \n \nBut a lot of the older classical musicians were impressive. Their works lasted centuries and will continue to last for a very long time.          \nAfter considerable thought and eliminating several contenders, my opinion is that J\xa0S\xa0Bach may have had the greatest influence.\xa0 He developed counterpoint virtually single-handedly from its crude predecessors.\xa0 He solved all the basic problems in composition, and modern composers, in the first years after they learn their craft, frequently turn to Bach to "see how he did it". \n \nHe\'s largely responsible even for how we tune our instruments to make complex music playable.\xa0 Previously, the pitches in the tuning system were based on simple ratios devised by ancient Greeks, called "just intonation", which allowed playing in single keys.\xa0 For example, an instrument tuned for C would sound fine played in that key, but unpleasant played in E. \n \nFor wind and non-fretted sting instruments, where adjusting pitch is possible, the players eliminate the problem.\xa0 For fixed-fret and keyboard instruments, however, this is not option, and retuning is necessary to play in another key. \n \nBach championed "equal temperament" tuning, in which notes are tuned very slightly lower or higher than just intonation would call for, evenly distributing the tuning discrepancies to make possible all keys on fixed-pitch instruments. \n \nThese pitch adjustments are built into electronic instruments, and accomplished on guitar and similar instruments by relocating the frets very slightly from their "ideal Greek" single-key placements.\xa0 Without equal temperament, modern pop and classical music is simply not practicable\xa0\u2014\xa0you could play it, but you wouldn\'t want to hear it.          \nPatti and Mildred J. Hill, the composers of the melody for "Happy Birthday to You".          \nBritish Invasion, 80\'s New Wave/Punk, then rap... There\'s alot. Depending on time and opinion.          \n\u3000 Now you did ask of Musician only, not plural, or bands or groups, and that changes some attributes to whom we think is our favorite, to who may be most well known attributed artists in the field,  \n \n\u3000 What we miss out on overall , is someone like Beethoven, where without many a written song by him has been keyed upon many thereafter,  \n \nLudwig van Beethoven \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 Thereafter, It would then be individuals alike Elvis and Micheal Jackson,  \n \nElvis Presley \n \nMicheal Jackson,  \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 The list can be longer than any one individual applicable, even unknowns to us from other parts of the world,  \n \nGlenn Miller , Lawrence Welk , Paul McCartney, Elton John,  \nEric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Bob Marley, ... \n \n..          \nMany people consider Paul McCartney the most successful artist of all time, due to the level of popularity his songs co-written with John Lennon have achieved, as well as the amount of singers who have covered his song \'Yesterday\', though many would perhaps stick with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, all of them popular in their day and nowadays.          \nObviously the honor should probably go to one of the early classical composers.  However, unless you are a musical historian it would be difficult and too far removed from recent history for the average person to contemplate.  In recent time I would have to say Elvis Presley, even though there are many musicians whom I prefer.  The majority of people within the past half-decade listened to either rock, country, jazz or gospel.  Elvis was the first to take the fledgling genre of rock and combine it with elements of most other genres.   He was among the first to use electric guitar within his band as the backbone to his music.  He was definitely the first  musician of high popularity to incorporate energized movements into his performance.  He also had a wide appeal to people of varying race and musical taste.   Almost all subsequent rock or pop musicians cited him as among their earliest influence.   Twenty years from now most of the nation\'s or world\'s populace won\'t know a clue about current names on the charts.  However, I am certain that even a century and more from now Elvis will still be known (and he might even still have a few \'impersonators\' in Vegas.)       \n \nElvis:  the very first rock-n-roll \'star\'          \nMichael Jackson, thats all i have to say.          \nOwl City  \nEDIT: 4 dislikes? what do people have against Adam? His music is amazing.  \n          \nScott Joplin had the most impact on popular music as a whole. He was one of the first musicians to incorporate syncopation into music. Doctors of the late 1800s and early 1900s thought syncopation was unhealthy and could cause irregular heart palpitations. Obviously that was proved wrong. \n \nThere\'s no popular song today without some syncopation in it. Scott Joplin (also known as the "King of Ragtime") wrote many famous rags that many people could recognize today, like "Maple Leaf Rag" and "The Entertainer." Ragtime gave rise to Jazz, which gave rise to Rock and Roll, which gave rise to Hip Hop, which gave rise to 99% of today\'s popular music. \n \nIn my opinion, Scott Joplin is the unsung hero of popular music.          \nElvis Presley.He brought people together.He helped to transform basic blues and gospel music and took it to the masses.He had one of the best voices in history.A remarkable vocal range. \nMost of all he made it believable that a kid from an ordinary background could make it.A huge influence on virtually every pop/rock artist since.          \nHiphop now some hiphop I hate. Snoopdog some of his songs are cool. Hiphop express all types of feelings anger, happy, sad, and etc.          \nGive me thumbs down, but i like one direction...          \nJimi Hendrix but I have to agree with LadyMarisaa too          \nMy favourite solo artist is Michael Jackson as far as I\'m concerned nobody can or will ever touch his vocal ability or his stagecraft he (in my opinion) was the greatest solo artist ever. As for favourite band there are so many bands that i love to choose from but i have to say Guns N Roses (1986-1996 line-ups) they were the first band i heard when i actually started listening to music when i was about 5 years old and I first heard "Welcome to the Jungle" and I was hooked been a gunner ever since and will be till i die (now that\'s devotion lol)          \ndefintly michial jackson          \n3pac \n \n \n \nHe doesn\'t give a hoot.          \nWhen you consider music it would largely rule out people like Elvis and Michael Jackson as they are not predominantly musicians - singers, performers, entertainers. \n \nFor a real answer I would pick someone like Antonio Stradivarius for making violins which hundreds of years later are still individually and collectively considered to be the greatest instruments ever made. \nOther than him the great composers like Beethoven whose music is still played today and have inspired great music still being produced for movies today. \nI like the other answerer who said J.S. Bach. \n \nFor more modern influences on music I would pick someone like Elvis or John Lennon.          \nI\'m going to have to go with the classical musicians, specifically the likes of Beethoven and Pachelbel.          \nI\'ll name a few: \nJohnny Cash, Bob Marley, and Gordon Lightfoot. \n \nGordon Lightfoot because his talent of writing songs has inspired my ability to be able to do that. \n \nBob Marley because his music reached deep into my roots to re-aquaint me of my black heritage and struggles. \n \nJohnny Cash because like Marley, his music created a lot of social consciousness in me, plus when I was a kid and I was suffering from a lot of deep problems, listening to Johnny Cash\'s prison songs really helped me so I can learn about the meaning of redemption from living the low life.          \nThe answer above about J.S. Bach championing the equal temperament tuning is a really good one, but to confine my answer to modern times I would say Phil Spector. Better known as a producer, he was a musician first, so I think he still qualifies.  \n \nOver his career he produced songs and albums for some big pop acts such as The Ronnettes, Tina Turner, The Beatles Let It Be album, The Ramones, John Lennon, Leonard Cohen, and The Righteous Brothers. \n \nNot only was the sound he brought to these songs hugely influential, he is a source of some really wild stories of what takes place behind the scenes in the music industry.          \nBackstreet Boys \n \nThey influenced boy bands to give it a shot. One Direction could have been dumb if BSB didn\'t create this boy band madness. And their harmonization is excellent.          \nJustin Bieber and One Direction! <33333333 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665          \nI especially agree with Me2 and teandbikkies.  \nHowever there is one that is over looked. This is the one that brought the magical reverbarations of the electric base guitar into the souls of young people in the early 50\'s. Others had great acts and music, but Duane Eddy (Artistic Name) Whailed out with what was till then only a minor undeveloped instrument.          \nSome bands that have greatly influenced music: \n \n1. The Beatles \n2. Elvis \n3. Jimi Hendrix   \n4. Stevie Ray  \n5. Eric Clapton \n6. Queen \n6. Alice in Chains \n7. Pearl Jam                        \n8. Stone Temple Pilots \n9. Ray Charles \n10. Little Richard \n11. Bob Dylan \n12. The Rolling Stones \n13. Bob Marley \n14. Led Zepplin  \n15. Pink Floyd \netc.  \n \nSome of these artist were true pioneers and creators of Rock n Roll, Grunge, Reggae, etc. \nThese bands are LEGENDS forever their names written in gold. To all the clueless people: \nDaft Punk and One Direction are far from legends, never will be, and can\'t hold a candle to these artists. No offense, but such a comment is so off the mark it\'s laughable.  \n \nThese artists created music for the sake of music. Not a quick buck. They didn\'t pander to the music industries, or the population. They made music straight from the heart and soul. Passion, Aggression, Emotion, that is music.          \ndefintly michial jackson          ',

	 'question': u"\n    My left foot is really hurting! I can't remember how I did it, I just know that I was complaining to one of the guys I work with last weekend that my foot was hurting \n \nI work 6 days a week, and a minimum of 35 hours a week. I'm always on my feet, sometimes for 10 or 13 hour shifts. But I've done this job for just over a year now, so I don't think it'd be anything to do with being on my feet a lot, because it's never hurt before...   \n \nBut I can't remember doing anything bad to it for it to even start hurting! \n \nIt's on the top of my foot, in the middle, near to my toes. I can feel it hurting when I flex it... \nI can still walk on it, but it hurts. And people have commented that I've started limping when I walk.. \nI drive too, so depending on how I've positioned my foot on the clutch (ie, using the ball off my foot to press down on the clutch), I feel a sharp pain through it.  \n \nIt seems to hurt the most when I first get out of bed in the morning. I do find it very difficult to walk on for about 30 minutes, until I get used to it hurting!!  \n \nWhat could be causing it to hurt like this? And is it likely to stop hurting any time soon?!  ",

	{'answer': u"\nWhat colour is your pee? It needs to be the colour of white wine, if it's like unmilked tea, then you're not getting enough fluids and that's the reason for your headaches. \n \nYour eye tests and glasses should be free. Go and get those sorted and see if a new pair of specs helps. They can also be a cause of headaches. \n \nEither way, if symptoms persist, see your GP who's far better trained in these matters than random strangers on the internet.          \nFirst of all, I've never heard of headaches and periods being medically linked so that is probably the least likely to happen. If you've been on your lap-top a lot that could be a big possibility because eye-strain can cause headaches. I would lay off the lap-top for a bit and see if that helps. Also, make sure you are drinking plenty of liquids like water because dehydration can cause headaches as well. Another thing you may want to look into is getting your eyes checked. When was the last time you had an eye exam?? Frequent headaches can sometimes signal that you need new or stronger eye-glasses because you are straining your eyes if your not wearing your glasses or contacts. These are all possibilities. I wish you luck!          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I'm a 13 year old girl and for the past 2 weeks I've had an on and off headache and it's so annoying! For all of the week so far it's been in the left side of my head but today it's on the right side. I don't feel sick at all or have any other symptoms, and I haven't started my periods yet but I think I will soon and I was just wondering if that would be related to it? I've had a headache like this before a few months ago and that was caused by stress as I have anxiety. There are a few things I'm worrying a bit at the moment but not enough to give me a headache I don't think? I have been on my laptop recently and my mum thinks that's the cause, but I'm not sure. An ideas what the cause is? Oh and i can't take paracetamol, and I'm allergic to calpol so I'm not taking anything to ease the pain and I don't intend to so please don't tell me to just take pain killers and get on with it.  Thank you  ",

	{'answer': u"\nDo you have an SOS or Brillo pad?   Stuff it into the hole.  The pads are made of metal and no mouse in his right mind would chew on that.    Fixed.          \nFill the hole with steel Wool and the mouse cant get in, In the meantime report it to your Landlord.          \nThe mouse is after food. And if you are providing any sort of food for it, it is your problem, especially if you are in a single-family dwelling. That is not to suggest that your landlord should not help you address the problem, but that you need to address the first-cause as well. If you see one mouse, you have many. If you are in a multi-family situation, they could be coming from anywhere including the outside.  \n \nLive traps are best, kill traps second best, glue traps after that. DO NOT use poisons as they are equally toxic to children, pets, and animals that might prey on mice including cats, dogs, owls, ferrets, hawks, foxes, raccoons, badgers and any of several other creatures. A mouse can go through a hole that is 13mm square - pretty small. By excluding one hole they will make another or flank the one. So elimination is the primary removal method. Be scrupulously clean, leave nothing they can eat (including hand soap), and use traps. Bait them with peanut-butter or a combination of sweet chocolate and peanut-butter (they mostly ignore cheese), and ideally get a cat. We are in an area with a lot of mice, all our neighbors (without cats) have mice - we have two cats and no mice.  \n \nGood luck with it.          \nCaulk around your house.  Check your rubber gasket under your door.  Under your kitchen sink cut some aluminum flashing material.  Take 2 pieces of aluminum, mark the openings where it will slide past the hot and cold water lines and the drain.  If it fits well then use it as a pattern to slide over the existing flashing.  tack in place.  Caulk around it.  Do the same in the bathroom sink.  If you have crawl space go under your house and cover the openings for your drain and hot and cold water pipes.  If your dryer vent is low to the ground get a vent box or elevate your vent.  You can buy these at Home Depot.  They are aluminum stack.  Removable for cleaning out lint.  If you have a walkout basement they are coming in under the door first.  I know this isn't an easy job but it is well worth it.  Your house will be mice proof.  There are professionals who do this for a stiff price but the home-owner can do this themselves.  I have done 2 houses and both have never had a mouse in their houses.  It would surprise you how big of a hole in the floor for a bathtub.  Jo Ann          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I kept hearing noises in the kitchen but could never see anything, until one day I saw a mouse in there. It bolted straight through a hole in the wall of our pantry and disappeared. I'd never noticed this hole before and discovered the hole leads to the outside.  \nMy flat is usually clean and tidy but I live above a restaurant and so I'm concerned about this becoming a recurring problem, or that the mouse may get into the flat permanently.  \nI definitely have something on the roof as well because I hear scurrying above my bedroom a LOT. My landlord says he has always spent a lot of money on rat poison to solve this (he owns the restaurant).  \n \nIs it up to my landlord or me to fix the hole in the wall? Or is this a mouse problem that needs addressing separately?  ",

You should resist her effort to save money on this - it\'s one of those times where "cheap" could cost lives, and it\'ll be too late to regret it afterwards. \n \nThe requirements of Part P of the Building Regulations mean that only a certain very limited range of jobs may be done by a "do-it-yourself" person.

The whole thing will take around 2 to 2.5 hours plus the testing time (around 20 minutes), plus registration costs, and VAT. So a charge of about \xa3350 or so is probably well within the range that should be expected. The \xa3550 quote is on the high side.

	{'answer': u"\nthe correct process should be as follows \n First Step:  Plug a  single computer to the second Router (make sure that the computer is configured to obtain DHCP automatically from the Router), change the IP address of the Router so that it's in the same subnet as the main Router (the one that is connected to the Internet Modem); give it an IP that doesn\u2019t conflict with the main router's base IP address, or the DHCP server range.  This will ensure that you can reach the admin server of the old router from any LAN machine, and that the Wireless Clients IPs are assigned correctly. \n \nExample: \n \n- Main Router\u2019s base address is 192.168.1.1, with a DHCP server range of 192.168.1.100  to 192.168.1.150 \n \n- Set the Cable/DSL Router to (the one you're using as an Access Point) base address to any IP address between 192.168.1.151 to 192.168.1.250  \n \nSecond Step:  Switch Off the DHCP on the Wireless Cable/DSL Router, and set to Off any filters or special settings that is On if it is used as the main Router. \n \nPlug the Wireless Router to the main Router. Regular Port to Regular Port, using crossover cable (or straight patch if one port is an Uplink). \n \n The WAN input of the Wireless Router should stay open.  \n \n  Do not connect any thing to the WAN input. \n \nThe LAN\u2019s computers (wired or wireless) should get the IP from one Router only.    \n \nIf  DHCP in on one Router make sure that it  set to provide amount of IPs  that totals the whole system. \n \nThe second Router has to act as a passive switch. \n \nThe result of this arrangement will be a wired Network with wired ports equal to the sum of the two Routers ports \u2013 2, (i.e. two Routers with 4 ports each will yield 6 available wired ports), and a Wireless capacity. \nHTH \nDavid          ",

Then in class the other day, he sat next to me and kept flirting with the girl who was sitting at the other side of him and then every so often, he would disrupt the class and play loud music so everyone would turn round and look at him. He also kept leaning forward in his chair and doing this weird stretch and then when he stretched, he would look at my face with the same smirk. I\u2019m sick of it.

	{'answer': u"\nBeing that you are only 14, by answering this question on how to get drunk would result in the answerer getting criminal charges if you get drunk and do something stupid. you are underage. The simple fact that you are asking this question up here shows that you are not mature enough to be drinking in the first place          \nYou'll be fine dude. People have different thresholds when it comes to getting drunk; some need more, some need less. Just drink slowly and don't rush it.  \n \nAlso, if you're drinking spirits, it'll be best to drink with mixers (lemonade/coke/etc) to take the edge of the raw taste of alcohol- and to also stop you from doing shots of alcohol every 5 minutes.  \n \nAnd yes, your mum will probably notice something is going on because you guys will become very relaxed and loud. I wouldn't advise doing it in your house unless your mum is very cool with it (this means asking her so it's your choice). Personally, I'd do it somewhere else. \n \nLast but not least, have a good time! Remember, take it slow.          \nBeing drunk is nice if you do it with friends. The joy is basicly that you care less about anything. You will only trow up  when you drink alot which you aren&#x27;t planning on doing. I dont know the percentage but i&#x27;m assuming 20. Vodka is a *****  though.. 4 small glasses of vodka or like 3 glasses of whiskey though it really depends on the percentage and the tolerability of the person so it&#x27;s not certain. Good luck and enjoy!          \nif you must drink , drink beer  @ 14 2-4 should do it ... \n \nif you got the vodka and whiskey from your mums drinks cabinet make sure you top it back up with water .....if they start to suspect things  \n \nwhat you must realize is when you get drunk , you become loud ... the chances are if your smashed on vodka or whiskey which is a spirit ( and not recommended for young people  ) ... you are going to be LOUD and falling off the bed  , laughing , talking loudly and generally being a d!ck ....which will see your mum or dad get out of bed ...mums and dads are not stupid they will realize  what your doing  \n \n@ 14 , i always said i was staying over someone  else's house and he would say he was staying at another friends house ... then you go camping  ( the bigger the group the better and more secure , but must be away from people ) .... drink beer and don't get caught  \n \nif you drink , in an evening down the park etc chances are your mum and dad will know........ as they can see glazed eyes and also you will act differently ...not to mention the smell of booze and fags on you \n \nedit: the easiest way of getting caught is to be reckless , smashing up things thinking its funny  , abusing people ..... don't bother other people !!!!          \nNEVER mix white spirit (vodka) with dark spirit (whiskey) \nYou will start to feel tipsy after one or two small glasses...NOT full ones. \n \nActually what you intend doing is pretty stupid. You will probably end up being sick and making a complete idiot of yourself. Being drunk is not clever or adult.          \nWait a couple years. Not only because of your age and physique, but common sense! \nDoing this while your mother is asleep tells me she wouldn't approve. How do you think \nshe would react to seeing you passed out, or worse when she wakes up in the morning? \n \nNo matter what the law says to plan on getting drunk at 14 shows an incredible lack of  \nresponsibility and maturity.

	{'answer': u'\ndon\'t worry          \nMaybe the people who upload the content to peer servers would be liable. It\'s only really the websites that have torrent files that get caught. I\'ve been torrenting music, movies and software (not games) for years and I\'ve never had anything.          \nWorry more about viruses.  TV shows you missed, sure that is good.  Programs, never.  That is just asking for trouble.  The program might be intact but possibly not.          \nWell, it depends where you live. But you also need to understand how they can catch you. Usually, companies that were designed to do this, (like Canipre) start seeding/downloading the torrent along with you and they take all the IP addresses that show up. Then, they present them to the company plaintiff whose copyright was breached and it depends on the company whether they want to put charges. It is easy to get caught because your IP address isnt hidden at all. It is a public information that anyone could get access to. You leave a footprint at every website and place that you visit online \n \nIf you are in the States, your *** will be kicked very hard. It will hurt a lot because t As much as I read, they have those group lawsuits that sue group of people at once. Corporations make lots of money out of that kind of stuff because people can\'t possibly defend themselves. I don\'t think there was a cap, so they could sue you for lots, I mean lots.  \n \nI Canada the laws are different, because it is said that an IP address does not identify the person who is using your internet. Since it could be you, your mom or your neighbor who hacked into your router, there\'s no way to determine who is the one breaking the law. This is why "innocent until proven guilty".

Apart from music producing software that I'm gunna buy asap, anyway I'm still worrying! Can I still get caught even though I've deleted basically everything!

	{'answer': u'\nYou must go to a shop.          \nYou are 21 so go for it if you have thought about it and really want to get one. I\'m sure your parents will be ok with it even if they freak out alittle seeing it for the first time. \nAfter all its not like you woke up one morning and said screw it I\'m tattooing my face.          \nIf it&#x27;s something that you want to do then do it. Put a lot of thought into what you want to get though, because once you actually have it it&#x27;s a totally different thing, and if you hate it a few years from now you&#x27;re either just gonna have to deal with it or get it lasered off but it&#x27;s really pricy!          \nI honestly think you should just get it. If you talk to them they will tell you no and may be upset. It&#x27;s not hard to hide the tattoo and chances are your friends will like your tattoo and may want one. Tattoos aren&#x27;t a bad thing, at all! If you want one get one, warning though they are truly addictive, you will want another          \nI hate tattoos. I\'m a parent, my stepdaughter who is now 26 got a tattoo on her ankle when she was 21. \n \nIt\'s not the end of the world, we still roll our eyes whenever we see it, but it doesn\'t make us love her any less. \n \nInking is a state of mind. You say you\'re not doing it to rebel, which is a good job because you\'ll have it for the rest of your life. Your parents don\'t have that mindset, so you can\'t expect them to understand. I still don\'t, but my stepdaughter loved her ankle tat enough to get another done on her shoulder. \n \nI say go for it. Gauge the reaction before admitting anything, and if you don\'t think it\'s going well, tell them you got really drunk and it was there the day after; and it could have been worse because "Bob" got a dotted line with "cut here" around his neck. \n \nUse a reputable parlour - if they would have offered food which you\'d decline for sanitary reasons, you really don\'t want them sticking needles in your arm.          \nI\'ll be honest, I think you should wait it out a bit, maybe it\'s a phase.... wait a few months, see if in that time you still want it. If you just do it on a whim, you might later regret it. You say you used to hate them and now suddenly, you like them? What changed?  \nAlso, I don\'t think this is a matter of your parents, because they will love you no matter what. My mom hated tattoos and was 100% against them. The day I got my first one, she told me she was disappointing in me. Now, she accepts my tattoos and is even considering getting one of her own.  \nI\'m not saying don\'t get it, I\'m saying be 100% sure before you do it. Not for your parents but for you. Also, if you decide to do it, make sure you check out your artist\'s work and that the tattoo parlor is clean. Can\'t be too picky when choosing where you\'ll get it. Good luck!          ',

In memory she got three cat skulls on her thigh with floral accents around them. It was really beautiful. If getting a dog skull is a little too morbid for you, you could always get a portrait of the dog itself (though that might be spendy and you'd have to find the right artist) or maybe a simple little tattoo of her tag, if she wore one. You could also just get a paw print and add in some interesting accents like text (Girls Best Friend?) or flowers or something that reminds you of your doggy.

However, tattooing your body with any tattoo is not going to serve you well over time.  A lot of employers don't like to see tattoos on people, so it could cost you a job you want down the line (would your former dog want that, for you to miss out on a job you wanted because of a tattoo in his honor?  No).  The other Thing is that tattoos change color over time and--ugh--I've seen some that really look awful. \n \nJust don't do it.

Save a little of your dog's hair if you wish, and put it in a locket or memorial jar to remember your dog by. \n \nWe ourselves did a ceremony to spread our dogs' ashes in the back of the yard, where she used to run back and forth along the fence to bark at the deer.

It doesn't have to be the obvious black and grey realism kind of portrait, you could get a stylised, full colour new school rendering of her.

Contrast is very important with tattoos as the ink spreads as they age so they loose some definition. That can be a problem if there wasn't a whole lot of definition to begin with. I would recommend the feather having a decent outline and having the colours splashing through it and into the background.

	{'answer': u"\njj          \nInbox her and say happy birthday, if you leave it a day it will look like you have forgotten which you clearly haven't :-), good luck!!          \nJust post &#x27;happy birthday&#x27; on her wall. Everybody does it so it won&#x27;t be out of the ordinary. I wouldn&#x27;t send her a message.          \nI inbox my male friends happy birthday all the time, I wouldn't think it weird.  Go for it!          \nPut it on her timeline. If you're more worried about the other guy then you don't like her as much as you think you do. \n \nIf you want to say anything more personal, put it in a pm.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Basically it is a girl\'s birthday who I "like-like". On Facebook,as I couldn\'t go to church and wish it there, I want to say "happy birthday".  \nThe problem is I don\'t want another guy to see it as he will joke about it. I know most people post happy birthday messages on someone\'s wall , so would it be unusual to inbox her it? \nAlso, should I only do it when she is online? \nOr shall I just leave it- possibly wish it to her another day? \n \nExtra info: I liked her profile pic she put up yesterday and it\'s late evening where we are from. \n \nThis probably sounds silly to you, but thanks in advance  ',

I incredibly like people like Deadmau5, KnifeParty, Delta Heavy and Nero but I am struggling to find others like them; so it would be great if someone could give me a huge list of similar artists. I dont mind the occasional 2-4 word lyric that most electronic music has, but anything over that generally means that my brain will start to cry, unless it's very good in which case I will dare to try it. \n \nThank you very much for any suggestions, and sorry for ranting ;D  ",

	{'answer': u'\nKurt Cobain... im not a Kurt fanatic but i think countless musicians of today have been influenced by him. \r\n \r\nB1 - Sandlot \r\nB2 - I wish, but no \r\nB3 - Baby i Love your way          \nIf Freddie Mercury never existed Mika would never have released a record! lol \r\n \r\n \r\nBA.  Back To The Future \r\nBA2. I can\'t see you but I believe you\'re there :-) \r\nBA3. I Want You To Want Me          \nJanis Joplin.  I think she brought issues to the forefront of her generation as a woman.  Rock had long been a man\'s world.  I love old movies and my favorite is "Splendor in the Grass".  Yes, I have faith in things I cannot see.  "I Want You to Want Me".          \nMuddy Waters-created Blues, which Rock evolved out of \r\nChuck Berry-Created Rock \r\nElvis-the biggest rock star at his time who made rock music become widespread \r\nThe Beatles-Obviously a huge influence for rock musicians \r\nJimi Hendrix- redefined what could be done with a guitar, and he invented hard rock.   \r\nBlack Sabbath-the creators of metal \r\nNirvana-brought grunge and alternative into the mainstream.   \r\n \r\nBut Chuck Berry made the biggest impact since he created the entire genre.   \r\n \r\nBQ: Indiana Jones movies (Indy IV was the biggest disappointment ever) \r\nBQ 2: Yes I do because I feel it in other ways.   \r\nBQ 3: I want you to want me          \nHey Nance! \r\n \r\nThe impact John Lennon has made on musicians to this day is extrodinary. And its not just "soft" rock that is influenced by him... anything from metal artists to global music has been in some way or another touched by John Lennon. \r\n \r\nBA: I can\'t think of anything now its 3am \r\nBA2: Yes \r\nBA3: I Want You To Want Me          \nPaul McCartney - spelled right? \r\nHard to predict but it would be profound. \r\n \r\n1-Cobra \r\n2-God - yes - walking through the forest in the dark with no flashlight-no. \r\n3-I want you to want me  \r\n \r\nHey nancy, Would you care to check out my question? \r\n          \nthat is not poss-able to answer from the Ramon\'s to beatles to black sabbath they have ,did ,and will influence many bands. i don\'t have faith in what i see so what i don\'t see is impossible. frampton trick is a tie          \nIts not so much one person as a series of bands \r\n \r\nJohnny Cash, BB King-stripped down blues and country enough to be eventually made into rock \r\n \r\nChuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Elvis Presely-nuff said \r\n \r\nThe Who-opened the way for harder rock, no Who, no metal or Punk \r\n \r\nLed Zeppelin-further opened the door for metal \r\n \r\nBlack Sabbath-created metal\'s unique sound \r\n \r\nPink Floyd, Yes, King Crimson, Rush, The Beatles-Encouraged other musicians to do out of the ordinary things in their music. \r\n \r\nNirvana-Brought alternative (modern) rock into the mainstream \r\n \r\nAll modern bands-made what the previous musicians did into generic boring music.          \nJimi Hendrix. He changed the guitar, and was an incredibke singer and lyricist. \r\n \r\nBQ: Hercules. I loved that movie. \r\nBQ2: Depends. \r\nBQ3: Uhhh...          \nElvis. \r\n \r\nI hate that things were so divided upon racial lines during that time period, but he was the first to cross those and infuse blues into modern mainstream music and help it be accepted by a population who didn\'t listen to it.  Rock is anchored in blues.  Without him music would have likely taken another path all together. \r\n \r\nbq - goodness...I really liked Kiss Meets the Phantom a lot before I saw Dune.... \r\n \r\nbq2 - Not usually \r\n \r\nbq3 - Baby I Love Your Way - Frampton oh yeah...          \nThe Beatles \r\nThe Rolling Stones \r\nThe Ramones/Sex Pistols (created punk) \r\nBlack Sabbath \r\nSunny Day Real Estate (first indie/emo band) \r\nElvis Presley \r\nMany jazz artists that I fail to know the name of. \r\nLeonard Cohen (with folk)  \r\nBob Dylan  \r\nthere\'s so many you can\'t even name them all. \r\npretty much every band from before the nineties that made it big impacted music in some way. \r\nBlack Sabbath \r\nJoy Division \r\nBauhaus (original goth) \r\nCurrent 93  \r\nPink Floyd \r\n1) Nightmare Before Christmas, Labyrinth, or The Goonies can\'t decide. \r\n2) No if it\'s religion. \r\n3) I don\'t care.          \nKurt Cobain. . .  \r\n \r\n1. Finding Nemo \r\n2. No \r\n3. Neither          \nChristofer Johnsson of Therion. He practically invented Symphonic Metal. \r\n \r\nYou did say MODERN Rock right. Either everyone else is missing the point or I did.  \r\n \r\nBA2: Star Wars, It\'s #4 now \r\nBA2: Sure do \r\nBA2: Cheap Trick          \nTony Iommi - he created Heavy Metal and Hard Rock.          \nkurt cobain and freddy mercury... \r\n \r\nidk lol \r\nnot much....but a little \r\nidk lol          \nLes Paul. \r\n \r\nWHY:  He invented the solid-body electric guitar and multi-track recording.  There wouldn\'t be any modern rock without either. \r\n \r\nBA:  The Ten Commandments. \r\nBA2:  Absolutely. \r\nBA3:  Eek...well, of those two, "I Want You to Want Me."          \nFreddie Mercury. \r\n \r\nI think he took the whole stage persona to a whole new level.  He made it totally ok to wear singlets on stage, and kind of set the tone for how a front man should command the stage.  I think a lot of modern lead singers take notes from any Freddie Mercury performance. \r\n \r\nBA: The Sandlot \r\nBA2: Not all of them, but there are exceptions. \r\nBA3: Baby I Love Your Way \r\n \r\nHow are you Nancy?

Yes, they reflected the beliefs and ideas of their listeners. As for the government, depends on whether you mean the secular government or the religious authority. Their influence was positive. \r\n \r\nThe first and second Franco-Flemish schools are the foundations for all modern harmony and composers such as Dunstaple, Dufay, Binchois and their successors, Obrecht, Ockeghem and Palestrina, were in large part responsible for the spread of the ideas of the Renaissance.

	{'answer': u'\nThe most popular musicians are mainstream pop, so I would say pop performers like Madonna.  \r\n \r\nDio is arguably the greatest vocalist ever! Of course, I will dedicate a song to him! \r\n \r\nRIP          \nWell I think the death of either the rest of the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, or Pink Floyd would devistate the worlds rock & roll fans. But now a days if Miley Cyrus died everyone would be sad. Personally, if she died, I would throw the biggest party in joy of her death. But again the death of the rest of Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, or Slash would would impact civilized society. \r\n \r\noh almost forgot, dude that\'s not even a question. Of course I would dedicate a song it Dio, he\'s a great musician and deserves a song to be dedicated to. Like this one,. I know it\'s not by Dio, but it seems fit when I heard about his death. \r\n \r\n          \nno metal musician will ever get a "mj" reaction if thats what you mean, look at chuck schuldinger or cliff burton, dio is in the same category as them.  it would take a mainstream pop/rap/classic rock legend to shake the world, like mj.          \nI can\'t name one. But I have been playing his tunes in his honor. The man is a legend and will always be remembered as so, regardless of what Ryan Seacrest says. A metal god fell today. \r\n \r\nYeah, he said it, Last In Line.          \nDIO, why him? He was such a fcking legend.!!! \r\n \r\nI hope no other legends die. I mean it seems like pop and no talent people are making it huge in this world and when somebody who actually was extraordinary dies nobody notices.  \r\n \r\nI would dedicate a song to Dio, but no songs are worthy of him. He deserves a masterpiece.  \r\n \r\nI SHALL DEDICATE THE ENTIRE MUSIC INDUSTRY TO HIM AND EVERY SONG EVER CREATED AS WELL.          \nDio took the metal scene by storm, but the death of Ozzy would be even greater since he\'s a household name among musicians.          \nDavid Bowie\'s death \r\n \r\nOh wait , he can\'t possible die now can he ? I mean he hasn\'t aged since 1977 , he\'s Ziggy Fcking Stardust , for crying out loud  \r\n \r\nOh well if the media and all say that he\'s dead , I\'ll know for sure that he\'s actually in Cuba along with Cobain , Elvis and Ceausescu. \r\nThat\'s where they all go \r\nMA : The Beatles - Getting Better  \r\nOnly because I\'ve been in a Beatles mood lately and I\'m listening to Sgt Pepper right now \r\n \r\nand Dead Souls by Joy Division \r\n          \nI know, it wasn\'t even on Entertainment Tonight last night. \r\n \r\nDio is the metal world\'s Elvis and Lennon. I don\'t want it to impact pop culture. I don\'t want to share my grief. Same goes for any other Metal Legend.  \r\n \r\n \r\nMQ: King of Rock n Roll \r\n          \nRIP Ronnie James Dio, You\'ll be missed. \r\n \r\nI would say any of these would hit like a thunderbolt \r\n \r\nJimmy Page \r\nDavid Bowie \r\nMadonna \r\n \r\nRainbow In The Dark, cause He was, to many of us          \nI did hear my local news today say Ronnie James Dio died ,and they did a story on him. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nmaybe some of these guys \r\n \r\nMick Jagger \r\nKeith Richards \r\nBob Dylan \r\nPaul McCartney \r\nRingo Star \r\nDavid Bowie \r\nEric Clapton \r\nRobert Plant \r\nRod Stewart \r\nRoger Daltrey \r\nElton John \r\nBruce Springsteen \r\nBilly Joel          \nJustin Bieber...half the people will cry for joy...the other half will cry for him....and this affects me because if I want to buy a kit-kat or another candy bar the store is closed because they are crying,          ',

	{'answer': u"\n30 - 60 watts should be sufficient.          \nThis can be easily determined:  Go to a music store with at least your drummer.  Bring a long cable with you or perhaps the store may have one you can use.  Start with the solid state amps in your price range.  Try to set it the way you like and see how far you can get away from it and still hear it with all of the other sounds in the store, including your drummer. \n \nNow do the same with a tube amp that you can afford.  DO NOT make the mistake of assuming a 50 watt solid state combo is going to be louder that a 25 watt tube combo.  Valve amps send more current to speakers.  They are more efficient.  For example; put and Orange Tiny Terror 15 watt into a 4 x 12 cab.  You would shocked at how well that sounds.          \nIf you're going to play with a drummer, you'll need an amp that's powerful enough to gig with in small clubs.  Even if you have no plans to actually play gigs, you'll need one that's big enough because drummers generally play at gig volume, even at practice.  A good drummer can control their volume, but generally you don't find that type of restraint in inexperienced drummers. \n \nYou can get away with lower wattage ratings if you use a tube amp, but they tend to be expensive. I'm currently gigging with a 22 watt Fender Deluxe Reverb (tube amp) and I generally don't have the volume pushed past 3 or 4.    \n \nSolid state amps are less expensive, but you need a higher watt rating to get enough clean volume. I'd recommend something over 50 watts. My other gigging amp is a Roland Cube 80XL (80 watt) and I highly recommend that. Also consider the Vox VT series.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I play guitar, with drums and bass, but my amp is crap. I think my desk lamp uses more watts. I don't really play to big groups though so it doesn't need to be that loud.

	{'answer': u'\nThe Nuremberg Laws of 1935 deemed them an inferior race like Gypises and Jews, but like Gypsies they were never mass exterminated in the way that the Jews were. They were not legally allowed to have relationships with Aryans and were socially isolated, suffering repressions, racist propaganda, and forced sterilization, and non-German black people were sometimes interned in concentration camps alongside Jews or were simply executed.          \nNazis thought of Black people as smart Apes, most people did at the time. \nThe Black cinema worker was in France and probably a descendant of a recent slave. \nNot many Black people immigrated "willingly" to Europe if any at all, so it only makes sense he was born there. \n Inglorious Bastards is pure fiction, a snuff fill that really wanted you to hate "White people" but under the disguise of a particular group of White people.          \nHitler and the Nazis hates anybody NOT like they were. Actually very similar to the conservatives in America today. The US conservatives are not calling for labor camps, but it is their limited life experiences--they do not travel----their isolation---they live and work in one area----and their lack of an education. There were less than 1% of people in Germany that were black. Today there are a lot more, I was there last May, and the German people, some, a small minority, do not like black people and consider them inferior.          \nHad they the time and if everyone else was not being so resistant they probably would have gotten to everyone sooner or later. It was just that all those darn people out there were giving him a hard time and were just not being cooperative at all.          \nnothing important          \nNo, Hitler also exterminated Black People;there just were not very many so you do not hear much about it. There were several thousand half-Blacks in France which Germany conquered, and who were transported to Malthausen, a sub-camp of Dachau made especially for destroying Black people. Interestingly enough, it was a Black American unit who wound up liberating the few survivors of Malthausen, so Black men from America got to see first-hand what Hitler did to the Black people in the Third Reich.          \n"a sub-camp of Dachau made especially for destroying Black people" \n \n Absolute rubbish "elizabeth" \n The prime requirement was that they "undesirable" not that they were black \n \n" it was a Black American unit who wound up liberating the few survivors of Malthausen" \nOh no it wasnt \n   the 1st people into the camp were a squad of 23 US soldiers led by Albert J. Kosiek , and he was not a black american (though its possible there were black americans in the squad (but unlikely cos the US did not tend to have multi-cultural divisions))          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Nazis hated Jews-we all know that. And i'm pretty sure that Hitler didn't like black people (or any one else) either. However, i have seen countless films on the holocaust and the deaths camps  & ghettos but I don't think I ever seen a black man being portrayed in a film about the it. So what were done to people of a different colour to the nazis? There must of been some black/brown people in German occupied Europe. In Inglorious Basterds the black cinema worker was simply asked not to attend, but I don't know how accurate that was. Sorry I don't know much, but i'm quite interested.  ",

	{'answer': u"\nI think Janis Joplin gets ignored in this sense a lot of times, but she is by far teh most soulful voice i have ever heard          \nFor me (IMO) probably Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Layne Staley, and Kurt Cobain. (Jimi and Janis died in the same year :(  )          \nI miss Joe Strummer.          \nRandy Rhodes          \nFreddie Mercury          \nrandy rhodes from ozzy osbourne went to early for me. \r\n \r\nliving musician~toni iommi from black sabbath because he started the whole heavy metal guitar sound.          \nr.i.p dimebag......          \nJeff Buckley \r\n \r\n \r\nI have no idea how to answer your second question          \nLayne Staley. well MJ already died so probably Eric Clapton, One of the stones or the two remaing beatles          \ni miss jimi hendrix the most \r\nbut he was so prolific i think he would have made nearly 50 albums by now if he were still alive \r\n \r\nand i think the world will sorrowfully miss slash \r\nhe does much more in the music industry then people realize          \nMe personally, Vitek Kieltyka. \r\nDam, he was amazing. \r\n \r\nI'd say Dimebag will get the majority of the answers, though. \r\n \r\nMikael Akerfeldt. I don't like Opeth, but his musicianship is amazing and his death will rock the metal world.          \nKurt Cobain, way too young and a lot of talent  \r\n \r\nCurrent living musician's death.. umm... maybe Bob Dylan, Bono or Madonna  \r\nbut i don't see how anyones death could have that much impact on the music world... what they produced during their life time would have more of an impact          \njim morrison, kurt cobain, and jimi hendrix. and john lennon too          \nI'd agree with the Janis joplin post and disagree with the Maynard post..... Hes not dead...... \r\nfor me though itd have to be Skynyrd or Bradley Knowle of Sublime          \nmichael jackson has the biggest impact.          \nJust ME.          \nJim Morrison \r\nJanis Joplin \r\nRandy Rhoads \r\nFreddie Mercury \r\nJimi Hendrix \r\nBob Marley \r\nJoe Strummer \r\nJohnny Thunders \r\nJohn Lennon \r\n \r\nAnd..Eric Clapton? \r\nor any of the surviving Beatles          \ngod damn, just imagine what else jimi hendrix could have taught us from his magical space cloud!          \nFreddie Mercury easily          \nJimi Hendrix or Freddie Mercury are my too favourties. They released so much great stuff, but they could of released so much more. \r\nJeff Buckley also, a sad loss. \r\n \r\nAs for current musician to die that is still recording. I would say Bono, but U2 seem to have lost their way in the last couple of album. \r\nBut music is so bad nowadays that i will have to say Bono.          \nI think Jimi mightve affected to world most if he continued, him or Kurt Cobain, and I'm thinking that maybe bob dylans death?          \nBon Scott \r\nStevie Ray Vaughan \r\nDuane Allman \r\n \r\nThe one that would affect me the most would be David Gilmour          \nHendrix and Elvis****************          \nFor me it's John Bonham. I'd give almost anything to hear what directions Zep would have went in in the 1980's          \nLennon \r\nand chuck berry          \nI'd say Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Buckley, Janis Joplin, Nick Drake, Bob Marley, Kurt Cobain. oh and I miss Syd Barret!!!  \r\n \r\nI'd miss David Bowie, Bob Dylan, ah and definitely Jimi Page and Robert Plant!!!          \nStevie Ray Vaughn  \r\nBuddy Holly          \nJimi Hendrix \r\nJim Morrison & \r\nJanis Joplin \r\n \r\nPaul McCartney's will have          \nJanis Joplin, She was the sign of her times and she had the best voice for rock and roll/blues of any female to date!  \r\n \r\nHarry Chapin and Jim Croce were gone before their time and both were very good folk/story telling singers.

Grammar errors again. You don't need to use a common before 'and'.You use 'comprehend' twice I'd change one of them to avoid repetition there. I prefer this one to the first one it gripped me more but a lot of grammatical errors.  \n \nI only read the beginning of each story, I think of the three I prefer 'broken wing' because it seems quite possible it could happen. I think you do have a talent and you did draw me into your story. If your examiner requires similes and metaphors you may want to add them and just look at your grammar, some of your sentences are long (as mentioned.) In the first two stories it seemed an issue but not in the third. I'd look at how dialogue is presented in published stories to make sure you are doing it right.  \n \nOtherwise there is nothing wrong with what you are writing from what I read. After all your young and you have some talent there .

	 'question': u'\n    I need someone to tell me why the Inspector could be portrayed as a ghost and for someone to pier mark what I have so far. p.s the essay is about the role of the inspector  \n         Set in 1912, J.B. Priestley\'s An Inspector Calls is a play based upon an Edwardian family who are rudely interrupted by an inspector who inquires about the death of a girl called Eva Smith. But little do we know about who the inspector really is, and the somewhat coincidental connections the girl had with the Birling\'s. \n         The inspector, or Inspector Goole, can be explained in many different ways. It is thought that he could be a ghost, an angel sent by god to deliver the truth, a psychic able to see the future, or just a socialist crank, which is in fact what Mr Birling states towards the end of the play "That fellow obviously didn\'t like us, he was prejudiced against us from the start. Probably a socialist of some sort of crank, he talked like one".  ',

If you go for a bright blue make sure it isn't the same tone (brightness or darkness) as the dress or it could cause some serious eye confusion! :-)          \nI would say a white or black blazer however white is quite impractical for a wedding no matter how good it looks, maybe a cardigan is a safer and slightly more comfortable option (it is also easier to wash). As for shoes heeled sandals in tan, black or white would look good for the ceremony and something a bit more comfortable for the after party, simple ballet pumps or flats. Hope this helps and enjoy the wedding :)          ",

You are 28, you have been there, done that and you know what heartache and sacrifice are. She doesn't. \r\nRight now she's so focused on being hot and meeting guys her age that she isn't thinking about dating a guy 10 years older than her whom she knows her parents will disapprove of. Cut her some slack.  \r\nAt least she has enough respect for herself to not dive into a relationship with you and she's actually pondering what could happen if she did. \r\nIf I were her I would be so concerned about what my parents thought, so maybe she is too.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I\'m 28 yrs old, and I met an 18 yr old chick with whom I really click with and started falling for! Before I go on I must first say, that she and I met through a mutual gig in where we both had to sing (we\'re both musicians). From there we started texting each other a lot- like everyday! That lasted about 2-3 weeks. And in the course of that 2-3 weeks I presented to her other gigs in the hopes that I\'d have the opportunity to practice with her, hang out with her, see her and hear her again. We did those gigs and we did enjoy each other\'s company, flirting here in there. One day we got into a conversation about our love lives, and she mentioned that when she was in high school, she had an "ideal spouse paper" that she wrote, and that the qualities that she was looking for in a man remain the same many qualities she listed. She actually let me read the paper, and I kid you not that paper described me- with the exception of the age gap, in which she said the biggest age gap she\'d go for was 6 years! That same day, after reading that paper and having that conversation I invited her out for yogurt, and with her being the type (as she says) to "not beat around the bush" she calls me out and says that she knows I have feelings for her! I admit it and ask her the same and she also agrees but with doubt due to our age gap. She says she feels weird about the age gap because I\'m older than her oldest cousin who is 26 yrs old. (I must say I am 28 but I\'m ALWAYS mistaken to be 18-21 =p)  Ever since then we\'ve been talking on the phone endlessly almost every night. She started this thing where she asks me how much I like her on a scale of 1-10 and we tell each other our numbers. One day in June, she out of nowhere says the number doesn\'t exist for her because she doesn\'t like me in that way anymore. This is where I got thrown off and am still thrown off. At first I was kind of upset and said that maybe I should just back off, but she was like sad in the sense that she said she would miss talking to me and being my friend. In my part, I said to myself, if I really did genuinely like this girl, it would be hypocritical of me to just stop talking to her and just give up. So we continued on- and it feels like nothing has changed. This is what is confusing me! One day a few weeks back she called me and said she had the urge to call me several times throughout the day and had nothing to say but just wanted to call. (Which I thought was sweet.) She and her cousin came out to my gig to support me. We still talk on the phone endlessly every other night. She gives me really long hugs when we say goodbye (but says I suck at hugging?) The other day she asked me if I had one thing to tell her before she died what would it be? I took a really long time to tell her cuz and started beating around the bush and joked around and suggested that instead of telling her, that I kissed her instead. She was like that could be- but what would you SAY? So I told her I would say "I love you". And from there I explained to her that I had fallen for her in that sense. Since this was all on the phone in the wee late hrs of night, she said she was hiding her face in a pillow since she was so flattered.... \r\n \r\nSo I know as a dude- I\'m completely oblivious to girls\' reactions. I feel like this girl has feelings for me but I know she says otherwise. Could it be she\'s in denial? Am I looking too deep into it? I really am in love with this girl for many reasons- alot of which I can\'t explain but makes sense. Female opinions please! =) sorry so longg....  ',

	{'answer': u'\nI\'m a fan of Visual Kei music, especially Moi dix Mois and Malice Mizer. \r\n \r\nMoi dix Mois uses many different kinds of make up and one of their members (male) dresses in lolita as a sort of gimmick, but he\'s straight as can be, has never said to be married, or anything like that. Being as how this is Japanese, weeaboos take a good thing and ruin it for everyone.  \r\n \r\n"omg Mana-sama is so kawaii you know he\'s still totally making hawt yaoi with Gackt" \r\n \r\nThat hurt.  \r\n \r\nThat hurt to write.  \r\n \r\nAnother that I like is an artist like Heather Dale. Her song "Mordred\'s Lullaby" is one of my favorites...its about Morgan Lefay, who was supposedly a witch.  \r\n \r\nThe comments go something like this:  \r\n"Morgan was a witch which means she\'s evil so she had to be a devil worshipper" \r\nDo I need to go there?          \nsame here  \r\n \r\nBQ: rough and ready by saxon \r\nBQ2: trolls \r\nBQ3: it\'s cool \r\nBQ4: satan\'s fall by mercyful fate          \nI like metalcore,hardcore,etc.... But I hate all the fan girls and sometimes boys  \r\nAnd i also like classic rock and I hate the same thing you put or "am I the only 14 year old boy/girl that likes pink Floyd" and shyt like that \r\n \r\nBa- any given Sunday by upon a burning body \r\nBa2-hmm? Probably i dont know I have to think \r\nBa3- I agree with you \r\nBa4- I dont know \r\nI hate Hartley by the amity affliction          \n(prog rock) - sometimes can\'t enjoy less serious types of music \r\n(indie rock) - "hipsters", lol \r\n(old music) - say everything new or mainstream sucks \r\n \r\nbq:Nick Drake - Pink Moon \r\nbq2:trolls, obviously \r\nbq3:I agree, though the rank wasn\'t that interesting          \nRadiohead fans are too serious. Beatles fans don\'t realise what a douche John was. Shoegaze fans are too depressing.  \r\n \r\nba: nothing.  \r\nba2: too many questions about mainstream music, which I generally despise.  \r\nba3: I\'ve seen more ranty rants in my time.  \r\nba4: something that is hated? you mean like something evil, or a sickness? School\'s Out by Alice Cooper. Every hates school.          \ni\'ve never really thought about it, but now that you\'ve brought it up, you got me thinking... \r\n \r\nBA: \'\'in the end\'\' - linkin\' park \r\nBA2: the user \'\'duck\'\' \r\nBA3: its cool bro \r\nBA4: idk          \nI like metal, rock, etc, and I hate the elitists (the people who think I\'m a dumb f*** for liking slipknot), I hate the music supremacists (the people who bad mouth every other genre without listening to it , especially rap) I hate the kids who only listen to "core" stuff and make no attempt to appreciate metal properly, especially the one\'s who then turn around and say "why do you hate new metal and only like old bands blah blah blah" when it has ZERO \r\n relevance to me how new the freakin band is that I\'m hating on, I hate the old school fans who constantly complain that there\'s "no good metal anymore and it\'s dying etc" and that\'s about it, those are all the people I hate. \r\n \r\nBQ: I was just listening to "Fear and the nervous system" which is Munky(from KoRn)\'s new band, it\'s actually really good, it\'s like a cross between Tool and Korn, it\'s a nice blend of modern/90\'s sound. \r\n \r\nBQ2: every time I post a question recommending a band I just found, no one answers the damn question. \r\n \r\nBQ3: I\'d be p1ssed off too, but not because he mentioned his age, because he quoted the dumbest and least true phrase ever uttered, "today\'s music sucks". We have the internet for a reason bro, to find new and interesting bands, why not make use of it instead of complaining that music sucks when it doesn\'t. \r\n \r\nBQ4: "The politics of ecstasy" by Nevermore, it\'s about hating "the pigs that turn the screws" ie \'Politicians\'          \nI listen to pop punk music, and something that annoys me is that there is a large selection of fans who are "straight edge", and they think that makes them superior to people who don\'t choose the same lifestyle.  Personally, I don\'t smoke, do drugs, and I VERY RARELY drink, but I would never force my opinion on someone else and I have plenty of friends who do various combinations of all those things.  So many straight edge kids won\'t even associate with people who aren\'t just like them.   \r\n \r\nbq: My Friends Over You by New Found Glory \r\nbq2: I don\'t like that rock and pop are thrown in the same category.  There should be more sub-sections for different types of rock music. \r\nbq3: I completely agree!  \r\nbq4: I Won\'t Say The Lord\'s Prayer by The Wonder Years (hating on organized religion...)          \nToday\'s music is amazing, it\'s just harder to find. \r\n \r\nI have no pet peeves about the fans, because I listen to the music, not the words of the people who also listen to it. \r\n \r\nBQ: "Lucid Moments" - Tune \r\nBQ2: The trolls, most of the time, are mediocre and unentertaining. \r\nBQ3: I used to be like that. Not sure why you\'d hate on someone else\'s opinion, they\'re probably just trying to be Internetually accepted.. for some reason.  \r\nBQ4: "Wish You Were Here" (hatin\' on drug addiction)          \nHi Kim  \n \nI love Classical music but the people are annoying as hell the one thing I hate most is when they call everything that\'s not as complex or sophisticated as Classical "Pop" it really pisses me off \n \nAlso I hate it when they refuse to admit that Classical can be used in other genres >:( \n \nAnd I also hate it when Rock fans pick on modern artists without even listening to them because they\'re not from the 70s  \n \nBQ:Nothing \nBQ2:Its a toss up between the close minded elitists and the angry Atheists  \nBQ3:It was hawt :P \nBQ4:The Needle and the Damage Done-Niel Young          \nIf there is anything that bothers me about fans like that, is they claim to know everything about the band, but only know the songs that come on greatest hit records. But don\'t truely know the bands music at all.  As on this site, what does one heard the most when someone talks about a certain band or artist, we only hear of things like "Exile On Main Street", or a few other albums by said artist, when they also have great abums like, "Out Of Our Heads" "December\'s Children", "Flowers", which all have some great tunes, just as good as or even better in some cases that albums like "Exile On Main Street\'. You can use my example with any artist you want to choose, and most times end up with the same result. I don\'t mind that these fans like that certain album or song, but its when they carry on and say things, like this is the only good music that band has ever made. Which shows me, they don\'t know the band\'s music at all.  \r\n \r\nbq: Rough Trade - High School Confidential    \r\n \r\nbq2: Things like we should seperate pop from rock. I find people with this mind set, have no love for the sake of music, but there own taste, and that is all that matters to them, and if they want to think along them lines, why not just stay away from this site, if your not happy with the way it is run. For me, I love the way it is all keep together, as one gets to know more about what others like or don\'t like, and one gets a better feeling or knowing what the other person is all about when it comes to music, I myself love learning what people have interest in when it comes to different styles of music, whether it be metal, rock, blues, jazz, country, folk, rap, R&B, and so on and so on.  I wish others could love music for the sake of music and not just for the genre of music, which is so often shown here, but that I am saying, when people have to put others down for what they like or don\'t like. I say just sit back and enjoy what you love, without showing any hate towards someone else for their taste in music. \r\n \r\nbq3: What you stated, you said well. \r\n \r\nbq4: Sorry can\'t think of one at this time. \r\n \r\n \r\ntake care \r\ndave          \nI agree with Luke G\'s comment about metal fans. You can run into some real snobs and elitists which annoy the hell out of you. \r\n \r\nI also love classic rock, blues and jazz so by some metal-heads standards I\'m just a poseur.          \nmetal: "nu metal, metalcore, and deathcore are NOT metal! blah blah blah blah."  \r\ndon\'t get me wrong, i\'m not a fan of any of those genres, but shut the f*ck up! \r\n \r\npunk: "blah blah blah, you\'re a poser because your clothes are too clean. You\'re poser because you don\'t live on the streets and you didn\'t grow up in a really poor household and you don\'t eat out of a trash can. Is that an Adolescents patch? That sh*t\'s not punk, it\'s too mainstream. Can you spare some change? no? you\'re a f*cking poser, if you were a real punk you would spare me some change. blah blah blah."  \r\n \r\nbq: Saint Vitus - I bleed black \r\n \r\nbq2: i feel like i\'m wasting so much time when i log on here. \r\nbq3: i agree with what you\'re saying. \r\nbq4: Victims of Internal Decay - False Hate  \r\n          ',

	{'answer': u'\nPorn has a way to teist our minds. When you first start watching porn you look at the simple stuff then your mind starts to wounder. I once had the urge to watch fisting. I though it was the most sickest thing ever but i kept watching it. I never seen gay porn thought becasue I tried to not to watch anything with 2 guys in it. Pretty soon i realized enough was enough. Porn was talking over because i was starting to watc even more bizarre things that i dont even want to talk about. I dont know how porn does it but it does. It best for you to try to not watch porn and try not to masturbate so much. Soon you urges will start to fade. But not gonna lie it gonna take some time.          \nFirst off, you need to chill out. Most teenage boys masturbate 1-5 times a day so you&#x27;re perfectly normal (not a porn addict). As long as you&#x27;re looking at girls over 14,  I doubt anyone would say you&#x27;re a pedophile.  \n \nAbout the gay thing, you&#x27;re panicking over something stupid. The fact you had a forced experience when you were younger May have triggered something slightly arousing about it but you&#x27;re not gonna fall in love with a gay person or whatever. Just be you. Do what you want. And I doubt you&#x27;ll end up gay, but if you do, so what? Who cares. Good for you.  \n \nBut because you really like this one girl, you&#x27;re obviously straight. Most girls look at lesbian stuff so, it&#x27;s not all that different. I bet loads of boys are going through what you are, they just don&#x27;t say anything.  \n \nDon&#x27;t panic. You&#x27;ll be fine. You&#x27;re not mental, you&#x27;re a teenage boy.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I'm 13, male, and recently I've been getting urges to masturbate to gay stuff. Sometimes it's the occasional nagging thought while I'm getting off to girls, sometimes it's a full on urge to look at at stuff. The thing is, I'm pretty sure I'm straight. You may say that can't be true, but deep down I believe I am.  \nThis is the cycle I'm talking about, it started about a month ago. (I masturbate once or twice a day to girls/porn, I'm attracted to girls not guys - get an urge to look at gay stuff, or a thought - I always ejaculate to girls - I worry about it - I masturbate once or twice a day to girls... etc.) So what part of the cycle can I remove to stop me worrying? \nI think I'm straight cos I've masturbated to girls for quite a while now, and I'm attracted to them. I feel no arousal looking at a guy, but girls turn me on. I've had 2 girlfriends and hundreds of crushes: there's someone I really like at the moment. Yet these urges persist. \nI had a forced same sex experience when I was younger, no real stuff, just fooling around, but it worries me. When I was younger I read a little gay erotica and had some gay fantasies, but much more straight stuff. I've had some dreams too, that caused me a lot of worry, and some aroused me! But I don't feel any attraction to guys, and it's only these masturbation urges. So what's going on? Is it HOCD, cos I've felt similar fears: fear I was a porn addict, a pedophile, I was terminally ill, gay... I also have a guilt complex, if that helps.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nThat\'s amazing mine has the exact same power!          \nTo be the best mom.          \nWell isn\'t that special... \r\nMine has the ability to rupture eardrums with her incessant screaming/yelling/hysterics...          \nlol actually my dad makes me feel the way ur mom makes u feel , my mom\'s super power is to try to help me in anyway possible. \r\n \r\np.s i hate my dad lol          \nMine has eyes in the back of her head! \r\nI\'ve never seen them though! \r\nShe\'s sneaky! \r\n \r\n:D \r\nNot much of a power but more of an abnormality haha!!          \nMine has the abilty to call me whenever i am doing something important.  \r\n \r\nAnd even if she calls and says, "what are you doing", and then I reply, "Eating dinner", or something important, she continues to talk......!          \nThat\'s funny, because mine can make me feel great from 1600 miles away, with a simple 1 minute phone conversation.          \nshe gave birth to the coolest kid ever ...... my brother .... \r\nand the lamest kid ever .... my other brother \r\nand the most average kid ever .... me          \nMy mother has the ability to make ANY situation seem better from 1150 miles away, its an amazing gift she has. Her words of comfort and advice are like gold.          \nWhen we are talking to her, she never hears, even if we are in the same room and screaming.  When we are in the basement whispering about her, we hear her screaming about how we always talk about her.          \nwow i didn\'t notice it until now \r\nbut just by looking at the word \r\nmother i felt my heart break  \r\n.......... now i call that powers ~          \nmy mother has the 6th scence that something is wrong. like being sick or injured in a some type of accident b4 you even begin to tell here.          \nWell, she always had the eyes in the back of her head thing. Plus, she is (I think) the best mom in the world! \r\n \r\nAnd I wanted to tell Beechy that she doesn\'t smell the cig on your breath! She smells it ALL OVER you. Anyone can do that. They stink and they make you stink!          \nshe holds some kind of obedience medallion, \r\ni cant help but follow her command , this and that . \r\nsomehow shes a juggernaut in disguise too who has the power to  throw me out of the house if i didnt follow her every command, luckily i havent seen that evil side of her.          \nI think my mom is pretty remarkable. She\'s almost 56 years old and she has recently graduated from nursing school. She has never been married and she raised me on her own, and I\'m sure that wasn\'t easy. She has always worked her a*s off to provide for both of us. Now, not only does she have her own problems to deal with, but she is also helping take care of her disabled sister. I know it probably doesn\'t sound like much, but I\'m pretty impressed.          \nMy mother is capable of similar feats. She has many abilities. Though she has mastered excessive shouting & lack of understanding.          \nShe appears unexpectedly out of nowhere and i might guess she has a super hearing and she has supersonic screams... the mom from hell...          \nsuper-hearing, the ability to throw a shoe with super-human accuracy. super-strength,  stretching powers.          \nTo stand by her children, when we need her most, but at the same time point it out to us if we are in the wrong.She also has the power to make me feel like I use to when I was a kid, even though I\'am a mom  now, which is safe and loved no matter what.          \nWow your mom and mine have the same power but mine is 1500 miles away and can always make me feel worse when I\'m having a bad day.          \nShe knows everything I am going to do wrong before I even do it and likes to comment on it and She always makes me feel like crap during a visit or a phone conversation. Unfortunately she only lives 6 miles away.          \nmine must have x-ray vision or something.  its like whenever i wanna feel sorry for myself and be alone in my room, she\'s like "you need to get out here and quit feeling sorry for yourself".  its SO annoying!          \nAll of em.  \r\n \r\nShe once carried this girl in here stomach for 9 months, threw up ALOT, had major back pains, couldn\'t sleep at night, worked, and took care of 3 other children all at the same time and than she shoved me through a 9 cm hole after 48 hours of excurtiating pain all without taking one un natural pain eliminater. Oh yeah she did once more after that. That was just one of her super powers she had.  \r\n \r\nPlenty more though!          \nMines too , she gets me mas all the time sometimes i just wished i do bad things to her , but i just cant!!!!!!!!! I\'M EVIL :((((((          \n*Nagginalldatime* and mine has the ability to make me feel guilty bout crap I didn\'t even do, go figure!!          \nMy MIL has that power \r\n \r\nMy mom is cool, she is a mind reader, understands almost everyone (no matter what race they are or what language they speak, Russian, Spanish, Korean, even though she speaks none of these languages) and has eyes in the back of her head. I swear she can also tell when I\'m lying, but never says anything, even though I know she knows that I know lol. She\'s kind of like the mom off of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" only she is Irish and Cherokee.          \nmine can cry uncontrollabley like on demand.... \r\n \r\nbut there is always a super vilian that has counter powers \r\n \r\nunfortunately for my mom and her crying emo powers, its me, her own son, who is her nemesis, with my awesome power of not really giving a fvck!..lol.. it comes in handy alot...  \r\n \r\nshe crys, i laugh, who gives a fvck..lol!          \nHer paralyzing guilt-ray, \r\nand her selective-memory that has the ability to re-write history.          \nsuper powers really! i dont think nobody got super powers          ',

	{'answer': u'\ni know its not suicide he said in an interview "I want to live forever" \r\ni believe the doctor killed him or that it was accidental \r\nbut everything is pointing to the doctor it seems          \nIt doesn\'t much matter to me.  He\'s passed on \r\n \r\nMay he rest in peace.          \nWell I kind of think all the meds killed him but he also did have lupus. I would really like to say the illness killed him just because i dont want to think one of my role models died of and od but I am leaning more towards the meds.          \nHe\'s dead and your wall of text is too big.          \ni thought he had a heart attack \r\ni think it was from the prescription drugs so sorta his doctors fault          \nTo be honest, \r\nhe\'s dead  \r\nand gone  \r\nso it really shouldn\'t be that big of a deal \r\ni mean i realize that he was the king of pop  \r\ni believe that the doctor didn\'t do anything   \r\nor anything etc..  \r\ni think he just died naturally          \ni dont beleive that he committed suicide. also IF that were the case he would have updated his will, but i dont think that he would intentionaly leaves his children. i dont think it was a natrual death either. i think that it was the diprivan. i think that the doctor was there to monitor him when he got put under. he was not able to wake Mike and started cpr on a bed that was already firm incase this would happen, or has happened before. at first i thought that the there must be only one reason why the doctor took so long to call 911 \r\n \r\n1. he was trying to revive him with cpr, to avoid a big news story, and maybe that had happened before and the doc thought he could bring him back \r\n \r\n2. he took so long to call 911 because he had to clear out all the machines...iv pole and oxygen tank, so as to not get caught. because he knew full well that it was illeagal.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I know this may have been asked before, but this question is to hear you answers, and also let my opinions out in the open. \r\nI have several possibilities, and I will first list them, and then explain them all. \r\nThe possibilities are suicide, murder, natural death, or disease. Drug abuse is listed as suicide. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI figure it could be suicide for one main reason: Micheal Jackson's past. If anyone has ever known anything about M.J., they'd know that his life has been filled with pain and abuse, especially in his childhood. He also had to deal with the hardships of burns, skin diseases, as well as false accusations of child molestation. He was guilty of being a bad father, but this was because he was mentally un-stable. You have to at least give him credit for trying to get help for it. \r\n \r\nI know that the second autopsy was said to rule out foul play, but I'd still like to record my thoughts previous to getting the results. Although it is a low percentage, it still might be a possibility. The dosage of his pills could have been raised, or his pills might have even been replaced by something else. For all we know, he might have been slowly being murdered for a month or so now. The autopsy showed that there were slightly dissolved pills in the stomach, but tests have not yet been ran to determine what the pill was, or what concentration it was. Also, the autopsy reported that he might have fell recently... pushed down in rage, perhaps? \r\n \r\nNatural death... well... it still wouldn't have been natural. Any you way you think of it, dying before you are eighty means that something sped it up. Whether it is smoking or pills... dying young is not natural. But it is possible he died 'naturally', even though it was sped up from stress and other various things. I hope this is the conclusion... any other thing is preventable in some ways, so any other conclusion won't please his fans in the least... \r\n \r\nDisease. How many problems did M.J. have again? I can't quite remember, but there is one that sticks in my head completely:  \r\nSkin cancer. \r\nYes, he did have treatment, and had the cells shaved off of his chest, but treatment doesn't always work. How I see it, this is the most logical explanation. He was only having about one meal per day according to the autopsy and witnesses, so I don't think that meant he was healthy. If he didn't die from any of the above things, it is logical to presume that the cancer would have came back and killed him in the end. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAlright, so that is my opinion, so I would like to hear yours. No, he was not killed by Kira, and don't think you are clever by saying that to me. I've heard it before. \r\nToo many times.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nthe simple fact that it is a "medical professonal violation" is what makes him guilty. \r\n \r\nhell yeah  the prosecution has a case. i figured they have already won.          \nRegardless, Dr. Murrey still didn\'t handle the care of Michael Jackson in a proper way. From the very beginning he could have said NO, he can\'t give him that drug. He could be the nicest Dr. you\'d ever want to meet but because of negligence, Michael is no longer with us.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I don't think they have anything. They are trying to find a scapegoat for Michael Jackson's death. But Michael Jackson did this to himself. The doctor merely gave Jackson what he wanted. In my opinion, that is not manslaughter. It may have been unethical for a doctor to administer a heavy anesthetic (without the proper breathing device) to his patient so his patient could get some sleep, but that's not manslaughter. It seems to be more of a medical professional violation than anything else. The most fitting punishment I can think of is that they prevent him from practicing medicine for the remainder of his life. And maybe they have already pulled his medical license for life. I'm not sure. So anyways, what's your take on this? Does the prosecution have a case?  ",

	{'answer': u'\nOperator Please is a pop punk band but they have a violinist, which is pretty cool. Also check out Andrew Bird. He\'s a really good songwriter, and he incorporates violin, glockenspiel, and whistling into his music. \r\n \r\nYou might also like Architecture in Helsinki. They don\'t really use the violin as a primary instrument, but they\'ve used basically every instrument you can think of: lots of synths, trumpets, glockenspiels, thumb pianos, the sound of tap shoes and bubbles popping, etc. =]          \nApocalyptica are a metal band that play with violins and cellos. They\'re really cool! \r\n \r\nxx          \ndevil down to georgia  \r\n \r\ngood riddence          \nTry Big n Rich          \nPeter Murphy - Cuts You Up \r\n \r\n \r\none of my favorites for sure =) \r\n          \nCountry - Dixie Chicks. \r\n \r\nMany of their songs have some great violin (or would that be fiddle?) stuff in them.          \nI noted the violin capabilities of The Charlie Daniels Band when they played "The Devil Went Down to Georgia." However, I\'m not really one who goes after the sounds of a violin. The orchestra version of One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy 7 is also a great showing of the abilities of the violin.          \n(good riddance) time of your life -green day \r\n \r\nafterlife -avenged sevenfold \r\n \r\nthere\'s no sympathy for the dead -escape the fate \r\n \r\nthe day i left the womb -escape the fate \r\n \r\nand i suggest you check out the band vampire weekend(: \r\nespecially the song M79. i\'ll put that in the source.          \nTantric, they are awesome and they include violin in a lot of their songs, and it\'s not just as background, they have a the violin play some of the solos,  Cool songs by them are Lay and Down and Out  \r\n  \r\nanother ones are  \r\nI don\'t want to miss a thing by Aerosmith  \r\nAfterlife by Avenged Sevenfold (but the album version is the one with the violins in it, and also Cello)  \r\nAlways by Bon Jovi (a lot of Bon Jovi\'s songs have violin in them but this is the only one i can think of right now)  \r\nNovember Rain by Guns N\' Roses  \r\nWhen you look me in the eyes by The Jonas Brothers (yeah, i\'m getting ready for the TD but the song actually has a very nice violin part)   \r\nWith arms wide open by Creed (there is a version with violins in it) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSome other bands that you might want to chek out are Apocalyptica and Trans-siberian Orchestra (TSO) even if Apocalyptica plays Cello they also play in Trebble Cleff and it sounds like Violin.          \nViolin? Nice choice \r\n \r\nDown and Out- Tantric \r\nDust In the Wind- Kansas \r\nAnts Marching- Dave Matthews \r\nIf- Bread \r\nHurricane- Bob Dylan \r\nHave I Told You Lately- Van Morrison \r\nSpace Oddity- David Bowie \r\nShe\'s A Rainbow- Rolling Stones \r\nTurned To Stone- Electric Light Orchestra          \nnearly all yellowcards songs have violin in and it sounds AWESOME!! try download a song called breathing by them.. brilliant :)          ',

	{'answer': u"\nI would never buy a dreadnought with a cedar top - too warm and missing the highs almost entirely. Admittedly it's a matter of personal taste but you should try them both and buy the one you prefer. I'm not a big fan of dreadnoughts in general so in your case I'd much rather buy a Martin 000-16GT over both of them, ditto for various Eastman models.          \nA lot of folks seem to like Takamine, I recently tried a few of them and honestly I was not impressed. These were the higher end models also. I had a D-16 RGT and still kicking myself for selling it. It was a killer acoustic. I've since tried some much more expensive models that I didn't like as much, but maybe I just had a really good one. But yeah, I'd definitely go with a Martin over any Takamine. If you are willing to spend D28 money that is certainly a great choice, but I was just as happy with my 16. It doesn't use a dovetail joint like the 28, but played and sounded great.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    hi peps  im just looking for some diff opinions to help me decide what guitar to buy . ill be buying it on pay monthly just so you know .  \n \ni haven't played for a few years but ive decide to to start again and im thinking of getting a singer and do a acoustic duo. im also into more technical playing as well, like classical and chet atkins style.  \n \ni have always liked martin guitars if im honest. they are my favorite and i do tend to like american guitars. love the deep warm sound of the martins . but the takamine does look real nice and is better value for money seeing as it has the electronics plus its a lot cheaper. i also think with the martin that if i was going to stretch to that i would be better going for something like the d28 but i cant afford that atm ???

	{'answer': u'\nNot sure \nbut this is old.  \n          \nI apologise, this answer is much longer than I expected it to be: \r\n \r\nAs far as I know, mediaeval babes often sing a lot of traditional mediaeval stuff, mostly from Europe: \r\n \r\n- For secular (well, mostly) traditional music, any good folk musician would usually include mediaeval ballads. Many of these were collected by men like Francis James Child, but others survived by themselves: \r\n - For Scotland (and a few English songs) people such as the Corries (lovely voices) and Ewan McColl did good renditions of ballads such as Jock O\' Braidislee and the Elfin Knight respectively, though their repertoir is not always mediaeval, and may include early modern and some twentieth century folk music. There is also a strong tradition of Gaelic music on the Scottish folk scene, though I\'m not as familiar with it as with the stuff in Scots.  \r\n \r\n- Wales also has some good stuff to offer (though generally in Welsh of course), and Carreg Lafar are quite good- their renditions of "Blewyn Glas" and "Can Merthyr" are rather nice.  \r\n \r\n- English songs, meanwhile, are easily found- they have passed into such common usage that you might already be familiar with songs like "Lavender\'s Blue" and, of course, "Greensleeves" (though we are unsure who it was actually written by) and there are soooo many people who have done recordings of them over the years. For more modern renditions, you might want to have a look at Peter, Paul and Mary\'s version of the "Three Ravens", and, of course, Simon and Garfunkel\'s famous re-working of the popular "Scarborough Fair".  \r\n \r\n- Irish music is pretty damn well covered, so you\'ll have no trouble finding traditional music there- just typing Irish music into Youtube will open you up to a whole genre in the music industry.  \r\n \r\n- For continental music, I\'m nowhere near an expert, but there was an album kicking around on Youtube with some songs in Occitan, called "Music of the Troubadours". \r\n \r\n- On the religious side of things, this will mostly be apparent in the form of Christmas carols, such as the traditional French Noel Nouvelet, and the Coventry Carol (which was written as part of a mystery play). Many good ones coming from the collection of songs known as Piae Cantiones, and several may have been traditional- songs from this collection have been translated from Latin into English and include Good King Wenceslas. So, again, simply search the title in Youtube and you should find a few good church choirs who sing these. \r\n \r\n \r\nI apologise for going on so long, but hopefully you\'ll find what you\'re looking for somewhere in this spiel.  \r\nAs far as I\'m aware, Mediaeval Baebes also sing some stuff which isn\'t what would exactly be termed "traditional" as it was written by a fairly well-known composer, but still dates from the Renaissance and Mediaeval periods: \r\n \r\n- There\'s a large amount of deliberately composed secular music kicking around as well, particularly from the Renaissance decades- John Dowland and Thomas Morley were very good composers, and if you search songs like "Come Again" or "Now is the Month of Maying" you should be able to find some very good versions, which will have links to other songs. I cannot give you any particular musicians, but you should be able to find some common names on there. \r\n \r\n- If you want choral/religious music, then really what you\'re be best doing is looking up a couple of mediaeval and Renaissance composers on Wikipedia and typing their name into Youtube- there are often good recordings on there of church music. Thomas Tallis is a good one to start with (Salvator Mundi, Spem in Alium) or Palestrina (Sicut Cervus is very nice).          ',

	{'answer': u"\nlol. i can do too but my sister can't. she told me its genetic and my mom disagrees. so i guess you're right          \nHey...These are some of the Mendelian characters you are taking about .. \nthey surely are genetical.. \nFor Ex : Tongue rolling ,dimple in cheeks ,cleft chin, red and green colour blindnes etc \nthese characters are controlled in humans by two forms/factors these are dominant or recessive  \nif you are dominant then you have this character ( you are definately dominant here ,,that you can roll your tongue)  ,if recessive you dont ..these recessive people cant do it ever in their life..          \nLol if you are Welsh or French you don't have much choice if you wish to speak correctly, I can roll my tongue and purr like a cat if I want to, provokes a great reaction in real cats.          \nJust tried it and yes I can. Does that count as a skill to add to my CV? I'll just be sending them a piece of paper with my name and address on it otherwise.          \nGenetics or the role of genes are not as straight forward as first though, just because someone has set or group of genes in their DNA that doesn't mean that these genes are active, they could lie dormant for years decades or even for the persons whole life. \n \nWhat triggers em into life to become active is in most instances a mystery, combinations of different genes being effected by different things such temperature (to hot, to cold), food (to much, to little, bad food, good food) chemicals, drugs, age (old, young), the list is endless. \n \nNo matter how hard we try to control and live our lives we live in diverse chaotic environments and not just any one thing but any number of things acting in concert can effect the genes that we have all inherited from our parents, switching some off, switching some on. \nLiken it to a drug such as penicillin some people at an early age may be allergic to it but in later years they may not be. \n \nSo just because you couldn't role your tongue when you were young doesn't necessarily mean you didn't have the genes to do it (not that I think there are a necessary group of genes to do it), its just that these genes may not have been active \n \nLike everything else in life, its all down to chance. \n \nAnd Darwin wasn't a charlatan, he was a genus, not so sure about some of these geneticists though, you might be on to something there with some of those.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    Because I did and I couldn't do it and was told I lacked the 'magic gene', but then guess what, I learned how to do it a few years later, totally debunking the myth. \n \nThat's when I realised that geneticists and Darwinists were liable to be charlatans.  ",

	{'answer': u"\nyes i would take her to a nearby police station          \nYeah I won't help her. \nPrimarily because I don't want to be labelled paedophile. \nAnd I am too pretty for jail. \nHowever I can call cops to help her.          \ni'd leave it to a woman or teenage girl who wouldn't get accused of being a paedo and having a mob set on them          \nIn this sick, sad World we live in I suspect it will not be long before we see undesirables using their children as bait for well wishing people who genuinely want to help being held to blackmailing threats of being reported to the police if they do not pay demands for money. \n \nWould I help? Yes, I would otherwise society is being groomed by these people to abandon all decency. \n \nThe Government has lost all understanding of law and order, crime and punishment, with the nutters now running the asylum.          \nI have before now found a child looking lost outside a shop.  \nI stayed with him until a policeman arrived, at which point his mother appears from the shop. \nShe knew exactly where he was & who he was with. \nMe, a complete stranger.   \nShe's happy, she can shop without a child under her feet & the shop assistants told me she does the same thing week in, week out, teaching her child to lie if asked has 'he lost his mum'? \nNow days I would if I had time stand & watch for a while but what if I'm busy? \nLike all those people busy filing past 2 little girls & concentrating on a million other things.....catching a train, meeting someone on time, getting to work on time, what to do when they get to work. \nCan't really blame people for their ignorance, we live in a time when getting involved could back fire. \n \nNo good deed goes unpunished.          \nI would certainly be inclined to stop and be very concerned,but I would be worried about 1/ being accused of doing something to them and have your kindness thrown in your face and 2/ That its some kind of begging scam with an older person nearby.I think I would look out for a policeman/woman or similar,and if none around ring the police. Its not very responsible pulling such a stunt especially with girls of only 5 and 7 who are barely old enough to know the point of it all themselves ?          \nYes I would and always have. Those people were incredible, they should all be ashamed.          \nYes I would and have stopped but after hearing that gangs of pickpockets plant a lone child so that they can rush up and rob a person I would be wary now. I would probably now dial 999 and get the police to deal with it. \nWe had it drummed into us as children never to take sweets off of a stranger, go and look at a kitten or puppy or get in a car even if we knew the person. If in trouble to go into a shop or a lady in the street. Sadly though after Hindley and the Moors murders that was a no no. \nA lot of people are scared stiff now of being accused of abuse if they cuddled a frightened lost child or even worse if a man, accused of being a paedophile.  \nWhat a sad world we live in when someone is wary of helping a lost child in case they get robbed or accused of something.          \nI'd keep an eye out, and call the police, having a kid 'play' in the street is how Gypsy gangs rob people in Europe, so helping isn't an option anymore.          \ni found a young boy about 3 years ago in a tower block where i used to live,i took him straight to the concierges a the bottom of the flat i was'nt worried as the lifts are fitted with cctv,but in the street i would be wary.what a sad world we live in...          \nI think it would have to be a woman who stepped in to help. I say that with great sadness as I would hate to see a child suffering but I know only too well there are chances that I would be viewed with suspicion. \n \nOne sordid aspect of the modern world is by default all men are wicked.          \nI would have stopped and called the police          \nNo, because 1, she would blackmail me by saying I raped her.   2, her pimp would jump out with a gun and rob and maybe kill me.   You can pick her up.  I would call 911 and have them take care of her.          \nI think a female could stop and help \na man would have to be extremely careful,  maybe by pointing out the child to a woman passing by.          \nYou have to understand; it was London. \nWould the same have happened in, say, Leeds, or Newcastle. \nAs many have pointed out - society (and the actions of the media) since I've grown up, anyhow, have changed. Both sexes might have been able to 'get away' with asking kids if they were lost, or where their mother was, say 25 or so years ago - but not now. \nWe're British - and we HATE kids as a rule in any case (unless they're ours). The fact that they appear to have 'power' nowadays puts some adults under the cosh; think of them dressing like 'adults', and sneering and sulking if you tell them to 'walk before they can run'. \nI don't know about Brady/Hindley, Angelina - but wasn't people told that Myra a 'rarity'? Throughout the eighties, things were not all that bad, but I suspect the kiddy paranoia happened around the same time as hardship/immigration/crime...and of course nonces were still mostly - as they still are now...despite the late craze of Asian stalkers - Caucasians...and not only that, but close family members (or friends from the next street).          \nAbsolutely.  Just the other day I saw a little boy on a like-a-bike outside the school gates with no adult in charge.  There were a couple of women sitting chatting who had not noticed him and he was clearly a bit lost.  I started talking to him and asked a mum I knew if she recognised him, she didn't, but one of her kids said he was the little brother of a child in the school so I was able to identify his dad.

	 'question': u'\n    Firstly, I listen to a lot of Electronic music in General, Mainly Electro House and Dubstep at the moment and I have had a lot of earphones, in ear phones and headphones over the time and the best ones I ever had were the Beats Tour because the quality was just on another level. Using friends headphones or earphones I find that beats are generally much better then everyone else for the music type I listen to and was wondering: \r\n \r\nOut of all the beats on their Website, what are the differences between all of them? Eg. Beats Pro are like \xa3350 compared to Solo HD which are \xa3150 and the only thing Pro says it has more is noise cancellation, which im not bothered by and the Solo HD has a microphone built in. The build quality is obviously the factor but is it really worth \xa3200 more? And Pro and Studio sound identical. \r\n \r\nSecond, Are there any Headphones out there im missing which value for money, are better then beats? I do want the quality they offer though, even if it costs me. I have looked into it but beats seem to be value for money regardless of how many people hate on them or their large costs, it seems like the people who do hate on them also dont really take music seriously or love to listen to it. \r\n \r\nTL;DR What are the best value for money beats for Electronic music and are there any headphones who can rival beats quality but cost a little less? \r\n \r\nThanks for your time :)  ',

It WAS during final exams that he offered, so he should be able to understand why you turned down the offer. If it was rejection he felt, you\'ll relieve his tension on the matter.

He genuinely didn\'t get it.   As a guy I\'ll admit sometimes I just don\'t get when someone is trying to come one to me...so you have to be a little more blunt with it.  But, I\'m sure that part of him does feel pretty rejected...so you should probably take the initiative.          \nGuys can be as sensetive as girls =( He probably felt very close to you and liked you a lot. He probably isnt playing a game, he probably just feels hurt. Do you know ANY way to find him? You can look up his name on Facebook, a phone number or something? If you can get contact info- dont bring up the dinner anymore, ask him if he is free and invite him somewhere fun with you- like bowling or something. Tell him that you enjoy his company and he will know that you care too. =)          ',

He then asked me to go out to dinner with him in a couple of days while we were working on finals. When the day came and he asked if I still wanted to go out I said that I couldn't because I still had a lot to work on. And I swear I saw a flash of disappointment in his eyes. \r\n \r\nAnyway, just so he felt that I wasn't rejecting him, I hinted to him that it was a bummer that when never had that dinner. He didn't take the bait. Now that we don't have school together anymore we have communicated less and he is starting to become a little distant. \r\n \r\nIs he just playing the game, or does he actually feel rejected?

	{'answer': u"\nApply firm pressure to the cut and hold it for 20 minutes.          \nYou have no choice. Get to a hospital or a clinic. If it's lots of blood, call 911. Grounded is better than dead and the more you wait, the worse your condition will be and the angrier your mother will be. \n \nI'm sorry to hear you've got a mother like that.          \ntell your mum,  and don't do it again          \nPut pressure on it with a rag.          \nApply pressure to the wound. If bleeding continues, tell your mom and go to the hospital or doctors office. If it is REALLY BAD than tell your mom and call 911.  \nNEVER EVER EVER DO IT AGAIN!   EVER! \nMaybe just tell your mom and get some help          \nPut Vaseline over it. Vaseline helps cut off the blood flow. That's what I do. After the vaseline, put an icepack over it and apply firm pressure.The ice helps slow the blood flow. If you don't notice the bleeding slowing/stopping or you start feeling faint/lightheaded/dizzy, call 911 or get emergency help. I am in your situation, so I take all precautions so I never get caught by my parents.          \nThat should teach you a lesson. It's very stupid to cause harm to yourself. I advise you seeking professional help.          \nI know you don't want your Mom to find out, but you need to. You need help to find a way to deal with what ever is making you feel the need to self harm. It will never get better if you don't. There are people who can help you. My friend's daughter use to do this. She got help and is doing so much better. She is now either graduating HS or did and has a new job.          ",

	{'answer': u"\nYou'll get good answers from the experts and members at Askusweb.com          \ntry reaching out to a abused womens group , they often have resources available to help if you really want to leave , or maybe a church can help you . but i would say you need to get off the computer right now pack your belongings and go . or do yuou prefer to wait until he starts hitting and choking ? unless you are into the BDSM scene ?  you know your friend will help maybe reaching out to them  even though you feel reluctant . to do nothiiing means you are willing to accept that he might  mame or kill you someday .          \nYou can try a woman's shelter.  It's only temporary.  But have you tried just telling him that you think you have different goals?  Can you live on campus at your university?  A lot of schools have resources for off-campus housing.  It's hard to tell from what you described if this guy is really going to come after you or if he's just dominant.  You might also try to find work as a live in aid/companion or nanny and go to school part time.  It would give you a little money and a place to live until you figure things out.  Good luck!          \nYou need to get out but can only do it if you are ready.  Second step contact a women's abuse center.  They will help you develop a safe plan for leaving and they will help you get back on your feet without him.  I know in London they have special housing for those in need.  The shelter should be able to help you apply.  First step is you have to be ready.  I know I left my abusive husband and all I had was a part time job, 2 kids and the clothes on our backs.

You&#x27;ll be fine.          \nugly ? definitely not. \nskinny ? a little bit \n \noverall i find you attractive so just relax.          \nyou look to be an atractive young woman , with that being said i find the picture of you at the gym to show someone thatlooks to be a little under weight , but maybe thats the angles and such . your eyes shine like bright little gems in each of the pictures .. very sexy indeed. if your boyfriend cannot appriciate what he has  maybe its time to move on . remember however tho , no matter what you make your appearance on the outside it will only fixate people for so long . after that you will need charm and insight to maintain that fixation :D  i hope you can work out  the issues , no one wants to be alone but we all want to be loved ! \nBest of luck to you in life's journey wherever that may lead you          \nYou look very sexy to me. Have more self confidence.          \nBloody hell girl you are gorgeous!!! your problems with your bf most definitely have nothing to do with the way you look. You have absolutely no reason at all to be insecure about the way you look. I'm still quite stunned at how beautiful you are!! haha, any way good luck with your bf ask him what's going on? :)          ",

	{'answer': u'\nUm. I am availing the exception clause and remain silent.          \ni used to self harm when i was a child up to teenage years. usually after i had been severly scolded by either of my parents, and that was very frequent, im a lot older now and realized that it was becaude i was a bad person and felt guilty and had to punish myself          \nI have been given more in my life than I have ever, or quite possibly will ever, deserve.  Because there is no true cosmic retribution for this, I must inflict my own self-punishment (I also donate a lot of money, so, y\'know, I actually help the real world). \r\n \r\nThat, and I feel like a failure.  Which is probably why everyone does it, at their core.  Plus, something about self-harm is...karmically thrilling.          \nHi. I know this isn\'t answering your question, but please please please stop doing this to yourself. Self-harm won\'t benefit anyone and will definitely hurt your loved ones more than you. I was a cutter for the last two years and I stopped because I realized that this isn\'t worth it. Please just stop. Days will get better for you, trust me.          \nTo you and all the self harmers who may see this: \r\n \r\nStart slow \r\nInstead of a razor, put a rubber band around your wrist. Don\u2019t overdo it! \r\n \r\nBuy a punching bag and/or work out daily. \r\n \r\nWrite the names of people you care about where you usually cut. \r\n \r\nTry the Butterfly Project \r\n \r\n \r\nFind something (inanimate!) that you can draw on/rip/etc. \r\nSomething like a doll\u2026 Not a baby because that\u2019s weird o.O \r\nOr copy a picture of someone. Type into Google a star\u2019s name and edit their picture. \r\nAlso not a baby o.O \r\nOr you can just completely draw it from scratch. With the computer or on paper. \r\nMake them look how you see yourself. (Cuts/Burns/Bruises) \r\nWork hard on it! \r\nYou can email it to me if you\u2019d like. I\u2019d love to see your artwork. \r\n \r\nThe picture is solely for seeing what you do. But if you get a doll, it can also make you feel like you have something to take care of.  \r\n \r\nMake a pact with a friend in a similar situation. Like if you have a friend with an eating disorder tell them you won\u2019t cut if they start eating right.  \r\n \r\nMake goals for yourself.  \r\n \r\nBE LOUD!!  \r\nSCREAM!! \r\nWhen no one\u2019s home preferably o.O \r\n \r\nGet out of the house. Meet people. Make friends. Don\u2019t isolate yourself. \r\n \r\nMake yourself laugh.  \r\nDance. Sing. Express yourself. \r\nYou can do it =] \r\n \r\nYou can also call 1-800-273-TALK \r\nOr 1-800-DONT-CUT \r\n \r\nOr visit www.yourlifeyourvoice.org or www.twloha.com \r\n \r\nYou can talk to a counselor here: \r\n \r\n \r\nI\u2019m no professional, but you can email me if you\'d like to talk. \r\nPaige_Thomason@yahoo.com \r\nOr add me on Skype \r\nAwkwardTurtleDancer \r\nOr add me on Facebook \r\n  \r\nPlease give me your Yahoo!

Don\u2019t be a victim.          \ni used to do it and the reason was because i felt like the pain that i was feeling with the reality of life all went away wen i felt the real pain of cutting my wrist...          \nHere\'s my story.. I used to cut myself on my thighs when I was 16-17. I\'ve always been obese, and it really sucked growing up and being made fun of, and being the punchline of people\'s jokes. I felt so out of control with my life - friends were always disappearing when I needed them, and I felt absolutely hopeless for my future because I was very overweight and just getting bigger (over 300 lbs). I had a false sense of control when I cut, I felt like I could finally be in charge of how I feel. I knew I was in constant torment from bullies and just being a teen, and I wanted to be the one calling the shots. I\'d take disposable razors and crack them open with my teeth for the blades. I felt the rush, I felt empowered, but then a few minutes later, all I felt was WEAK, like I knew I was. Then one day, I told myself "This stops now. If I can\'t love myself, no one ever will." I never cut again, but I can still count around 40-50 scars on my thighs, including where I carved the word "UGLY". I am now 22, I have a lapband and I\'m losing weight, I\'m a nurse, I have a man who loves me, and certainly doesn\'t find me UGLY - and we are in control of our future, together.  \nSelf-harmers, remember, you are more important than you think, more beautiful/handsome than you know, and more loved than you can imagine.          \nI wouldn\'t say i\'m a self harmer, but i self harmed twice a couple months ago. \r\nMy reasons where purely cause i was depressed or angry.It hurt so much i had to tell my mum and she helped me put some cream on it. I stopped cause i realised how much my mum was affected by that, so i decided to suck up the pain emotionally not physically. Get counselling it helped me a lot and made me less negative and low.          \nI self harm because I want some kind of proof that I can still feel. It doesn&#x27;t matter if its pain. Anything is better than the normal day to day numbness.          \nI self harm because I hate myself.  I am a failure and I deserve it \n I **** everything up and I am just in everybodies way. I also self harm so I can feel something - anything besides how I feel all the time.          \nI went to boarding school and it really fucked me up...that\'s when I started self harming...I felt alone and worthless, realising how pointless my life is and how insignificant I am....Being trapped with my thoughts drove me insane...crying all the time, isolating myself....self harming helped take that pain away...provided a release from all that I couldn\'t tell anyone else..          \nBecause I&#x27;m a **** up in life, my family is broken, and I need to feel something.          \nI self harm because it&#x27;s like a way to balance out the emotional pain. Self harming releases endorphins that relieve stress, I have anxiety, so it helps me a lot. I don&#x27;t like doing it, but for now, it&#x27;s my escape. I don&#x27;t feel like I need to punish myself, I just need a release. I also have slight depression, which makes me depressed for no real good reason once in awhile, so it helps that too. My mom cheated on my dad, and home life isn&#x27;t so good, and along with other things I&#x27;m dealing with, so I&#x27;m dealing with a lot right now. So that&#x27;s why I self harm. Hope this was helpful.:)          \nYou are damaging a healthy body which someone with a life threaten disease really wants. It&#x27;s so selfish where kids younger than you are dying but love life. You are cutting a perfrctl good body. Some kids want to live. But they have aids. Cancer. Others. And you are being being mg selfish          \nWell here are my reasons: \nIf I&#x27;m really sad \nIf I&#x27;m really angry or stressed out \nTwice I have done it as self punishment (once when I tried talking to a girl I liked and I made a fool of myself, and once when I said something to my friend that I felt bad about)          ',

	{'answer': u'\nBuy your ticket in advance at www.thetrainline.com it is so much cheaper than buying at the station :)          \nOn line well in advance is almost always much cheaper \r\n          \nIf you prefer to stand in line to buy a ticket at the station...          \nIt is nearly always a lot cheaper to buy train tickets on line in advance of the journey. Normally the advance booking tickets include a seat reservation. \r\nBuying tickets at the station when you depart will cost more and you will also have to queue. You also risk having to stand up for the whole journey.   \r\nYou should not be paying "fees" for advance booking, just the fare.  \r\n \r\nIf you are being charged booking fees then you are on the wrong web site. Try www.nationalrail.co.uk or "thetrainline.com".  If you are buying from abroad (what country?) then you may be charged postage for the tickets to be sent to you, but this shouldn\'t be a high cost.  \r\nSome train companies ask you to collect advance booked tickets from a dispensing machine at the station.          \nThe trains that run from Gatwick Airport to London Bridge are run by First Capital Connect.  Avoid the trains run by Southern and Gatwick Express - they go to London Victoria.  For most of the day, you can buy a ticket at the station for \xa39.40 although it\'s more expensive between 7:30 and 9:30 in the morning.  There\'s usually a long queue at the ticket office, but you can also buy your ticket from a machine - they take Visa and Mastercard Credit Cards and sterling notes and coins. \r\n \r\nIf you won\'t be travelling for a few weeks, you may be able to find a cheaper ticket at   However, the very cheap ones are only available on one particular train and you may miss it if your flight is late.          \nFor this journey buying on line will be no cheaper than buying at the station despite all the answers above. Trains from Gatwick Airport to London Bridge run every 15 minutes (every 30 minutes on Sundays) and the journey takes about 30 minutes \nwww.nationalrail.co.uk \nHowever full the train is you will still be allowed on board; there are no advance reservations for this service          \nContrary to what the other people said, with the exception of some occasional special offers, Stations sell the same range of tickets as on the internet including Advance. \n \nHowever, it maybe easier to buy on line (but you you get less advice). You dont have to pay a booking fee online, just book with one of the train company websites and most of them (if not all) do not charge. \n \nIf the fares are of type "Advance" then you must buy them in advance whether online or at the station. You cannot get those tickets on the day of travel. \n \nTrainline.com DOES however charge. I dont know why people keep recommending them.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nWill ayone look \'down\' at you? I don\'t think so, you\'re pretty tall, even if you are really light. Don\'t worry, gyms are friendly places. Not everyone there is going to be in-shape. It\'s never to late to learn anything.          \nCheck out the gym and see how folks are. \n \nIf they judge you then you probably don\'t want to train there.  If they don\'t and you feel the instruction is good, folks are good to work with, and you like it then go there. \n \nI\'ve seen kids start martial arts as young as 5 or 6 and keep it up well into adulthood, and I know of someone who started in his 60s and earned a blackbelt in his 70s.  So age shouldn\'t be a factor. Likewise, there are folks of all sizes, shapes, etc in gyms so that shouldn\'t be a factor either.          \nIt doesnt matter its in the mind.          \nI will tell you something i tell all my students, something i tell my daughter and all my neices and nephews.  \n \n"No matter what you do or who you are in life, all our journey\'s and story has two things in common..a beginning and an end." \n \nWhether you are a champion or an amateur you all begin somewhere so no one looks down on other beginning their journey.  \n \nAs for your size, that means absolutely nothing in any form of martial art.          \nI think it\'s just the right time and come on! don\'t be nervous. All great fighters came from this humble beginnings.          \nFunnily enough I sound the exact same build as you and had the same nerves before I started MMA. The great thing about MMA gyms I feel is that nobody has a bad ego! I was treated is full respect even though I didn&#x27;t exactly look the part. Start today!!!          ',

I want to join for self defense purposes but also for fitness.  \nWhat should I expect? I am willing to push myself to the limit.  \nHow much do the prices generally vary?

	{'answer': u"\nThere's no advantage. The disadvantage is that each of the 2 blades is much weaker than a single blade of the same weight as the 2 put together. \nThat thing is just for show.  No real swordmaker would produce it.          \nOne disadvantages I see is the sword being more brittle. I say one hit from a good solid sword ill break the blade.

	{'answer': u"\nif it is for style fake ones if you want style and good music get real ones          \nGet $110 ones open box off of onecall. Even thats pretty overpriced for them tho. Get sennheisers or ultrasones or grados or something. Ultrasone Hfi-580's are pretty sick looking too so those might be worth checking out. @jingjong: audio technica's can be gotten off amazon in the us and are a great choice also.          \nBeats is actually a terrible pair of headphones. For $80 you can easily get a better sounding set.          \nIf you don't need that $50 desperately, you might want to get the refurbished one. Sometimes refurbished headphones are even better than new ones as they might be just in their best conditions. Headphones need some time before each parts of them work together well. But for fake ones, they are completely different things. If you only have $80, I suggest get something else like Sennheiser or Audio-technica (one of favorite brand, they are nice and cheap but probably they can only be found in Japan).          ",

	{'answer': u'\nThey don\'t always stamp tickets now. If it has gone through an electronic barrier and the magnetic strip thus read it will not work again.          \nYou are required to show your railcard when your ticket is inspected on the train. If your boyfriend uses one that was purchased with a railcard he is likely to be surcharged at least the full fare. It may not say  on the ticket that your need to produce the railcard, but it will certainly say so on the documentation that came with the railcard.          \nYou don\'t say what type of railcard or whether it is a concessionary railcard or simply a purchased one. \r\nIf you purchased the ticket at a concessionary rate using the railcard (showing to the ticket clerk to get the concession), it is kind of understood that any inspector checking your concessionary ticket will also want to see the railcard as evidence that you are entitled to the concessionary rate. \r\nThis is set out in the terms and conditions for the railcard and is most probably printed on the railcard itself          \nIf you used a railcard to buy it, it will have a railcard code in the top left, second line down if I remember rightly... something like FAM for family railcard 1625 for 16-25 railcard, SNR for senior railcard, and so on. \r\n \r\nThe rule that you need to show your railcard is contained in the National Rail Conditions of Carriage which form part of your contract for all National Rail tickets.          \nRemember this before you send your used ticket to your boyfriend, on the rear of the ticket it will state non transferable, so the moment you send this off to your boyfriend, the place where you bought it from with the time purchased is printed on the ticket, if your boyfriend gets challenged and if they want to delve further into the investigation because he has no railcard they can bring up footage of YOU buying the ticket, you could both be done for fraud and a serious heavy fine, so is a small fee of the price of a ticket really worth the potential fine and criminal record. I check tickets as part of my job and if I find passengers with railcard discounts I ask for the railcard, if they do not have it (especially young persons railcards as these are usually the ones you normally associate with fraudulent use), I will take the ticket off them and make them pay the full standard fare regardless of what time of day, if they refuse to pay there is usually a member of the BTP either on train or at the next station and they don\'t take to kindly to fare evasion.  \r\nSo please think carefully before you enter into this fraudulent activity, you could affect your future just by trying to save a few quid.          \nIf you buy a ticket with a railcard you must carry the railcard with the ticket and show it if asked by the guard or ticket inspector. \r\n \r\nWithout the railcard it isn\'t valid and you will be charged the full fare for the journey. \r\n \r\nAnd the others are right, you could also both also be prosecuted for fraud.          \nYou don\'t state what Railcard you have used if it has the following in the right hand of your ticket.. \r\n \r\nYP = Young Persons/16-25 \r\nFam = Family Railcard \r\nRCD = Forces Railcard \r\nNew = New Deal Railcard \r\nDSB = Disabled \r\nThis will be displayed on the front of the ticket, it does not state on the ticket, but it does on the terms and conditions when you purchased your railcard, that you will at all times carry your railcard, so if the train guard asks your boyfriend for the railcard and he cannot produce he may be liable to pay the full single fare for his journey, plus also train tickets strictly by the book are non transferable, \r\n \r\nIf however he wishes to purchase the same Railcard you have, providing it\'s not RCD, DSB or NEW then he may be able to use it          \nIf you bought the ticket with a Railcard and its got the railcard code in the top left hand corner i.e. Y-P then the best thing to do would be to get the ticket excessed before the date of travel (excessed means pay the difference between the railcard discounted fare and the non-discounted fare. \r\n \r\nTechnically rail tickets are non-transferable however there\'s absolutly no way of this being enforced \r\n \r\nHowever if he attempts to use the ticket as it is at present, then he will almost certainly be charged for a new Full price single ticket (the most expensive available) and if he\'s caught by a Penalty Fare Collector (if travelling in a penalty fare area)  then he could be prosecuted or made to pay double the Full single fare \r\n  \r\nI really wouldn\'t advise it at all, as there are many methods of getting cheap rail tickets (split ticketing/advance fares/rail rangers/rover tickets) and you could always get the ticket refunded (unless it\'s an "advance" ticket) although it would be subject to a \xa310 admin fee.

	{'answer': u"\nswords are more stylish if you ask me...          \nIt depends how close you are. If its sniper vs. dagger, it depends how close you are. 100 meters away, the sniper owns, but 1/2 a meter away, the sniper is skrewed.          \nCompared to a gun a sword is rather slow.  A single pull of the trigger is all that is required to strike while a sword requires a great deal more movement and effort to utilize.  And while anyone who owns a gun should be reasonably well trained, it does not require hours of daily practice to hit a man sized target across the room.  A sword requires a completely different type of skill and greater physical conditioning to utilize with any efficiency. \r\n \r\nAs for style, there are guns engraved and with gold inlays to rival any sword.  I just saw last night were S&W has been commissioned to create two guns for each state with the new state quarters done in gold on eac side of the gun.  Those 100 guns will take more than two years to complete.  The workmanship I saw was excellent.          \nRange, accuracy and precision are important, but a sword takes more training and skill to use, even more so if you are fighting someone else armed with a sword. Swords don't run out of ammo. Swords dont jam.  There is no advantage to decoration with jewels and inscriptions as you said, but you can do the same for a gun. I run my own martial arts school and I am also in the military so I train and use both. I would certainly say the sword takes more skill to use properly and effectively. I can put an M-16 in anyones hand and give them 5 minutes of instruction and they can hit the target, but I cannot do the same with a sword. It takes years of practice.          \nIf you are close to use a sword  u to close a gun just stand back and it's over          \nSimple! Guns rans out of bullets!!:)          \nA sword is more stylish and can do a lot of damage up close. But a gun looks more intimidating and can do a lot of damage up close and far away.          \nSwords: \r\nDisadvantages: feeling someone get killed. \r\nAdvantages:  You don't waste a bullet. \r\nGun: \r\nDisadvantage: \r\nYour angle has to be precise, range and precision. \r\nAdvantage:  \r\n:(          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Swords have unlimited hits depending on the person while a gun is just limited by its size, noise despite what you use to muffle it.

	{'answer': u"\nLook at the TFL website          \nHello  \r\nI think its still called a all day travel card and they cost anywhere from \xa311.00 to \xa319.00 check these websites should give you a better idea hope they help. \r\n  \r\n          \nYou need a one-day Travelcard.  It's cheaper if you each get an Oyster card and have a Travelcard put on it.  The number of zones you need depends on where you plan to go. You'll find a map of the zones here.   It's easiest to buy your Oyster card and Travelcard in a newsagents, but they also sell them at train and underground ticket offices.          \nThere's a list of ticket prices for 'Day Anytime' or 'Day Off-Peak' on the link below: \n \n          \nyou should study the TFL website carefully \r\nif necessary send them an email mate...          \nDo you really need an 'all zones' ticket?  If you do, then for one day, an off peak zones 1 - 6 is \xa38 (travel after 9.30 a.m.) or \xa315 for before 9.30 a.m. per day. \r\n \r\nThere are tickets which go further out.  Do you really need to travel that far?  Are you sightseeing?  If so, most of the attractions and shopping is in zones 1 - 2 which is \xa36.60 off peak and \xa38 peak per day.          \nIt sounds like you're going from outside of London. I'd just suggest buy a London day travelcard from wherever it is that you're going from. That will get you to&around London, as well as back to your home town. \r\n \r\nE.g. I live in Bognor Regis, so I just go on southernrailway.com and get a ticket from bognor to 'london all zones travelcard' which is usually 16-18 pounds. They have a 25% discount online know so should be even cheaper. \r\n \r\nYou can use that travelcard to go on tube and buses around London + to and from london on a train.          \nyou can buy a payg oyster card for \xa35 then use it for two days.The fare is capped so when it reaches its higher limit you get the rest for free. Then when your finished with it take it back and get your \xa35 back          \nTry this page from the TFL site: http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tickets/14416.aspx It lists all the travel cards and tickets by zone coverage and gives the prices for tickets according to whether you buy a paper ticket or use an Oyster card. The Oyster card costs about \xa33 I think but can be reused over and over again and you can put travel cards and cash value on there. If you start out with cash value on your card it will cap it at the price of a daily travel card at the end of that day. I hope that makes sense and is helpful. \r\n \r\nhttp://concretemoomin.wordpress.com          \nA one day all zones travelcard costs \xa38. It is valid on the Underground, buses, London Overground, \r\nNational rail, light rail and trams within the zones 1-6. If you are staying in central London a Zone 1 and 2 travelcard will be sufficient (\xa36.50)          \nlook at a tube map and see what zone pass you need . you may be better to get an oyster card and just top it up as you need it I know the tube can sometimes get confusing to visitors . have a nice trip          ",

	{'answer': u"\nLondon Pass --  Great to get this ahead of time... \r\nThe Top Tourist Attractions FREE With London Pass.  London Pass includes transport within London Transport Zones 1-6. 1 Day adult pass = 35GBP / 1 day child pass = 22GBP \r\n          \nI went to London recently and bought a day travel card from a newsagent for travel between 9 am and 4.00 pm (?). For an adult it was \xa35.70 for any bus or tube. I thought it was good value.          \nabout 9-11\xa3          \nHi I word for London transport a 1 day travel card for an adult is \xa36.50 a child under the age of 14 travels completely free any time of day any day of week  \r\nhave a great time in London travelling on tube docklands railway and buses for the one price of \xa36.50 per adult  \r\nTravel anywhere within the London transport network          \nI would say get a travelcard. These are available at London Newsagents, Underground Stations and even some hotels! This is by far the cheapest way around London and saves time buying tickets etc          \nNot one day travel card. \r\nYou buy family travel card. \r\nIt is far cheaper. \r\nIf you double talk to ticket window at the underground station.          \nYou need one day travelcards (valid after 09-30am weekdays, anytime weekends). If you're just sticking to the central London sites Zone 1 &2 cards will suffice. If for example you were going to travel out to Hampton Court an all zone 1-6 travelcard would be required. Travelcards are of course valid on buses as well and on the suburban rail system within the zones covered by your ticket.          \nFamily tickets don't exist any more. \r\nChildren under 14 travel free on buses, but a child travelcard costs \xa32 per day. Oh, and up to 4 children can travel with an adult with a travelcard for \xa31 each. \r\nIf you two adults pay \xa33 to get an Oyster card and then add a weekly travelcard onto it, it should be cheap. However, if you're not staying for long, then you should do pay-as-you-go travel on your Oyster. \r\nAnd for travelling around central London, I've always found that a Zones 1-4 travelcard will get you almost everywhere (Zones 5-6 are usually on the suburbs, which you don't need). \r\nIt's \xa35.40 for a one day travelcard, if I can remember correctly.          \nEach adult can get a travel card for the day & if the children stay with you (& stay under 11) then they should be able to travel for free. You're probably best asking at the ticket office when you set off.  \r\n \r\nAnother thing - the science & natural history & V&A museums are next to each other.          ",

	{'answer': u'\nok i know you said no Taylor Swift, but I\'ve been learning to play Our Song and its crazy easy. No capo, about 4 chords, same chord progression throughout, the strumming pattern is the only thing that changes. linkage:  \r\n \r\nthen just watch one of her acoustic performances on youtube to figure out strumming patterns.  \r\n \r\nand while you\'re at it, i\'ve found guitarnoise.com to be insanely helpful. You can learn songs by bob dylan, johnny cash, neil young, pink floyd quick and easy, and its really comprehensive and friendly to beginners, aha trust me I\'d know, you don\'t get much more beginner than me lol          \nHEY i just started playing guitar about a week ago and i suggest you get a capo. you can get one for around 10 bucks at target (where i got mine) or any store like that. i only know 1 song so far. it\'s Billy Currington\'s People are Crazy. 1st of all if you get a capo you can learn the intro to the song in about 5-10 minutes. you put the capo on the 5th fret and you only use the b string the whole time and 1 g. i suggest you go to freeandeasyguitar.com and look up "people are crazy" because the guy teaches you the intro and song real good. when i learned how to play the intro i felt so accomplished lol. its a good way to start off and get a feel of how to play guitar. the song takes more time to learn but if you cant get a capo play the actual song with no capo. theres only 4 chords and they repeat. Again, look the website up its really good. look for the song or look for other beginner songs. if you do look at the video he plays the song capoed so dont get confused. you\'ll have to look up the uncapoed version separately. hope i didnt confuse u lol. make sure you hold those strings down hard when you play the intro. your fingers will hurt but you\'ll get used to it. learning the intro makes you better at shifting between chords and makes your fingers used to the irritation from playing so much. so start small from this intro and work your way up to this song and then other songs. HOPE YOU GET A CAPO AND TAKE MY ADVICE BECAUSE THE INTRO TO THIS SONG IS AS EASY AS GUITAR GETS. GOOD LUCK!          \nI\'ve been playing for 4 months, and I\'m fairly good. Better than some family relatives who\'ve been playing for a while. You can buy capos in many stores that sell musical instruments. And you know, you don\'t really need a capo for it to sound just like the song. It just has a slightly lower pitch, you can barely tell if it\'s like on the 2nd or 3rd fret. But most of Taylor\'s songs are super easy. Like Our Song, Stay Beautiful, I\'d Lie, Tied Together With a Smile, Mary\'s Song(Oh My My My), The Best Day, A Place in This World, Tim McGraw. Nearly all her songs have only 3 or 4 chords so it\'s easy to remember. Sorry if you said no Taylor Swift but her songs are most of the ones I play.          \nif you go to ultimate-guitar.com you can find anything you want..ive been playing for a few weeks and im actually pretty good. its really helpful. :) \r\nhappy playing!          \nmost Taylor Swift songs are very easy to play. I was just like that when I started playing. Then I went to this website  Then type in a song name or a band name (make sure to change it to bad name.) \r\n \r\nI know you said don\'t suggest Taylor Swift songs but that\'s how i learned and I am now pretty good! I first learned Should\'ve Said No, then Our Song.  \r\n \r\nSome easy songs w/o capos are: Our Song, Should\'ve said No, Picture to Burn, White Horse, and many more! \r\n \r\nHope I could help and guitar is really fun and i hope you enjoy!

	{'answer': u"\nThe nitrogen cycle is the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various chemical forms. This transformation can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen, making it the largest pool of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle. \n \n \nScrew your question, learn about the Nitrogen cycle          \nThe most intelligent of races in the world is the race who knows how to live in peace with other races !

	{'answer': u"\nYes you can but travel after 10am and not between 4 and 6pm to avoid higher fares          \nWith it being a short journey your train ticket should be the same price on the day so you'll be fine buying at the station. Although, you may want to book online on the day so that you can pre-book a seat and have less worries about ticket office queues and confusion at the station. You will just need to rock up and collect your tickets from one of the machines in the station. I think you need to book 2 hours in advance though so that the tickets have time to be processed ready for picking up.  \r\n \r\nOne other thing, living in Birmingham you're eligible for the two together railcard. You can read about it here http://help.thetrainline.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/386/kw/railcard but the gist is that if there are two of you travelling you can save 1/3 on rail fares.          \nYes, you can buy at the station by cash.

	{'answer': u'\nIf you want good headphones get beats.

	{'answer': u"\nBecause the government is just rubbish. My season ticket cost over \xa33400 per year to travel on trains that are late, dirty, unairconditioned and now the basterds are going on strike for a week starting the 21st. \r\n \r\nFrankly I stand the lot of them up against the wall and shoot every man Jack of 'em. \r\n \r\nIf the trains in Germany ran like the British ones they'd ACT with Teutonic efficiency to sort them out.          \nare they that expensive, i mean buy a ticket each day and then you will see how cheap the season ticket. well if you want to compare us with Europe remember the french in the past were spending 7 times as much on there railways. at the same time the tory government was stopping all investment in our railways so as to make them look like a good investment. and we are still paying the price for this. so next time  david Cameron is on your door step ask him how he will give us railways like the french with out spend very large some of our money. OH! he wants to keep our taxes down. you have to pay one way or another so get a life. so more tax better trains schools health service etc less tax you will have to pay some when. \r\nso please let me know who has the answer i will vote for them but if you want better quality of life so do the workers on the railways, health service \r\n bin men, etc so don't expect them to work for pennies.          \nActually they are losing money on season tickets. That means that they lose revenue by keeping a seat open for you instead of selling it repeatedly.          \ntell me about it, i live in london, go uni in cambridge, 3 days a week, even with a student rail, which they do not accept cos i wud have to travel early in order to get uni in time. it will cost me \xa320 for a return. your spot on mate. so expensive. rails are just ripoffs          \nWe have some of the most expensive peak hour fares in Europe certainly and they need to be reduced. We also have some of the cheapest advance purchase leisure fares in Europe and certainly one of the densest and most frequent networks in Europe. Governments do nothing but screw more and more money out of people to employ more and more lazy civil servants, to fight more and more futile wars etc. Were the railways re-nationalised they'd spend more money on \r\nclosing lines, cutting jobs and making redundancy payments, not on lowering fares.          \nIf you think it's too expensive, why don't you drive a car instead?  Oh, yes, that would be even more expensive.   \r\n \r\nTrains are expensive to operate.  You either pay more to live in London and have an easier commute, or you move away and get a cheaper house and spend money on transport.  You can't have it both ways.          \nSimple supply and demand.  \r\nLots of pepole want to travel at peak times, expanding capacity beyond its current level would needed very expensive works taking years before they had any effect. \r\nReducing the fares on busy commuter lines would just lead to worse overcrowding as there is no space for any more trains.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I live (if you can call it that) and work in London. I want to move out to find more affordable accommodation and have a better quality of life. However, to do so I would make no savings whatsoever, because of the exorbitant cost of rail season tickets to commute back into London. Why even though we have one of the worst and most expensive rail networks in Europe does the Government do nothing to significantly reduce the cost of rail travel in England?  ',

	{'answer': u"\nsceince ?          \nNo.          \nNo. \n \nThe actual reason is because the bible was written by highly superstitious people who lived long before the Age of Information and the birth of knowledge.          \nFun???? \nExcept for a few hot sex scenes, there is no FUN in the bible.  \nMost of us aren't joking when we point out the obvious flaws in the stories it contains. \nSo, the short answer is no, he isn't correct. \nWhy would you think we elected that guy to speak for us?          \nNot at all.

I was emotional that day. : P \r\n \r\n10.Does your favorite genres fans have tension with other genres fans? Not like violent i just mean like how the Punks make fun of Emo and vise versa? If so do you take part in it? Not really... there\'s tension between Nirvana fans and GNR fans, though.          \nThis is the best freaking idea ever! \r\n \r\n1: The Pixies. At first, I thought they sucked just because of their image. Then I heard them and the rest is history. \r\n \r\n2: Nine Inch Nails, The Pixies, L7, and Primus.  \r\n \r\n3: Dealing with not taking drug\'s and the fame, pressure, and drinking and band members. \r\n \r\n4:  Joan Jett. Guilty Pleasure. Big Time. \r\n \r\n5: The Ramones. I mean I tryed to like them so many time\'s but it never work\'s. \r\n \r\n6: No Siblings. Life rules. =P \r\n \r\n7: All of my friends. Every single one! And my parents. \r\n \r\n8: Grudge or Sludge Rock. Glam also, don\'t know why. \r\n \r\n9: Kurt Cobain\'s Last Words on Youtube. It\'s so sad when he just stop\'s mid sentence and dies. =( \r\n \r\n10: Yes and no, I don\'t. I do tease Tokio Hotel fan\'s though. Big hair. *shudders*          \nAmen! lol, you should run for r&p president. XD \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now? \r\nDefinitely a lot of indie bands like Peter Bjorn & John \r\n \r\n2.What bands do you think are not mentioned enough here? \r\nI would say Into Eternity...A lot more but I\'m glad people don\'t talk about my favorites because then they\'d just be criticized \r\n \r\n3.What do you think is the hardest part of being a rock star? \r\nI\'ve never been one so I dunno. \r\n \r\n4.Any artists you try to hate but really like? \r\nDon\'t laugh...but Cobra Starship \r\n \r\n5.Any artists you try to like but really hate? \r\nNone really. \r\n \r\n6.If you have siblings what music do they like? \r\nBoth of my brothers are just into hip hop. \r\n \r\n7.besides R&P who do you normally have music conversations with? \r\nOnline or in real life?  \r\n \r\n8.What genre do you think will make a comeback in the next decade or two? \r\nHair metal? XD \r\n \r\n9.Are there any songs/videos/interviews by/of bands you like that make you so sad you cant watch them? \r\nThere was an old interview I saw with Pin Floyd when Syd Barrett was still in the band...it made me pretty sad. \r\n \r\n10.Does your favorite genres fans have tension with other genres fans? Not like violent i just mean like how the Punks make fun of Emo and vise versa? If so do you take part in it? \r\nNot at all...I don\'t really care what other people have to say about my favorite genre. \r\nI\'m not going to lie though...I used to always make fun of Nu-metal. =/          \nI never answer any of Man Egg\'s questions and I\'ve already reported a couple of his questions so I totally agree with you. \r\n \r\n1. For some unknown reason I used to really dislike Radiohead. Then I bought Pablo Honey because of *sighs* Creep. From there on I started to like them more and more and for the past few years they\'ve been one of my fave bands. \r\n \r\n2. Bikini Kill, Breeders, Dinosaur Jr, Public Image Limited, Stone Roses, Husker Du, Joy Division, Minor Threat, Rites Of Spring, Fugazi \r\n \r\n3. Dealing with paparazzi and the constant media attention, \r\n \r\n4. I don\'t like Bono that much but I do like some of U2\'s songs. However I still think they\'re one of the most overrated bands ever. \r\n \r\n5. Not really. \r\n \r\n6. I\'m a spoiled only child so I don\'t have any brothers or sisters. My parents don\'t listen to much music at all and the little that they do listen to is absolutely horrible. \r\n \r\n7. Just my friends really \r\n \r\n8. Hopefully punk as there aren\'t really any proper punk bands around. I just wish that Fugazi would come out of hiatus. \r\n \r\n9. When I listen to Twenty Four Hours or Decades by Joy Divison. They\'re brilliant songs but it\'s really sad since they were only released two months after the death of Ian Curtis. \r\n \r\n10. I like every genre of music expect for pop and most dance music so I don\'t really get into fights over genres.          \ni don\'t really answer those questions anyway..unless they\'re really amusing..i always wonder why other people even bother. \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now?..not really..some i am unsure of \r\n \r\n2.What bands do you think are not mentioned enough here?

	 'question': u"\n    I know this has been said before but..... \r\n \r\nEveryone knows trolls are just here for attention, a few trolls can be funny but we have way to many here and its making regulars want to leave. I think if we boycott the trolls we can see a 10-40% decrease in trolls for the next few weeks. I think we sould try ignoring them and see how it works. I'm not taking about cool trolls like Fingertoes or Henry Rollins i'm talking about Man Egg and co. So my idea is that we just stop answering Man Egg and cos questions and some of them will go away.I know we report them and they get suspended but they just create new accounts. If we ignore them they might go away. I think most regulars can agree that trolls like Fingertoes and Johnny Rotton are cool because they are creative and witty. But Man Egg and his friends and/or other accounts are not creative. So basically if you want to boycott just do the following... \r\n \r\n1.Dont answer questions by trolls that are uncreative, boring,or tastelessly offensive. \r\n \r\n2.Dont respond to trolls trying to get a reaction out of you by being racist, homophobic etc. \r\n \r\n3.Report man egg type rants. \r\n \r\nSo if you agree please star this question! \r\n \r\nand so this isn't spam here is a mini music survey... \r\n \r\n1.Are there any artists/bands you decided you hated before really hearing their music and then you heard their music and like them now? \r\n \r\n2.What bands do you think are not mentioned enough here? \r\n \r\n3.What do you think is the hardest part of being a rock star? \r\n \r\n4.Any artists you try to hate but really like? \r\n \r\n5.Any artists you try to like but really hate? \r\n \r\n6.If you have siblings what music do they like? \r\n \r\n7.besides R&P who do you normally have music conversations with? \r\n \r\n8.What genre do you think will make a comeback in the next decade or two? \r\n \r\n9.Are there any songs/videos/interviews by/of bands you like that make you so sad you cant watch them? \r\n \r\n10.Does your favorite genres fans have tension with other genres fans?

Not that I recall, but I rarely remember my dreams.   \n4.  No.   \n5.  Witches if they\'re Hermione Granger types as opposed to the Wicked Witch types.   \n6.  a couple of smooth rocks.   \n7.  Funny \n8.  Werewolves \n9.  She\'s okay.  My favorite is probably "Complicated." \n10.  Smart girls \n11.  same as 3.   \n12.  I don\'t know enough tennis section people yet.

I\'m not sure, I have been into tennis since a very young age and can\'t even remember the first time I watched tennis... I assumed that I loved it from the start \n2. I had spent the majority of my yahoo answers life in the parenting section, I loved the tennis section from the start - people here seem to be a little more light hearted and you can joke around a bit without being severely thumbs downed. I also loved the fact that trolls don\'t seem to live in the tennis section \n3. No unfortunately I haven\'t \n4. When I want to turn a light off or want something that is away from arms reached I will stare at it immensely or wave my arms about shouting enchantments hoping in vain that it will turn off/ come flying at me. Despite that I do believe in will get my magic powers one day \n5. Witches... The nice ones like Hermione Granger  \n6. Particular wrist band that I never take off - don\'t know if it\'s lucky or not but I can\'t function without it \n7. Settle for the best of both words and be \'witty\'? \n8. Vampires \n9. Yes I do - love both her new and old, but my favorite would be \'what the hell?\' \n10. Tall guys - I\'m quite tall myself and don\'t like dating shorter guys, that\'s why I married my husband.., luckily he\'s strong as well \n11. My husband is in my dream frequently so I definitely do. When I was still at university and he was my boyfriend I frequently spent much of my study time daydreaming and fantasizing about him and the life we could create :/ \n12. Lana or Sapphire, because they love Rafa as much as I do! \n13. No I\'m enjoying it , sometimes these things ask hard questions and I give up but managing pretty good so far  \n14. To be honest Azarenka was the first top female player I have ever seen wear shorts - they looked good, but I guess I prefer dresses \n15. I do miss Rafa\'s old style. That is the style o fell in love with, so I will say without sleeves, I love his guns! \n16. Lopez \n17. Don\'t hate either of them!  \n18. Psychologist - which is what I am. But when I was playing tennis competitively as a child I did hope to break through on the pro circuit.. Injuries and lack of any amazing talent (I was good but not really good) held me back \n19. I really can\'t stand anyone touching my neck which I think might come from the fact that my biggest fear is that I will suffocate - drowning (though it doesnt stop me swimming) or being strangled or being decapitated really scare me  \n20. As long as it\'s not one of the unforgivable \n21. Not sure when they will meet again, but the French Open is Rafa\'s (please just let us have the French or Wimbledon and Nole can have the rest - just let him have one grand slam please :P) \n22. Don\'t sing in the shower \n23. About a 3, this survey and bargain hunt are keeping me entertained at the moment - doesn\'t take much to entertain me it\'s currently 1.24am here \n24. Is it Nole\'s favorite number, I\'m not really sure \n \n \nI have a question for you? What did you think about the woman who snatched Nole\'s shirt off that young girl at the Australia Open after the final? \n \n \nEDIT just read somewhere that the lady who snatched it auctioned it for charity and the young girl got the shirt back, I\'m glas she got the **** but she shouldn\'t of hate to pay $5500 for it \n \n          \n1.

You\'re competing with my lenght. Anyway answers! \n \n \n1. What did you first think when you watched tennis? Boring. I remember my aunt complaining about the William sisters winning everything, then I got into it about a year or two later. It was such a massive contrast looking back, considering how I felt nothing for it, yet now I lurrrv it. \n \n2. What was your first thought when you came on Tennis Section? I don\'t know. I was just like what do I put to not sound like some great big badonkadonk. \n \n3. Did you ever have a dream with tennis player in it? Can\'t remember. \n \n4. Do you believe in magic? Yeah. Well the paranormal and witchcraft, spirits and all. I believe in the occult, but not santa and such. \n \n5. Witches or Fairies? Witches! \n6. What\'s your lucky charm? My hotness. I don\'t know, nothing. I have a few birth stones, I gues those are considered "luckaay".  \n  \n7. Being smart or being funny? Smart. \n8. Vampires or Werewolves? Vampires. \n \n9. Do you like Avril? If yes which is your favorite song by her? I used to, before she got lame and came out with "girlfriend" and became all pinkifyed. Her first album was good though. Probably "I\'m with you" or "complicated". \n \n10. Strong or tall guys? / Smart or funny girls? I don\'t know. You gotta be strong and tall and funny and smart. If your boring yet clever that\'s no fun, but if your funny and a complete *** brain then theres no hope either. I\'d probably say Funny girls and strong dudes. \n \n11. Do you ever dream of love? No. I\'ve thought about it, but I don\'t really like the idea of having a relationship in any point of life, now or later. Sexy time on the side is all you need. Relationships just screw people up. Friends are enough :) \n \n12. If you could chose any person from tennis section to live near to you, and to know her in real life, who would it be? - You, you\'re the nicest. Even though you say you\'re a witch XD. Anyway yeah, I could see us getting along well. Cait seems cool too. Kevin seems nice, he shares similar interests to me so I guess that could work. Megadan is nice as well. Florial is real nice. Erh Luka is nice too XD. I\'d probably get along best with you and him Serbians FTW ;O. oo and Safa, shes nice, oin.. Lol that\'s some long *** list of people. Ah I don\'t know. Ok You, Luka, Cait, Kevin and Platy. David\'s alright too. JBFP and Mexi are charismatic enough. Oh lordy I don\'t who to put. Probably you since your the nicest. Luka because hes really chatty and we could talk for hours. I harass cait with Best answers, telling her she\'s got swag and how swanky she is.  So I think you three. I think I\'d annoy Luka and Cait abit though. Maybe florial too, I don\'t know her very well but we\'ve talked a few times and she seems on level with you in terrms of niceness. Lol what buffoonery did I just type up. Jaaaaaaaaaaysus. Anyway probably you since you is a nice Pisces fish lady.  \n \n \n13. Is this long? :P Not as long as mine :X \n \n14. Female players in shorts or in skirts? Skirts! Shorts look better on men. Skirts are sexay on the lady, shorts are sexay on the man. Simples. Ayeeeeeeee. \n \n15. Rafa with sleeves or without? Without, he looked pretty good then. Now he just looks odd. \n \n16. Jo or Lopez? Lopez.  \n \n17. Tomic or Schiavone? (who do you hate more, if you hate them) - Schiavone. People complain about Masha and Vika\'s grunts  but hers is far worse. Tomic seems okay. \n \n18. What\'s your dream job? Mental health or something media based. \n \n19. What\'s your biggest fear? Losing people close. \n20. Can I put spell on you? :P. Sure.  \n \n21. How many matches in row will Rafa lose to Nole before getting one? 2. \n22. Do you sing under shower, if yes what? Yeah. Talk, sing, all things vocally possible. \n \n23. How bored on scale 1-10 are you right now? =P 5. \n24. Do you know why did I put 24 questions? Ah its over :\'O \n \nIt\'s fine lol. Yours was more in-depth :)          \ntennis is boring          ',

	{'answer': u'\nYes you can book a ticket in advance from a rail station.          \nSince you haven\'t bothered to tell us where you are or which station you are talking about, I am entitled to assume you are talking about my local train station, in which case the answer is No.          \nyes but the earlier the cheaper          \nYes - not only can you book your ticket in advance but at main stations you can book a ticket of any type between ANY two points and not necessarily from the station you\'re booking from. This is despite the usual sarcastic answer from someone the other side of the world wanting to know the "ins-and-outs" of everything all the time.          \nYes you can but doing it online is even easier -   - and may be a little cheaper too.          \n@Timbo - thetrainline were unable to substantiate their claim that they are cheaper. Indeed they are more expensive than virtually any other website because the latter don\'t charge booking fees. \r\nI\'m not sure how much sock puppetry is going on here but this false claim is being consistently peddled despite the ASA stating the ad was misleading and banned it from broadcast. \r\n \r\n@OP: Yes you can. You can book tickets up to twelve weeks in advance, this includes all types of tickets between any two stations in the country and, by extension, allows for split tickets to be bought in one transaction.

Time to replace the speaker, or throw the whole thing out.          \nYour multimeter simply is not accurate enough to read the coil resistances accurately. \n \nYou need a meter that reads to tenths of an ohm, or preferably 100ths of an ohm, to get sensible readings. \n \nThe actual resistances could be anything from less than an ohm on high power speakers to probably 2 - 4 ohms on a tiny speaker - it depends on the coil design & wire gauge used.

	{'answer': u'\nthese tickets are usually valid all day, but not before a certain time.  \r\nAsk at the ticket office in Liverpool Street Station.          \nIt will only have times for trains for which you are booked. Some parts of your journey may not be bookable. \r\n \r\nYou should only have one fare ticket for the outwards journey and one for return and will cover the whole journey,          \nI should think you\'d check your routing and booking with the railway.          \nThe 7:10 train probably has the time restriction on the tickets issued because of rush hour crowding on that service. It may not be crowded at Ipswich but it will probably become so later on. The company will try and spread their passenger load across the rush hour period so they specify validity times on advance purchase tickets. These are often accompanied by compulsory seat reservations. \r\n \r\nYour earlier train is outside of peak travel period and so no time restriction or reservation is required. The 05:30 time is recommended because it will be the service that makes best connection with the 07:10. You could probably catch an earlier one if it exists and you are in time.          \nThey only print the main train time you will be using, mainly due to room on the ticket (assuming a credit card sized ticket) and restricted use. If you have a seat reservation and/or an advanced ticket, you should also get the seat reservation details and train time details for all the trains on a separate printed "ticket" sized piece of paper. You would be advised to take all the tickets/other pieces of paper with you that you were given in order to avoid any problems and only use the trains specified.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I frequently travel between London Liverpool Street station and Norwich station, I have tickets booked for this saturday for 5:30am, there is an interchange at Ipswich Station where I transfer to a 7:10am train. \r\n \r\nOne ticket says 7:10am on it, but none of them say 5:30am, I'm a little confused why - I've used this rail services many times and I'm just curious why this doesn't have the time printed on it, as it seems a vital thing the ticket inspector looks for. Is this just because of the interchange or have I am I missing a ticket for the 5:30am train?  ",

	{'answer': u'\nBecause no one can make them. They grabbed Hong Kong with ease due to military supremacy.          \n? Tibet has always been a part of China. China has supported them, paid money for their expenses, etc etc they were always considered Chinese people. People from Tibet wander into mainland China all the time.  \nI don\'t understand what you mean by give them back? \n \n& to above person... they didn\'t grab Hong Kong lol wtf? They can\'t grab something that was already theirs to begin with for like hundreds of years          \nIt\'s just like when you ask why US doesn\'t want to give New Mexico back to Mexico. Being treated by Japan does not relate to this at all. China has its interest in Tibet. \nForgot to mention, Europeans stole the entire America from natives, why won\'t they give it back and move back to Europe?          \nGive Tibet back .... to who? \n \nI mean as nice and idealized as it sounds to "give Tibet back to the Tibetans" they don\'t have a government that can take over and run things. Now it would be an improvement if China would give the region more autonomy, stop forcing it\'s people to move to places they don\'t want to move to, and generally commercializing the Tibetan culture, but tbh it\'s nothing worse than what the United States did to their own indigenous population. \n \nChina\'s just going to keep dealing with it China\'s way, and when they see other countries pointing fingers they\'re just going to call them hypocrites.          \nThe Emporer of China has several jobs to do and most emperors or leaders of China for the large 2000 years have done these. \n \nThey include, uniting the language (a 2000 year process that is still continuing), repair and extend the Great Wall (Even Chairman Mao did this, even if just for the tourists) and unit the country. \n \nThe leaders of China must work tirelessly to obtain and their territory.

	{'answer': u"\nBose speakers , Onkyo power system. if money is tight get the bose speakers and then upgrade the amplifier when you can          \nSomething like this is small and quite powerful. They plug straight into the headphone jack on the TV.  \r\n \r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-X-540-Multimedia-Speaker-System/dp/B000LBHFMO/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1292247907&sr=8-5 \r\n \r\nIf you're looking for something more expensive and powerful have a look at this. \r\n \r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Harman-Kardon-HKTS-7BQ-Cinema-Speaker/dp/B000R923X6/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1292248163&sr=1-8          \nAmazon has a good selection, take a look at Energy, Polk Audio, for good sound at a reasonable price, also Yamaha has some bargain speakers available. also Fluance has a home theater set up that they offer for $199 shipped direct.          \nYour TV might not be able to power external speakers by itself at all much less surround.  You will need to check to see if it has a built in amplifier for external speakers.  Most likely it doesn't.   \r\n \r\nYou didn't mention a budget so I'll just assume it's low.  What you need is an AVR (Receiver) plus speakers.  For higher end receivers I would normally suggest Denon or now days possibly the new Anthem receivers.  For the lower end however, perhaps around $350 I would suggest HK.  I picked up an HK at Frys awhile back for a friend for even less than that and it was quite decent for the money.  Speakers are a little harder to recommend and for small money it's really difficult to find anything that sounds even remotely decent.  This entry level system from Aperion should work well for you however...    It will certainly be a lot better than the TV speakers and a lot better than some of the cheap garbage I frequently see being recommended here on Yahoo.  Some of that cheap stuff will actually sound worse than the TV.  It may sound bigger than the TV and have more bass etc but the frequency response will be so screwed up it will be annoying to listen to.  I know I personally would end up throwing it out the window and just using the TV speakers.  I think a little HK receiver and the Aperion speaker package will probably sound really nice for you. \r\n \r\nmk          \nIf you are looking for good speakers, then never buy Bose, as the first respondent said.  The only thing good about Bose is there are none in my house.  You can buy cheap Radioshack speakers that sound better. \r\n \r\nThat being said, you really need to give a budget to work with here.  That will dictate the speaker quality you can get.  Here are some options under $500. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nYou also need to realize that with any of these speakers, you will need an amplifier (receiver).  Here are some decent entry-level receivers. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIf this is more than your budget, I would recommend shooting for a sound bar like this one. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd keep in mind, with a sound bar, you will not need a receiver.  They have built-in amplifiers.          \nBuying online is not the best thing to do with speakers.  The reason is that you can't listen to them before you buy them.   Listening to speakers is very important because not everyone will agree on what a good sounding speaker is.  You may also find that a fairly inexpensive speaker that sounds crappy to someone else sounds good to  you and is adequate for your needs.   \r\n \r\n I see a few folks recommending Bose.  I would not recommend them simply because they are not a good value for the money spent.   For what you spend on Bose you can get a much better speaker.          \nToday's tv only have an optical audio output which you have to connect to a home theater in a box or a receiver. Those home theater in a box are not very dependable and are not flexible in adding or upgrading. I would recommend looking at an Onkyo HT-S models, it is a separate receiver and a set of speakers (5.1 to 7.1), it is good when you are in a budget. Add a Panasonic blu ray disc player model BD-85 and you will have a pretty good system for around $600. You can demo the system at a Fry's Electronic store with your own ears, make sure you bring your own source of music for the demo. Hope this will help you out.          ",

	{'answer': u"\nYes, HK island + the Kowloon Peninsular supposed ceded to the British forever, what should be returned just the New Territories + north of Boundary Street in Kowloon. I'm sure no CCP mouthpieces working on here are aware of the fact. Margaret Thatcher & whoever policy makers at the time made a very wrong decision on HK and the 1 country 2 systems which have since proven useless in blocking off tons of corrupted, greedy, orderless, spitting, poor Mainlanders from marching into and abusing the city. \n \nWar is not viable, no Hongkongers nor the Brits would want a war but Britain and the West should put more pressure on the corrupted mafia regime to leave HK alone under the 2 systems so that Hongkongers able to decide who should be the 2017 Chief Executive and not another silly commie puppet dumping onto them.          \nYes, me neither wants to see a war. Just in theory that China wouldn&#x27;t be that terrible as some countries might have thought in terms of influence. \n \nBut, as what Ricky Wong, the President of the Hong Kong Television, has said, &quot;It is not the Hong Kong that I used to live.&quot;  The Communist will never allow Hongkongers to have a real referendum as democracy is the enemy of corrupted &#x2F; out school China.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    Apart from New Territories, the other parts of Hong Kong has been ceded to the UK already back in the 19th century. \n \nIt doesn't matter a war to get Hong Kong back as the Hongkongers are now already living in a hell because of the ruling of the Communist China. \n \nDavid, you should save us. Don't affair pissing China off.  I don't think China can win at the end if war did start.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nIt means 42.          \njust a number.          \nTwelve is a composite number, the smallest number with exactly six divisors, its proper divisors being 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Twelve is also a highly composite number, the next one being 24. It is the first composite number of the form p2q; a square prime, and also the first member of the (p2) family in this form. 12 has an aliquot sum of 16 (133% in abundance). Accordingly, 12 is the first abundant number (in fact a superabundant number) and demonstrates an 8 member aliquot sequence; {12,16,15,9,4,3,1,0} 12 is the 3rd composite number in the 3-aliquot tree. The only number which has 12 as its aliquot sum is the square 121. Only 2 other square primes are abundant (18 and 20). \r\n \r\nIf an odd perfect number is of the form 12k + 1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.          \nOh no... 6 is the middle of 12!! We\'re all going to die!!!          \nidk but 2012 is not the end of the world          \nNo, only the numbers 4,8,15,16,23 and 42 mean something          \nIt means one more than 11, nothing more \r\n \r\nespecially since a day is actually 3 minutes less than 24 hours, making the middle of the day 11 something.          \nYes. As far as time goes, it means your location is a certain amount of distant from the sun. As far as the end of the world...that\'s just a Mayan belief that is a victim of a massive snowball effect.          \nThere were 12 Disciples of Christ just like there are 12 eggs in a carton. \r\n \r\nOne of them was the rotten egg and he was called Judas.          \nit means governmental perfection in Biblical numerics          \nSadly, you can take any Number and make a mystery of it. \r\n \r\nLike.. \r\n \r\n11, everyone has made a mystery of 11 because of the 11:11 phenomenon which is nothing more than coincidence. \r\n \r\nThe same with 4:44, 5:55 and even the famous 666 and 999. \r\n \r\nIt\'s nothing, just a Number.          \nIt is just a number.  \r\n \r\nHowever, if you are asking about "Biblical numerology" : \r\n \r\nBiblical numerology is the study of numbers in the Bible. Two of the most commonly repeated numbers in the Bible are 7 and 40. The number 7 signifies completion or perfection (Genesis 7:2-4; Revelation 1:20). It is often called \u201cGod\u2019s number\u201d since He is the only One who is perfect and complete (Revelation 4:5; 5:1, 5-6). The number 3 is also thought to be the number of divine perfection: The Trinity consists of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. \r\n \r\nThe number 40 is often understood as the \u201cnumber of probation or trial.\u201d For example: the Israelites wandered for 40 years (Deuteronomy 8:2-5); Moses was on the mount for 40 days (Exodus 24:18); 40 days were involved in the story of Jonah and Nineveh (Jonah 3:4); Jesus was tempted for 40 days (Matthew 4:2); there were 40 days between Jesus\u2019 resurrection and ascension (Acts 1:3). Another number repeated in the Bible is 4, which is the number of creation: North, South, East, West; four seasons. The number 6 is thought to be the number of man: Man was created on the 6th day; man labors 6 days only. Another example of the Bible using a number to signify something is the number 666, the number of the Antichrist in Revelation chapter 13. \r\n \r\nWhether or not the numbers really do have a significance is still debated in many circles. The Bible definitely seems to use numbers in patterns or to teach a spiritual truth. However, many people put too much significance on \u201cBiblical numerology,\u201d trying to find a special meaning behind every number in the Bible. Often a number in the Bible is simply a number. God does not call us to search for secret meanings, hidden messages, and codes in the Bible. There is more than enough truth in the words and meanings of Scripture to meet all our needs and make us \u201ccomplete and thoroughly equipped for every good work\u201d (2 Timothy 3:16).          \nThe spiritual significance of twelve denotes Governmental perfection. It is the number or factor of all numbers connected with government: whether by Tribes or Apostles, or in measurements of time, or in things which have to do with government in the heavens and the earth.          \ndude you are so wasting my time.....          \nit means 1 dozen          \nIn a Biblical sense it\'s represents that which is full and complete in an organizational setting. The Holy Bible refers to the "12 tribes Of Israel". Jesus Christ had "12 apostles". In the book of Revelation chapter 7, the 144,000 chosen ones are sealed from each tribe of  Israel 12,000 apiece. Revelation chapter 12:1 mentions God\'s "woman" in heaven who has a crown of \'12 stars\' on her head. Revelation chapter 21 mentions heavenly Jerusalem as having 12 gates with an angel at each gate; 12 angels. The wall of the city had 12 foundation stones with the names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb. So these organizations whether on earth or in heaven are fully organized and complete.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Okay a few weeks ago I was thinking that 12 is the middle of everything like: \r\n-midnight (12): midnight is the middle of night and day \r\n-noon (12): is between morning, and evening \r\n-2012 (12): the end of the world.  \r\n \r\nI'm just asking if the number 12 means anything? or is it just a number?

(Rev. 21:12)          \n12 is the lowest number which can be halved, quartered, and thirded.          \n12 is significant because that is the number of disciples that Jesus had. it is also a multiple of the number 3 which is refrenced multiple times in the Bible, including the 3 days that Jesus was in the tomb before rising again, the number of wise men that came to visit, the number of times Peter denied Jesus in the crowd, and Jesus himself was on eart for 33 years, yet another multiple of 3!          \nGovernment and/or Divine Election \r\n \r\nIf you want a list that took me 5 years to compile, go here... \r\n          \nThe number twelve represents something that is divinely appointed by God.  There were 12 apostles, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 hours in a day and a night.  12 months.  Like yesterday I heard a man say He was born in the twelfth month at 12:12 am.  12 represents things which were ordained before the created of the world.          \nclick link and read -           \nIt means govermental perfection.

Guess it really is better to GET TO THE POINT          \nDude I'm sorry but you need to dump her or something you need trust for a relationship to work (common sense) and if she has broken it that many times and shows no sign of wanting to mature then you need to move on and  let her do her own thing..          \na problematic girlfriend u got there. \r\nif u don't love her anymore just break up because she keeps toying with u \r\nif u do  then  what does your heart tells u to do?          \nSorry to be the bearer of bad news but you shouldn't trust her. Honestly I would've kicked her to the curb the first time she cheated. You have every right to be concerned. I know you still have feelings for her but if she is going to keep doing this she isn't worth it. Many months of heartache and probably more to come; and she even gets mad at you for being suspicious. She doesn't take you to the movies (which she seems very excited about), and instead takes some random guy she's known for a week. It's not just friendship here, sorry. \r\n \r\n \r\nLet her go.          \nWell, from what you have posted it seems to me like she is just using you, If she would rather spend the night with some guy she has only known for a couple weeks then the guy she has dated for eleven months then there is something seriously wrong with your relationship. I say leave her, She doesn't seem to show any signs of stopping her bad habit of cheating on you and from what I have read it also appears she really doesn't care about you at all. Looks like your relationship is in shambles, best to just end it and find someone who won't take advantage of you.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Okay well basically my question is, Should I trust my girlfriend to go to a movie with another guy. I know most of yall are saying "Yes you should trust her, with out trust there is no relationship." But the reason why I question whether I should trust her or not is because she has cheated on me in the past. We have been dating for almost 11 months. But 1 day after our 4month anniversary I trusted her to go to the movies with her girlfriend and 2 other guys. I asked her if anything happen and she tells me this whole story of how the guy was hitting on her ( trying to hold her hand and asking to kiss her) and she kept denying him. I believed her but then herfriend called me and told me that my girlfriend was hugged up with the other guy holding his hand and kissing him. I question her about it and she denied it. After another hour of questioning she tells me the truth and I forgive her. 3 days later she is at her sisters house and she tells me her ex is coming over. Instinctively I ask why and she replies "My sister invited him"I told her how I felt about him coming over and she promised she wouldn\'t do anything. I believed her once again, she also told me she would text and call me to comfort me. So a hour passes after he gets there and no text. So i text her, no reply and I call her no answer. After 5 hours she calls me with the lame excuse saying she lost phone in the couch and I knew she was lying because her girlfriend told me that she was texting her. So i question her and she denies doing anything. Then her girlfriend tells me that they were cuddeling watching a movie on the couch and kissing. I question my girl about it and she denied for 4 days then admited. I havent trusted her since then, what she did to me after our 4month anniversary was heartless. So here we are present day doing pretty good and she hasnt cheated on me as far as I know because she stopped hanging with her girlfriend that told me everything. I have forgiven her for the past but havent forgot. She has been talking to this guy lately on facebook and he is flirting with her. I ask her who he is and she says just this guy she talked to in art class and she didnt really know him. A week later the messages continue so I ask what the deal is with this dude and shes says " He was like my bestfriend and we are very close" I reply "a week ago you said you didnt know him and he was just a guy from art class." I also mention that ive known her for 3 years and she never talked about this guy ever! (her supposed bestfriend). So earlier this week she makes a event on facebook called "Movie night" She invited 6 of her girlfriends and this one guy to the movies and not me. I question her about it and she says its just a friend thing and im like okay but i dont feel comfortable with him there.She gets all mad at me for not trusting around him and can you blame me? Today I over heard talking on the phone saying how she was going to the movies.. and all the girls she invited are not going besides one of them and this guy is coming and he is bringing a friend. I confront her about it and tell her I dont feel comfortable with her just going with one of her girlfriends and 2 other guys again. She gets mad at me and tells me that I have no trust in her and that im basically insecure. But I tell her that she made me this way but she still insist on  going to the movies. Its like going to the movies with this guy is more important to her than our relationship. I havent got  any sleep tonight because im scared of being hurt again. So my question is should I just chill and let her go because im being over worried. Or do I have a good reason to be concerned and do what ever I can to stop her from going? Idk im just desperate for help I just feel like she is attracted to this guy and he is trying to play the nice guy that listens to her  and gives her compliments. But I also listen to her when ever she needs to talk and I give her compliments constantly even though she doesnt accept them.(She always says its my job to say that or she always talks bad about her self, saying how my compliment is untrue) but when he compliments her shes all like "ty :)" or "awww (then compliments him)". Plzzz help me and thank you for reading.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nMake sure the tweeters are working - put your ear right up to each one and listen for the high frequency sounds.  If they are working, then these probably are not the speakers for you.  If they are not working, you need to get them repaired or return them. \n \nI bought a pair of Mission floorstanding speakers years ago and I had the same experience.  I returned them right away and bought a pair of JBL 4312 studio monitors which were fantastic.          \nIt could be that they need repair... but before coming to that conclusion they need to be set up properly in order to verify that....they should be placed at least two feet from any wall or flat reflective surface except the floor..also your seating position and the speakers should form an equilateral triangle where all sides and angles of the triangle are equal....the amplifier you use should be at least 40 watts RMS a channel with less than .09% distortion..also the material your playing should be CD quality or better....good speakers can bring out flaws in other areas of your equipment so you may be hearing that also check the connections and speaker wire...use a good speaker wire at least 18 gauge preferable 16 gauge or better....make sure the length of the wire is kept to the minimum needed and that the length is the same for both speakers....some times good speakers will sound kind of blah at first...due to the fact that there are so neutral...sometimes poor quality speakers will have a hot hi end and bolted bass and this will sound exciting at first but over time will cause fatigue while a good quality speaker will last and last and you never get tired of listening to good quality music through it.....          \nA common problem is having them out of phase.  \n \nMake sure that the cables/connectors match i.e + to +, - to - aka red to red and black to black. \n \nIt\'s unusual for Mission to be considered flat they are generally quite a lively speaker. \n \nOf course you do need a good amp and content source to drive a big pair of speakers like this.          \nThe Mission 753\'s are still excellent speakers, even though they will now be at least a decade old.  Unless they are the Freedom version, you shouldn\'t have paid more than \xa3200-\xa3250 for them.  Possible causes of your problem include: \n \nAmplifier - the 753\'s sound their best with a decent bit of power behind them.  If you\'ve got a cheap or low-powered amp, you\'ll never hear the speakers at their best. \nCables - despite some people\'s drivel, cables do actually make a difference.  If you\'ve got the speakers connected to your amp with bell wire, you\'re strangling their sound. \nTweeter - many owners upgraded the tweeter in the 753, to get an even clearer sound.  Some "upgrades" were nothing of the sort.  Check to see if your speakers have the original Mission tweeters.          \nThose have bi-wire capability - make sure the bridge strap is installed between the bass connections and the upper connection pair. You may just be playing the woofers.  \n \nI\'ve never heard a Mission speaker I didn\'t like - love the brand! For a pair to not be wonderful, something is definitely wrong and a connection issue could be it.          ',

Yes, I\'m old enough to make decisions for myself, but I don\'t feel completely prepared to go out in the real world. I think that\'s what college is for -- a transition to adulthood. \r\n12. It\'s pretty big. \r\n13. ? \r\n14. I reread The Great Gatsby before I saw the movie. Before that, The Other Boleyn Girl. \r\n15. Every other day, but I wash my face twice a day, and I only wash my hair twice a week, which is actually a lot healthier for it. \r\n16. 18 \r\n17. Yes. Not too much -- just some BB cream, a little concealer if I need it, a loose, translucent mineral powder, a little bit of natural-colored eyeshadow, and some mascara. If I\'m going somewhere important I\'ll put on a little foundation and some eyeliner as well.  \r\n18. 18.0 \r\n19. I can be, I suppose, but I\'m not. My parents taught me and my siblings to always act like the ladies and gentlemen that we are, so if I ever am nasty it\'s not in public.  \r\n20. I graduate from high school next week as salutatorian of my class. I will be attending Columbia University in the fall as a part of Columbia College, the university\'s liberal arts school.          \n1)No,I\'m dead plain looking \r\n2)Yes,if I need to shite or piss I do it in the school,the toilets aren\'t that bad \r\n3)From my friend telling me that she\'ll be at our meeting point to walk to school at 25 to 9. \r\n4)Dont know and bbm is shite.  \r\n5)November 1st \r\n6)100% complete teachers pet \r\n7)6 hour min 3 days a week,5 hours 2 days a week \r\n8)not much \r\n9)My mum absolutely,my dad not so much \r\n10)Tuesday in Geography for talking  \r\n11)What? \r\n12)Small but my new room will be bigger as its getting done up \r\n13)what! \r\n14)Glitter by Kate Maryon \r\n15)4 times a week \r\n16)Not saying \r\n17)Not often,I\'d rather sleep in than put makeup on for school \r\n18)Very low \r\n19)Yep,I can be a b****. \r\n20) I\'m in Year 8          \n1. uh, no \r\n2. yeah they have been upgraded! \r\n3.

	{'answer': u'\nEnsure that the station concerned supports fast ticket selling. The Network I work on does not and most people that get internet sold tickets get very upset when we tell them that they have to wait for them by snail mail or pay to travel outside of our area to collect their tickets. \r\n \r\nI would suggest you contact the selling agent and see what the administration costs are to transfer the ticket required to be picked up from another station. \r\n \r\nGood Luck          \nIt should be fine. I booked some tickets to be collected from the Fasticket machine at BRIGHTON,  went to Doncaster for some other tickets, and collected the ones that should have been at Brighton as well! \r\nYou will need the reference number and the same credit card with which you booked the tickets online.  \r\nIf you have a problem, the ticket office shold be able to sort it out for you.  \r\nGood luck.

	 'question': u"\n    When booking a train ticket online, I had to state which station I wanted to collect it from (using a FastTicket machine). Since making the booking my travel plans have changed and I now need to collect it from a different station. \r\n \r\nHave you ever had to do this? \r\n \r\nThe website I booked the ticket with claims that this is possible, but I'd be grateful if anyone out there who's had to do this could confirm that there are no problems collecting the ticket from a FastTicket machine at a different station to the one you'd originally said you wanted to collect it from... Don't want to end up without the ticket. \r\n \r\nThanks in advance for your help.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nI say you\'re over reacting. Many of my guy friends put their arms around me, but it\'s in a friendly manner. I wouldn\'t think too much into it. Yes you should trust your girlfriend.  \r\n \r\nGood Luck          \nIt\'s not okay for your friends to touch your girlfriend. She\'s YOUR girlfriend for a reason. But I mean, you can\'t change the past, all you can do now is talk to both of them and make sure it doesn\'t happen again.          \nI say that your friend probably likes your gf and is jealous of yall. But that would have made me extremely mad too.          \nwow she\'s probably cheating on u with your friend but u should talk to her first before deciding on anything she might not be cheating on you there\'s a 50/50 chance [just talk to her]          \nYour gf maybe didnt want to tell u what he did because she was probably confused as well as u were. But if that was the first time they met and he is so comfortable touching her that way, than u should definitely keep your eyes and ears open for any other suspicious acts. There isnt enough "evidence" for you to not trust her yet, just be extra causious on how they act around eachother. Just remember to always follow your gut feeling, if u smell something fishy, keep sniffing! I followed mine and found my bf was talking to other girls.          \nyeah i think you r just over reacting shes your gf you should trust her          \nShe definately liked what yoru friend did. They were flirting..          \nNo i fuc*ed her last nite          \nI wouldn\'t worry about your girlfriend, it\'s your friend you need to worry about. \r\n \r\none of the major rules of friendship is No Stealing...as in clothes, music, possessions and significant others. in other words, hands off. he crossed the line by touching her in such an intimate way and the only reason she didn\'t tell you at first was because she didn\'t want to make a huge deal out of it and start a fight between you two, not because she had something to hide. she was trying to be a good girlfriend, and you\'re overanalyzing the whole not waiting for you thing when the bigger picture is the fact his hands were all over your girl.          \nwell man if it seems to me like she is not very loyal in "your" eyes \r\nand maybe this situation is not something to stress over to much  \r\nbut maybe you should watch a little bit to see what other things she does with other guys..see if she is trustworthy and if she is not..forget your feelings and dump her          \nyou have a total right to be upset. you should observe what else happens between..or between her and other guys for that matter. and your friend is a dick.          \nYour very jealous dude. dont take offense to me but you wrote a long concerned question over a common thing that happens. when you are not around her i am sure she flirts with other guys too. 99% of women flirt with other guys at work, the store, the mechanic. you got to trust her. if you dont then you become posessive and you become a real drag and a turn off to women. remember, if your a good catch you have nothing to worry about. you must let the bird fly free and not cage it. if it wants to come back it will. if it dont then it dont.          \nYOUR "FRIEND" IS AN ASSHOLE. I\'m sorry, but he seems the type to try and "win" other guy\'s girlfriends at the first meeting. OF COURSE you trust your girlfriend, she was trying to be nice and not make a scene and this buster put his hands on her and pressured her into going in the club w/o you. He was trying to make you feel small, because he needed to feel big. Sorry, this guy is JERK, don\'t take him around your gf again, ok?          \ni think that girlfriends should tell their bf about things like that. yeah maybe there\'s things i haven\'t told my bf because im scared. maybe she was afraid to tell you that he had touched her like that. yes you are right. we should wait for our bf and the bf should wait for the gf. its a sharing thing. i think that if you really love her then you should trust her and even if she doesn\'t tell you everything still be there and try to talk to her and let her know that she can talk to you. i think that your friend crossed the line but talk to him and try to see the better things of the whole thing. it will all work out in the end.          \ntell your friend to keep his hands off your girl! i wouldn\'t go out with both of them at the same time again.  \r\n \r\ngirlfriends should wait for there boyfriends! you are correct!          \nfirst of all if your friend respects you, he would never put his hand on your girl no matter what. at least not in that way.  \r\n \r\nyou should question you friend to see what he says. \r\nno matter what your gf is to blame too. if she didnt like the way he was touching her she would have moved away from him          \ndude your gut is usually right. maybe her intentions weren\'t bad, you should probably give her the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that she let this dude she hardly knows touch her like that and the fact that she let him dictate what she does knowing you are there should tell you something. she\'s weak man don\'t put up with that. talk to your friend about it too. he should agree with you and apologize if he wants to keep it real, if he tries arguing and defending himself...well you can do the math brotha          \nInsecure about yourself and your girlfriend. Take it easy. He might have touched her once but you have her all the time... Be worried if she grabbed on him and denied everything...          \nHonestly, that is not right what your friend did! And further more, if i was the g/f, I would have told him to get his hands off of me! I would have told my b/f ASAP!! I mean, what is she doing not being by your side? I don\'t think you\'re over reacting at all! And if it were me, I would start thinking, "When she goes out w/o me, do other guys touch her? Is she used to this?" Talk to her about it and see what she thinks. Maybe she doesn\'t know how to act around a b/f in a club setting? (trying to view both sides). But seriously, sit her down and talk to her about how you felt that night. If she doesn\'t see that she hurt you, then you need to reconsider your relationship (not meaning break up with her immediately, but just see how she acts for a while). If she can\'t respect your feelings then maybe she is not the girl for you. Also, talk to your guy friend and let him know how he hurt you. I\'m sorry that you had a bad night...I hope this helps!! Good Luck!! :)          ',
	 'question': u"\n    So we were all at the front entrance of the club. \r\nMy girlfriend and my friend got pass security first. \r\nWhile i was going through security I notice my friend had his hands on my girlfriends lower back and hips. \r\nI was angry. \r\nThey both walk into the club together and my girlfriend didnot even wait for me. \r\nI later walk in confused...since shouldn't the girlfriend wait for her boyfriend? \r\n \r\nAfter my gf and I left the club, I asked her if my friend touched her. \r\nShe said he did and showed me how he did it. I was like WOW \r\n \r\nThan I also thought wait...if i did not bring this up to her she wouldnt have told me about my friend touching her.. \r\nshe said she moved away from him. and didnt want to make it a big deal like a fight btw my friend..but still a gf should tell her bf about these things right? \r\n \r\nThe funny thing is they are not close at her cus that was the first time I introduce my friend to my girlfriend. \r\n \r\n...Should i trust my friend and/or girlfriend? \r\n \r\nIs it ok for my friend to touch her? He said he was guiding her into the club and thats what gentlemens do.... \r\n \r\nBUT? do gentlemens guide their freind's gf into the club right in front of them??? \r\n \r\nShouldnt I be doing that? sigh I dont want to be protective but at that moment my stomach Hurted and I had a gut feeling what he did was wrong....I was really hurt....picture yourself outside and you see your girlfriend and friend walking inside w.out you than later you walk sigh \r\n \r\nmy girlfriend said she waited but she said my friend said dont worry lets just go inside....and she did....:( Dont gfs wait for the bf? \r\n \r\nShe told me at the time she didnt think it was a big deal, but now realize it was?

	{'answer': u'\nnot sure but good luck!          \ncheck out packages on travelocity or other websites like it. Try booking now to save money.          \nI have been to Disney World 3 times, and we always get this package for four. But the cheapest hotels are the "All Star Resorts". There are Sports, Music, Movies, and a few more. They are really nice, and the cheapest resorts in Disney          \ndays inn          \nAAA auto club has great deals for its members.          \n6 is too many people drop the children and just get drunk on Disney pleasure island          \nhey well first of are you going to just orlando or disney. because if you are going to disney the website does and tells everything for you and if you stay in disney world you have transportation set up for you at all times. I think disney would be the best choice because they have packages but if you are staying just in Orlando i think you should check out there condos since there is so many of you.          \nNOTHING is cheap at Disney at christmas time!!!  In fact its the highest priced season.          \nTry travel sites such as travelosity or hotels.com. Also if you are a frequent traveler, use points you have to stay at a hotel for free. There are also hotels that allow you to stay in the park. Also book in advance! Have fun!          \nVillas are cheaper, this website ((below)) is one of the cheapest places to buy in Orlando \r\n \r\n \r\nyou can tell that this is a good deal if you compare it to this: \r\n \r\n \r\n*********GOOD LUCK!!!!****************          \nHere! \r\ngo to yahoo travel! \r\nhttp://travel.yahoo.com/ \r\nClick on hotels then cars! then you get what u want hope this helps          \nLook at this website - you get a full package and its good value: \r\n \r\nwww.travelcitydirect.com \r\n \r\nHave been with them before and they give great service          \nBooked online for my honeymoon.  It was intended to be very romantic.  Discovery was her favorite space shuttle and it was supposed to launch that week.  Unfortunately, Columbia, may her crew have peace, broke apart a few months earlier, so we did not get to watch the launch as planned.  Still, Kennedy Space Center is worth a good day, maybe two if you\'re into the space program or science in general.   \r\n \r\nRental cars...  Hidden costs are usually the taxes, which are often ridiculous.  If you have good insurance, no big worries.  If not, take the extra insurance they offer.  It\'s expensive, but an accident can set you back a good bit more.   \r\n \r\nDisney is great.  We surprised ourselves by spending the most time at Epcot.  Not for the attractions, so much, as the food.  The German place, specifically.  Every day, whatever park we were at, we grabbed the monorail back to Epcot for dinner.   \r\n \r\nDon\'t go between May and September.  Besides the herds of vacationers, it\'s gawdawful hot and humid.  If that\'s when you have to go, it\'s still worth the trip, but get lots of sunscreen and a wide brimmed hat, water bottle, you know, survival gear ;-).   \r\n \r\nWe stayed outside the park, because we went to Universal and KSC, but if we were going to do it again, I think we\'d probably have picked one of the park\'s resorts.  It\'s not that big of a savings; $15 a day was about the difference for comparable facilities at the time.   \r\n \r\nBTW, if you\'re interested mostly in rides, spend your days at Universal.  The park is smaller, the rides are closer to each other, there\'s usually more shade, and it\'s just more fun that way.   \r\n \r\nAlso, get your speed passes, whatever they are called.  Not standing in line for hours is much more fun than the alternative.   \r\n \r\nOutside of the parks, we ate everywhere from Medieval Tymes, not sure on the spelling, to Wal-Mart.  I think I-Hop had the most consistent food.  Anyway, we never spent more than $25 on dinner, except when it came with a show... or drinks.   \r\n \r\nThe big parks are of course the major part of the days, but you know, we found a great place for mini-golf, an alligator farm (interesting at feeding time), an upside down house and souvenir\'s up the wazoo.   \r\n \r\nI\'m not a big drinker, but there\'s a whole lotta night life there, too.  If you want the most wholesome night spots, there\'s Downtown Disney.  Toss back a pint with Hook.   \r\n \r\nOrlando is a great place to spend a few days, or even a couple weeks.  Bring lots of cash, and an emergency credit card, \'cause chances are, the cash will run out before you run out of things to spend it on, and if you don\'t have any money for the trip home, you may end up working at one of those souvenir shops.   \r\n \r\nAnyway, I do run on, so I\'m going to shut up now.  Have a great trip!          \ntry travel city direct          \nFirst, don\'t go Christmas week if you can avoid it--it is the second busiest week of the year, followed by New Years week.  See this for the weeks of 2009 at Disney World ranked in order:  \r\n \r\nSecond, be aware that kids under three don\'t count against room capacity limits--which are absolute--and that more than 2 adults incur an extra charge--which I believe is $10 a night. \r\n \r\nThird, your group, if it is truly 6, will not fit into many Disney World resort rooms.  Your best cheap option for 6 is the suites at All-Star Music, which sleep 6--2 in one room with a king bed, and 4 on convertible furniture in a living room.  See this for large families at Walt Disney World:  \r\n \r\nFinally--back to the Xmas week point--that is also the most expensive time of the year, depending on the hotel up to 50% more per night than the weeks just prior.  See this for price seasons at Disney WOrld:  \r\n \r\nHope this helps--if you can, arrive December 5 or 12 instead! Dave          \nchristmas time is an amazing time to go.  \r\nthere\'s tons of decorations and lights.  \r\nand it evne "snows" at night.  \r\ni usually use AAA.  \r\nyou could go to the disney website and customize your trip and book it online or print it out take  it to AAA and see if they can get you a better price.  \r\n \r\n \r\ni personally love disney\'s pop century hotel. its one of their value hotels. and costs $82 per night.  \r\nall age groups will love this hotel but its got some really cool stuff for kids to walk around and see. (well kids and kids at heart alike actually) \r\nand i\'d get the disney dining plan if i was you. you can only get it if you stay at a disney hotel though.  \r\n \r\nalso are you flying? \r\nare you just planning to go to disney and maybe sea world and universal studios and islands of adventure? \r\nif so there is no need for a car.  \r\nas long as you stay at a disney hotel.  \r\ndisney will pick you up at the airport for free and bring you back for free via magical express buses.  \r\nand there are also buses at the hotel that take you fee of charge to the disney parks, water parks, and downtown disney.  \r\nthere are also shuttles provided by sea world and universal studios to take you to those parks.          \nIf you plan on spending a lot of time at the Disney parks, it really pays to stay at a Disney hotel or resort.  Transportation is provided and there are other perks, that save you money.          \nWell, I have a pretty good site for your family to browse through. Friendly service and great value rental homes in the Orlando area.          \nI am going this holiday season as well. We are slated to arrive Dec. 17 and depart Dec. 27. Where are you coming from? Is it remotely near the D.C. area? \r\n \r\nIf it is, consider Amtrak\'s auto train. They have a train that departs Lorton, VA and travels (no stops) to about 30 miles north of Orlando. We are booked on it --- all 5 of us and a mini van for under $900 round trip! Amazing deal - and, we\'ll have a car while there to explore Universal, etc. \r\n \r\nWhere are you staying. Have you tried contacting hotels individually? I had a lot of success this way. Instead of buying a package, I\'ve contact individual hotels looking for bargains as you have too big a party to fit in a Budget Hotel. I got a nice, large room at a Moderate Hotel for a Budget Hotel price - simply by asking and being persistent. I\'m talking sending letters - the whole enchilada - it helps. \r\n \r\nAlso, we bought our MVMCP tickets now as they sell out fast. This will be our first Christmas there and we are extremely excited. I\'ve taken care of the Train transportation, got the MVMCP tickets, got the hotel, got a few meal reservations - now I just need tickets. \r\n \r\nGood luck. Let me know if you have any more questions. I\'ve been researching this subject extensively and have been in contact with people from  Disney, ABC, Hilton, D.T.D. restaurants and Swan and Dolphin. Reach out and make contacts and go from there.          \nI live in florida and have been to disney countless times. \r\nI suggest you stay in a disney resort.  \r\nIf you stay in a disney resort you can take a bus to the parks so you wouldnt have to rent a car. The bus will take you to all the parks and water parks and down town disney.  \r\nA nice hotel is Coronado Springs. It has a water slide a nice pool and nice rooms.  \r\nGood luck.  \r\nHave a nice trip! \r\nBTW you will be in line for quite a while to get on the rides...          ',

	 'question': u"\n    Earlier today I was out walking with my dog. I went the way we always go. I noticed there was one magpie in one field and in the field next to that there was two magpies close together. I ignored it and caried on walking. When I got to the end of that road, where the main road started I noticed there was a car and the people inside were staring at me. Because I felt uncomfortable with them watching me I decided to go up this little footpath in the trees. As I walked the magpies kept following me. So when I got to the end of that path the white car from the other end of the path was now at the end I had walked to! I totally started freaking out and ran back the way I had been before. When I got to that end again the car wasn't there so I carried on up past the fields. I couldn't see the magpies anymore so I just carried on walking. After a while two of them flew into the tree to the left of me and as I carried on walking they would fly to the trees closest to me. There was no longer a third one, just the two.  \nI don't know if I'm just being paranoid or whatever but could someone explain what is going on? Thanks.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nThey DON\'T "guard" EITHER!!!!!!!!!! \r\nRunning in circles,screaming hysterically & biting anything w/in reach is ***********FEAR******!!!! \r\n \r\n"Resource guarding" is FEAR & bad-manners. \r\n \r\nDogs can be & ARE trained to "guard" objects....see "ring sport"....TRAINED,not "possessive".          \nMost of the time when I see that question the person asking it has a dog that "protects" him from things he doesn\'t need protecting from....like family members or affection from significant others.  I think its obvious that is not protectiveness but possessiveness. \r\n \r\nPersonally, I don\'t hold to the idea that an untrained dog will NEVER protect his owner.  When I am working with a foster dog who is giving me grief I have to lock my dogs in the next room, because they will try to "help" me by attacking the dog. \r\n \r\nI also had a rough collie who on a couple of occasions defended us from what he perceived to be threats.   \r\n \r\nIMO the problem is that dogs dont know enough to judge when to protect and when not to, and an untrained dog who is protective is likely to read a situation wrongly and create a bigger problem.          \nI agree 100% with Kaper\'s answer.  I cannot add anything to it.  She is right on.  Excellent answer.          \nI think ms. manners hit the nail on the head. I also think this is a large gray area when it comes to dogs. \r\n \r\nI think dogs are possessive when they are \'protecting\' from things that clearly aren\'t threats. Then again, it could also be that the dog perceives a threat where we don\'t--or that the dog is merely protecting themselves while the humans stand by. \r\n \r\nI also think that dogs can absolutely protect their owners and/or family members. I had an Aussie cut off a bull that was charging at me when I was younger--I certainly viewed that as protection. Same dog also \'protected\' us from a dark object in the night once--she wouldn\'t let us near, and slowly and carefully worked out what it was. \r\n \r\nTurns out it was a grill cover that had blown over, but that\'s not the point :)          \nit\'s not true that only trained dogs are protective.It is true that certain dogs are more protective than others because when  they where originally bred they actually had certain jobs to do.the difference between protective and possessive is the the reason  the dog is doing it.Protecting the house, the owner is for the pack as a whole, their territoryand their pack mates. A pack member is only as strong as it\'s pack, whereas possessive behavior is for the survival of the individual animal (ex; the ham sandwich,a toy). They\'re ensuring  their own  survival. although it might sound strange because we\'re talking about PETS and people want to treat them like humans.dogs don\'t reason like humans they\'re animal  so it\'s important to remember when dealing with dogs, to think like a dog not like a person.protection trained dogs is a whole other subject because they\'re taking that naturally or bred protective nature and channeling it to a specific task.          \noOo I like this! Lol! \r\n \r\nFirstly, why people are still stuck on "Only when told" is beyond me. We run drills where the dog is not given a command and is expected to/taught to respond with his handler in trouble ie the dog exiting the back window of the patrol car should a fight between the handler and a suspect break out at a traffic stop etc. \r\n \r\nBut to answer the question, I don\'t see it as a dog guarding a resource. I see it as basic pack behavior. In a pack it\'s everyone\'s job to warn of danger. It doesn\'t mean they\'ll actually bite a flea, it just means that they will all alarm vocally and pester the "target" with the threat of violence (think...a bear who approaches a pack of wolves\' den with young fuzzy ones around). They\'re going to collectively make noise and nip. This is what your average every day dog is going to do. \r\n \r\nProtection is not the behavior I\'ve just described. The dog mentioned above, who\'s alarm barking, maybe even biting, will leave you when you need him most. When he is pushed past his defensive drive\'s threshold he will run. He simply does not have the confidence learned through dozens of man hours of bitework training to fight a man. He does not have the confidence in his experienced gained from training to feel comfortable in his ability to win a fight. Is a dog who\'s alarm barking protecting you? No, he\'s protecting himself, you are valuable to his survival, by warning you, and sticking close, he is looking out for his own interest so to speak...BUT if you can\'t capitalize on his "help" you\'re dead, he\'s not going to die for OR with you, he\'s going to run! \r\n \r\nThe typical dog barking at an intruder is the same as you defending a stranger who\'s being beaten up on a back street some where. Your natural instinct is to say "Hey! What\'s going on!? Cut that out!"...but if the bad guy pulls out a gun, and you don\'t have one, and he points it at you, and tells you to get lost? The average reasonable person is going to leave the person who desperately needs their help all alone and go call the cops without risking THEIR safety! Your average every day dog will do the same minus calling the cops! I do NOT call that "protection" although it is still indeed a valiant act in todays World where it\'s possible to get murdered in a street with a dozen witnesses and not have 1 person call 911 or come down to help. A protection trained dog would be akin to an armed off duty police officer...he\'s going to say "Hey! What\'s going on!? Cut that out!"...but when threatened with a firearm and told to leave now, and when seeing this other person is really getting beat on, he\'s going to pull his concealed carry weapon with a confidence he gained from practice with a sidearm and the accompanying experience that comes with being a police officer, to be able to eliminate threats and come out alive, and the victor. \r\n \r\nKaper might be scared to death if she has to draw down on somebody, but I assure you she\'s more comfortable with it than most of the people here...and if one had to pick somebody from Y!A to take along to a possible hostile situation one is going to pick an LEO like Kaper or somebody who\'s ex-military! Not one of the 15 year olds asking if they should take their dog to the vet if he\'s been hit by a car, caught on fire, and has bloody diarrhea all at the same time... \r\n  \r\nHope this helps clear it up.  :) \r\n \r\n-edit- Kaper I didn\'t even look to see who answered this Q I just used your name randomly. I love your answer, the "If the guy taking your purse hits you or pulls a knife" thing. Great analogy!          \nPossession guarding is a reaction.  It is a response - usually fear driven. \r\n \r\nProtection is a trained ACTION.  It has nothing to do with fear.          \nWell I can tell you my dogs would do much like most of the reasonable answers here mentioned. \r\n \r\nThey would alarm me, then maybe get possessive or whatever, then right before all hell broke loose, they would be hiding under the couches...lol \r\n \r\nI have Chihuahua\'s- what do you expect....unless it\'s a mouse with a knife, they don\'t stand a chance.  \r\n \r\nBUT I have seen everyday regular PETS that would risk it all for their owner....I had one such dog growing up....he is the ONLY dog I ever had who would have PROTECTED me no matter what, even if it meant his death. \r\n \r\nIn all seriousness, I personally wouldn\'t rely on any dog to protect me. I\'m a grown woman who can handle my business. If & only if, the attacker had a gun, would I comply & even then I would do so waiting for that opportunity to strike out & gain the upper hand. \r\n \r\nI also adore Kaper & Curtis\' answers.          \nok i have to disagree with one of your statements, any dog can protect, some dogs are raised to. Anyway, the difference between protectiveness and possessiveness is this; if the dog is protective, he will protect against a threat or what he believes is a threat. Possessiveness is when he wont let ANYTHING near you, threat or not. Hope this helps.          \nDogs can literally grow to become protective of their owners without having been trained to do so. My first guide dog is a prime example. She had a sense of people that some dogs possess & once when we were in a grocery store, one of their men who was working the meat counter kept coming around to me trying to get around my dog & giving me all sorts of compliments even after I asked him to back off b/c I wasn\'t interested in him & I was married. He didn\'t listen & became aggressive only when he went to grab my arm, my guide dog barked like mad & nearly took his arm off! IF my guide dog had actually bitten the man, there is a high probability she would have been put down on the guide dog school\'s say so without waiting for the county to make the call. They\'re not bred or trained to be aggressive or trained to be protective; it comes from working as a team but some dogs do have the ability to sense a person\'s intentions & if they are to hurt the handler, the dogs will protect their handler.  \n \nThere was a similar case in New York after a blind woman was mugged despite having a guide dog but what the thief didn\'t count on was the fact that the guide dog was much like mine & protective of his handler. By the time the mugger jumped at her, the dog had him down & chewed a good portion of his arms, legs, & even his neck area! There was a long drawn out series of meetings as to whether or not to put the guide dog down, which left the dog\'s handler in such grief she couldn\'t bear to even go to work, which is understandable b/c not only are these dogs an extension of our bodies, they are our best friends too. We can tell them anything & all we get in return is their love & it doesn\'t matter if we corrected them or spoke harshly if they did something they knew was wrong - they show unconditional love. I\'m sure my guide dog I have currently would act the same in protecting me & esp my youngest daughter b/c they spent the longest time together although my 1st dog was merely months older than she was when I came home with the guide dog. She\'d growl if anyone even looked at that child wrong! Often if I couldn\'t find her in her crib, then her toddler\'s bed, I always found her in this nice fluffy bed where my guide dog slept & they\'d be fast asleep w/my daughter\'s head on my guide\'s belly as a pillow & she\'d wrapped them both in her favorite blanket she dragged everywhere! But again, there were only 4mos between their ages so they basically grew up together too; I had to retire her early b/c she had such a heavy pull that it was ripping my rotator cuff to the point where I was going to require surgery if I didn\'t stop working her so I retired her & a sister-in-law & her husband took her in as their pet where she lived a long life & actually passed away several years ago. My current guide dog is already 13yrs old & I fear he doesn\'t have long left but I can\'t send him to retire with anyone; my heart just won\'t let it happen. He was almost scrapped from the program until it came down to 3 blind w/mobility disabilities who he would match well with & it turned out he matched best w/me. He\'s slower now than before but that\'s okay b/c I\'m slower too & my lumbar spine damage will have me wheelchair bound before much longer so I want as much time to spend with him as possible.  \n \nAs for the guide dog who attacked the mugger, the woman was allowed to keep him; he wasn\'t put down. The mugger on the other hand was charged with the mugging & he was charged with attacking a service animal, which allowed the judge to add more time on his sentencing for his crime!          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Throughout my time in the Y!A dog section, I\u2019ve seen at lot of well-informed, educated answers to the \u201cmy dog protects me\u201d statements on here.  The general response is that only a professionally bred and trained protection dog protects his owner, and only because he\u2019s been told to do so.  All other \u2018protective\u2019 behaviors among pet dogs are really possessiveness.  The dog sees the owner as a resource and is hoarding it from other dogs or possibly even people.   \r\n \r\nWhile I agree with that statement, what is really the difference between the owner\u2019s Old Yeller idea of protection, and the modern trainer\u2019s idea of possessiveness?  If the dog is being possessive, then isn\u2019t it in fact protecting that person from other dogs?  If I protect my ham sandwich from the grabby hands of my sneaky younger brother, I\u2019m being possessive, but aren\u2019t I also being protective of my sandwich?  Say instead I\u2019m defending my purse from a thief- I like my purse and the things in it, say even for sentimental value, so I\u2019m going to hang onto it.  Is that possessiveness or protection? \r\nThere might be a difference then in how the dog views itself in relation to the owner- a dominant dog feels it\u2019s his duty to protect something that\u2019s his, whereas a submissive dog won\u2019t.  However, I\u2019ve seen dogs who are appropriately submissive with humans get between their owner and an aggressive dog.   \r\n \r\nWhat\u2019s going on here, and how is possession guarding really different from \u2018protection?'

	{'answer': u'\nIdolatry.          \nThe Catholics put up with more hatred, from the likes of mike, who clearly has no idea what the word "idolatry" means.          \nThe protestants broke off from the catholics over issues like the pope as head of the church and therefore the only real priests are catholic who can administer the sacraments such as Holy Commion and confession          \nLess than the bigots like mike would have you believe.          \nThis site gives the most thorough explanation I\'ve found: \r\n \r\n          \nThe 95 Thesis posted by Martin Luther on the door of the Wittenberg Church          \nCatholics believe in: \r\n \r\n-Transubstantiation (The bread and wine actually *becoming* the body and blood of Christ) \r\n-Contraception being fundamentally wrong \r\n-No sex before marriage \r\n-Mary being the virgin mother of Christ and having been immaculately conceived (without sin) \r\n-Intercessory prayer via saints \r\n-8 Sacraments \r\n-A greater focus on tradition and ritual than strictly the word of the Bible \r\n-The Pope as the descendant of Peter and leader of the church \r\n \r\nProtestantism covers a wide range of churches which broke off from the Catholic Church during the Reformation, but the main differences are fewer sacraments, a greater focus on adhering  to the word of the Bible, not worshiping Mary or saints, leadership within churches, for example by elder members of the community, and in some cases, a more open-minded standpoint, eg. on gay or women priests.          \nprotestants have man made Laws and protest that the Catholic church is wrong; that is where you get your name.  The Catholic Church is the true church and founder of the Christian Faith, read this.  \u2014Ecclesiastical history is the scientific investigation and the methodical description of the temporal development of the Church considered as an institution founded by Jesus Christ and guided by the Holy Ghost for the salvation of mankind.  \r\n \r\nIn a general way the subject matter of history is everything that suffers change owing to its existence in time and space; more particularly, however, it is the genetical or natural development of facts, events, situations, that history contemplates. The principal subject of history is man, since the external changes in his life affect closely his intellectual interests. Objectively speaking, history is the genetical development of the human mind and of human life itself in its various aspects, as it comes before us in series of facts, whether these pertain to individuals, or to the whole human race, or to any of its various groups. Viewed subjectively, history is the apperception and description of this development, and, in the scientific sense, the comprehension of the same set forth in a methodical and systematic manner. The history of mankind may have as many divisions as human life has aspects or sides. Its noblest form is the history of religion, as it developed in the past among the different groups of the human race. Reason shows that there can be only one true religion, based on the true knowledge and the proper worship of the one God. Thanks to the light of revelation we know that this one true religion is the Christian religion, and, since there are different forms of the Christian religion, that the true religion is in particular the one known as Catholic, concrete and visible in the Catholic Church. The history of Christianity, therefore, or more properly the history of the Catholic Church, is the most important and edifying part of the history of religion. Furthermore, the history of religion is necessarily a history of religious associations, since the specifically human, that is, moral\u2014and therefore religious\u2014life, is necessarily social in character. Every religion, therefore, aims naturally at some form of social organization, Christianity all the more so, since it is the highest and most perfect religion. There are three stages in the formation of religious associations:  \r\n \r\n          \nThe Roman Catholic Church is a works based religion, where man must work and cooperate with God to merit salvation. \r\n \r\nThe RCC believes that the authority in the church is the Pope and the Magisterium or the votes of the various church councils along with the Bible.  They teach that they wrote the Bible which any historian will tell you is not true.  The Bible was written mainly by Jews with one or two possible exceptions. \r\n \r\nBible believing Christians, I really dislike the term "Protestant", believes that all the works necessary to earn Salvation were done by Jesus for us on the Cross. \r\n \r\nBible believing Christians believe the 66 books of the Bible contain the only authoritative teaching for the church. \r\n \r\nI have a 5 page Word document which I\'ll send to anyone who asks, which compares the differences between the Bible and what the Roman Catholic Catechism teaches.  This document is annotated with the paragraph numbers from the Catholic Catechism. \r\n \r\nIt\'s too large to copy and paste here or send by the Yahoo Answers E-mail system.  I\'ll need your regular E-mail address to send it. \r\n \r\nIn addition, here is a message, taught by John MacArthur, pastor of a large church in southern california whose congregation is composed mostly of former Roman Catholics. \r\n \r\nThis teaching comes in nine parts ranging from 6 to 9 minutes in each part: \r\n \r\nPart 1: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 2: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 3: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 4: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 5: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 6: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 7: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 8: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPart 9: \r\n \r\n \r\n          \nProtestants: \r\nsola scriptura: the word of the Lord is given in the bible and is complete. \r\n \r\nCatholic: \r\nThe bible is the word of the Lord along with the traditions of men (pope, bishops, priests) which contradicts the bible. \r\n--------------- \r\n \r\n \r\nColossians 2:8  See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.  \r\n          \nThe Roman Catholic Church was founded by Christ who gave the keys of the Kingdom (a symbolic reference to spiritual authority) to Peter. He passed that authority down to his successors, the men we now know as the Popes. The Catholic Faith has the fullness of apostolic authority, including the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation and Penance. No other church has that capacity.  \r\n \r\nThe Catholic Church bases Her doctrine on three things: Scripture, the teachings of the Magisterium (the bishops and theologians of the Church), and Sacred Tradition. Each one must agree with the other two and cannot contradict them in any way. \r\n \r\nDespite what the bigots may try to tell you, Catholics do not worship Mary or statues (idolatry) or place the Pope above Jesus. We do not believe in a "gospel of works" because our salvation comes from Jesus\' sacrifice on the Cross and nowhere else. Those are simply lies and slander put forth by the ignorant and uninformed. \r\n \r\nProtestantism began with Martin Luther, who objected to certain aspects of the Church. He broke away and began his own church, which has gradually split into hundreds of other denominations -- each with their own interpretation of Scripture. Other than the core belief that Jesus is Lord and Savior, there is no one set of definitive Protestant beliefs. \r\n \r\nMany Protestant churches do claim a belief in "Sola Scriptura," that is, "By Scripture Alone." However, each denomination\'s version of interpretation of what the Bible teaches differs greatly, accounting for the wide range of practices and beliefs between the various sects. \r\n \r\nUltimately, what Catholicism and Protestantism have in common is their love for our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Based on the answers from people like Mike and Pastor Art, I\'ll let you be the judge of which group is the more tolerant and compassionate of the two.          \nCatholics go to confession. Protistants cut out the middleman and go straight to God. Must be lots of Catholic Brothers and Sisters on here. My wife is Catholic. We disagree about this one.          \nCatholics do not divorce.  Protestants have branched out into a lot of weird fundamentalist churches.  I like the Lutheran church though.                               \nBasically it is doctrinal issues that separate both and this can be seen frequently here on answers and yet outside of this we are no different for all of us are born,suffer and die, and even more fascinating is that we can be quite decent to one another face to face. \r\nI guess the anonymity that a vehicle like answers provides, is a convenient way to vent bias and rage without the consequences! \r\nGod bless.           \nIn the begining of Christian religion, the Roman Catholics ruled the Christian world and the Pope was the \'big wheel\' representing God. When King Henry the V111 wanted a divorce, the Pope would\'nt give it to him so he started his own Church - The Church of England Anglican). It was very similar to the Roman Catholics except they had a new head guy in England. \r\nThen the Church of Scotland did\'nt like the Anglicans taking their money and bossing them around and ruling their affairs so they started the Church of Scotland.. (Germany Luther did\'t like the Pope making all the rules so he started his own Church. And so on and on it went, Baptists, United, Evangilistics, Mormons, etc.  Then a lot of those religions called themselves reformists and they again changed their biblical beliefs and made new rules.. The major difference is that the Pope has the final say for all the Roman Catholics and the others make their decisions by voting or having elders and Bishops make their rules and biblical interpretations.  \r\n \r\n          \nThe Catholics belong to the Church that Jesus founded.  The Protestants belong to sects that broke away from the Catholic Church. \r\n \r\nCatholics believe in the complete word of God...Bible and Sacred Tradition. \r\n \r\nThe Protestants follow a Bible with incomplete books and disregard Sacred Tradition (teachings of the Apostles), preferring traditions of men (teachings of their pastors) instead. \r\n \r\nCatholics compiled and canonized the Christian Bible.  The Magesterium of the Church (guided by the Holy Spirit) gives the correct interpretation.  Protestants rely on private interpretations of Scripture which is usually erroneous because they are separated from the mystical body of Christ (the Church).          \nGood question but it looks like its impossible to get an unbiased answer.  \r\n \r\nSome of the answers are somewhat right. \r\n \r\nCatholicism, as we know it today, was created by the Emperor Constantine in the 4th century when he brought all ideologies into one faith.  Since then there has been one leader, the Pope, and one apostolic church. \r\n \r\nBasic tenets of Catholicism have been laid out by other answerers but clear differences between C and P are that Catholics: \r\n \r\nUse the priest as the conduit to God.  ie They have confession.  This is a big difference. \r\n \r\nProtestants do not believe in an intercessor for their pleas.  They pray directly to God for forgiveness. \r\n \r\nSome one talked about the elements already.  Protestants believe only that the elements are symbolic of the sacrifice of Jesus.  They do not actually turn to his body and blood. \r\n \r\nThere are a number of answerers who have quoted from revisions in the Catholic religion that were based on the conference we call "Vatican II".  These revisions are more like instructions and guidelines than core beliefs.   \r\n \r\nI guess we would all agree that Cs and Ps differ on the importance of Mary.  Obviously, Protestants do not pray the rosary. \r\n \r\nSomeone alluded to the Wittenberg thesis.  These were basic changes that Martin Luther would like to have seen in the Church in his time.  Since the Church did not make the changes and ousted Luther - excommunicated - the Lutheran religion or Protestantism was born.  Obviously the new religion was free to make the changes. \r\n \r\nProtestantism and Catholicism continue to adapt to the changing world.  Each religion needs to battle to continue the edict of Christ when he left us, that we evangelize the world.  Some people believe that people have the right to chose between Chocolate and Vanilla.  Some people would rather have Strawberry.   \r\n \r\nI guess that might be an answer.          \nVirtually none, depending of course on the denomination of Protestant.  The core beliefs are EXACTLY the same.  The differences lie with terminology, semantics, and how certain traditions are recognized and how masses are structured.  There might be differences in decor in the churches.   \r\n \r\nIn my area, we have many Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, and non-denominational churches.  We are really all essentially the same.  What matters is how comfortable you feel in your chosen parish.  As a matter of fact, there\'s a saying around here that if you\'re Lutheran, you\'re practically Catholic, and it\'s intended as a compliment.            \nfirst of all the bibles are different, the king james is missing books from the old testament. they where taken out, because king james thought that they should be.  however i have read them, and they are indeed holy books that should be included in the bible.  \r\nsecond the Protestants change a lot. while the Catholics have been the same since they became one church some time after christ.  \r\nthe Protestant believe that they should live by the word and only the word, in which they do not, there are women preachers know.  \r\nthe Catholic show a lot of respect for the saints the help carry out the words in the bible. however they are not worship, nether is marry, but the Protestant say that we do. they do not acknowledge the history of the Catholic church, all of the teaching of the saints are not acknowledged.  \r\nthe Catholic believe that marry and the saint are like the angles that watch over us. they can be gods messengers.  \r\nthe Catholic church holds the communion service to be holy, as for the Protestant Churches say that the communion is not in the bread it is received in the heart. which is true, but jesus say for us to do this, so that is the one thing that a church should do.  \r\nand it is taken with win in a Catholic Church, while the Protestant is with grape juice.  \r\nthe Catholics believe the the teaching of st paul, so that is why they have priest. that conduct the mass. while preachers can just get up there and dance in the spirit. i fill more love from god when i am sitting still in my chair, then if i am dancing around and crying. that is human emotions that get out of hand, and not the true spirt of god. people should not be speacking out in church and drawing attention to there selves. but the catholics listen to scripture and that is what god wants. for us to show respect and be silent in church to understand the word, and know that we are small, and he is great. people do not go to church to here others speaking out in mass. that is not showing respect to god. that is being a show clown.           \n \r\nI\'ll touch on some of the issues where we differ. \r\nBelieve me, I\'d run out of room if we go into details,. There are over 33,000 different Protestant denominations in disagreement with each other...  \r\nI\'ll provide a few links to browes at your leisure. \r\n \r\nCatholics believe the Eucharist is truly the Body & Blood, Not a representation of it. \r\n \r\n \r\nCatholics follow Tradition. The Sacraments that the Apostles practiced. \r\n \r\n \r\nCatholics compiled the Books of the Bible: Protestants have Books Missing. \r\n \r\n \r\nTo validate that the Books Missing Belong: \r\n \r\n \r\nMatthew 23:2-3 \r\n[Jesus speaking] The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses\' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice.  \r\nIn the same way, post-Vatican II hierarchs (Breakaways)have authority but are now behaving abominably and corrupting the Sacred Tradition of the Catholic Church -- those traditions we are commanded to keep:  \r\n \r\n2 Thessalonians 2:15 \r\nTherefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.  \r\n \r\n2 Thessalonians 3:6 \r\nNow we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.  \r\n \r\nOur Lord founded a Church (Matthew 16:18-19), not a book, which was to be the pillar and ground of Truth (1 Timothy 3:15). We can know what this Church teaches by looking not only at Sacred Scripture, but into History and by reading what the earliest Christians have written, what those who\'ve sat on the Chair of Peter have spoken consistently with Scripture and Tradition, and what they\'ve solemnly defined. To believe that the Bible is our only source of Christian Truth is unbiblical and illogical.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThis is a good start. \r\n \r\nPeace be with You. \r\n \r\n(((Joe P))) Then why aren\'t you following the scripture that call for us to hold to Tradition?          \nCatholics believe the whole Bible, even the parts that are difficult. To be short: Anabaptists (Baptists, non-denominationalists, etc) forbid their infant children to baptized as Jesus instructed. Protestants, after Luther, follow the man-made doctrine of salvation by faith alone, contrary to Jesus\' statement that we would all be judged according to our works (Matt 16:27, Rev. 20:13 for ex.) and James\' statement that a person is justified by both faith and works together (James 2:17-26).           \nAt one time there was only one Church. in 1054 the Orthodox and Catholic Church split and in the 16th century the Protestant Churches were born. The difference is that the Catholic Church (and Orthodox) both preexisted the NT of the Bible and we use Church Councils to help us understand the faith. Some of those councils decided what books would be in the Bible and what books would be left out. No Catholic or Orthodox would say "we wrote the Bible". The Bible is the inspired word of God written by men under the inspiration of God. One of the big differences between us is the way we read Scripture. For Catholics and Orthodox context is extremely important and we spend much more time reading the context of the surrounding Scripture when we consider its meaning. The same applies to subject. I am always amazed when I find out how few Protestant Christians don\'t know that there are two sets of 10 Commandments and why we each follow different sets. It\'s in Scripture! The biggest difference comes from the writings of the Fathers of the early Church, those that came immediately after the Apostles. The CC and OC hold them in High regard and use them in helping us understand scripture. They are largely ignored by the Protestant Churches.  \r\nProtestants tend to be totally confused about our beliefs I recently picked up a book about Catholics and Evangelicals in Conversation. From the cover it appeared that it was an honest comparison between Catholic and Evangelical beliefs. When I started to read the "Catholic" responses I was shocked at the complete lack of depth and understanding of Catholic Theology. When I read "About the Authors" I understood what the problem was. Neither of the authors were Catholic. I still have yet to get any reliable information about Catholics from any Protestant source. The best example is works based religion. It is a complete twisting of our beliefs that is so great that I have a difficult time associating it with my own beliefs.              ',

	{'answer': u"\nYou are going to need to bring long pants and a jacket with you. You will need shorts too. \r\n \r\n \r\nIf you can change your hotel to a Disney resort.  Staying at Disney is my number one recommendation.there are many perks including free transportation direct to each park. Value resorts are a good price. \r\n \r\n \r\nTransportation. You can walk to downtown Disney and catch a Disney bus to a Disney resort (they do not go direct to any parks) then get off and wait for a park bus. Free, but takes a lot of time. \r\nTre Mears transportation , they have a web site.          \nProbably won't be warm enough for crop tops [?! - really?] and shorts.  Check the average temps for Orlando in December at one of the weather websites or, I'm guessing, on the Disney website. \r\n \r\nYou can rent a car for getting to/from WDW.  You'll pay for parking, but it will be cheaper than any bus for a group of people.          \nIt may get a little cool at night.  But a pair of sweats (pant and top) to throw on after the sunset will do.  Stay at a Disney resort.  You'll have a much easier time and more enjoyable vacation.          \nIt probably won't be very cold in December, but it will more than likely be too cold for crop tops and shorts. It will be a bit cooler early mornings and after the sun sets, so you will want to bring jeans/pants and some light jackets/hoodies. The middle of the day, with the sun out, will be warmer, so make sure to bring short sleeves, too. \r\n \r\nDo you have your heart set on staying at International Drive? If not, I would definitely recommend staying in a Disney resort. There are several that aren't very expensive, and to me it's so worth it. You will enjoy the benefit of free shuttles to the parks as a Disney resort guest. The extra money saved each day on transportation will make up for the extra money spent on the hotel.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    So I am going on holiday from 3rd december to 12th december to Orlando Florida from the UK. I have bought all crop tops and shorts and I am wondering if this was a HUGE mistake. I read somewhere when I first booked the holiday that it would still be warm enough to wear them but then another website seemed to think it'd be cold. Can anyone shed some light on this? \r\n \r\nSecondly, I have an iPhone 4S and I don't want to be able to use the internet on it so I don't get charged for it abroad. Is there a way to do this so I can still use it for the camera, but nothing else? What does airplane mode do? \r\n \r\nAlso, we are staying on international drive and don't want to pay the $17 a day for the bus to disney from our hotel. I have planned a route using lynx buses but it takes over an hour to get to disney. Is there any other way to get there? I know people say there isn't but when I went with the family about 5 years ago we were just walking down international drive and this bus came past with Animal Kingdom on the front, so I stuck my hand out and flagged it down, the bus driver only charged us a few dollars to disney and back. No idea what kind of bus it was though. Any ideas? \r\n \r\nThankyou in advance, if you can answer any of these questions please do :D  ",

	{'answer': u"\nI just did some research and found out that most of the attractions are open in november. Please take a look at  to see whats available in november month.          \nThis is when the hurricanes are likely to hit Orlando, but the rides are still open and the weather is still boiling hot. International Drive is a fantastic place to stay. Its right in the middle of all the major attractions,thats were i stayed. Have an amazing time!          \nUsually by November it is starting to cool off some; however, don't be surprised if it hits a warm spell and gets very hot, either. \r\n \r\nMain attractions, such as theme parks, are open year-round, 365 days a year.  November is a good time to go, especially if you avoid Thanksgiving week.          \nhi there, you will find the weather is very pleasant short sleeves during the day. there will not be too much rain in november as their rainy season are july to september. the main attractions will still be open but may close earlier in the evening that the peak seasons. I find that this is a nice time to travel to orlando as its not as busy and the weather is not scorching hot.          \nI live about  hours from Orlando, I am a FL native (lived here my whole life) Nov would be a good time of the year to travel, as hurricne season will be over, our weather starts to cool off (between 70-80's) and the parks are not over crowded.  \r\nAlso to help you save on tickets if you order ahead of time on the Disney website, order the tickets as a FL resident you will save $12 on a single day admission + more on additional days. You can enter a Florida zipcode, have the tickets mailed to yu, do not pick them up at the windows or you will have to show id. (you will have to enter a FL zipcode (33917) to access the special pricing page. Once you arrive you will have tickets in hand and wont have to wait in lines at the gate you can go straight through to the trams or ferry... Have Fun...          \nAll the attractions are open 365 days. I go to to florida every year. The weather is mostly very nice...around the mid 70's. it can however get chilly in the evenings. I would suggest going in mid to late December as Dec and January are the driest months for Florida....its citrus picking time....check out www.tripadvisor.com   search orlando hotels. it also has a great forum that will help you.          \nI've been 3 times in November and the weather is very good - perfect if you plan to do theme parks etc (which are all open).

	{'answer': u"\nYou will need to talk face to face with a high street broker for this one, as he will know which specific areas you need to cover and the most cost effective manner in which to do it for you. \r\n \r\nIn out local area house cleaners are earning on average \xa310 to \xa312 an hour , and that is via ads in local shops. You need to do some footwork in your areas and see what people will do the work for.          \nI work for an online business insurance broker so I hope I can give you some more details.  \r\n \r\nDamaging a customer's personal items while you're cleaning can easily happen. Often a situation can be resolved by replacing or fixing the item, so public liability insurance is a must-have when it comes to domestic cleaning. If you have a home cleaning business with staff, you also have a legal responsibility to take out employers' liability insurance. \r\n \r\nPublic liability insurance on its own shouldn't be too expensive but employers' liability insurance can really add to the premium.  \r\nHow many employees do you have? This would help give you an estimate in the premium you have to pay.  \r\nJasper Martens \r\nSimplybusiness.co.uk          ",

	{'answer': u"\nIf you don't know what it is, then I would guess that you don't have this insurance.

	{'answer': u"\nif you get sick easily, I would avoid rollercoasters full stop... \r\n \r\nThats my honest opinion...          \nWell, roller coasters there ARE mostly the ones that make you go AAGGHHH!!! And they do loops and are fast and twisty. So with you being like that.... I recommend you don't try them... \r\n \r\nX no way out, is a quite rough backwards ride... I wouldn't recommend it to you either LOL!  \r\n \r\nFlying fish would be good for you, it's a decent thrill, and not too fast either :) \r\n \r\nYou could also try the water rides, like Rumba Rapids or Logger's Leap. They don't spin. :) \r\nAnd, if you really want to, you might try Tidal Wave, a pretty tall water ride, and quite fast, and will DEFINATLY get you wet :P \r\nIt doesn't spin so you probably could try it :)          \nWell I'm sure when you get there you will already know this but DON'T go on these rides if you are easily sick from spinning; \r\n \r\n- Vortex \r\n- Zodiac \r\n- Storm in a Teacup \r\n- Samurai \r\n- Slammer \r\n- Quantum \r\n- Rocky Express \r\n \r\nI also wouldn't recommend rollercoasters to you either, especially Colossus as it does 4 barrel rolls in a row, as shown here;  (it doesn't go fast during that bit, but you might not feel comfortable if you get sick from spinning). \r\n \r\nYou should also avoid upside down coasters, so that rules out Nemesis Inferno and SAW - The Ride.  \r\nAs for X:/ No Way Out, well I'm not sure really. Do you only get sick from spinning alone and not any other type of movement? Because this ride is a backwards indoor rollercoaster, and although it can get quite fast it does do some sharp stops and brakes a lot throughout the ride. To be honest the ride really isn't that enjoyable because of the constant braking, go on it if you want but if the queue is long don't bother! \r\n \r\nSo basically, the rides you are left with are; \r\n- Depth Charge \r\n- Tidal Wave \r\n- Loggers Leap \r\n- Flying Fish \r\n- Detonator \r\n- Rush (doesn't spin but swings you back and forth) \r\n- Stealth (doesn't spin but does have a very fast launch!) \r\n \r\nNot a bad selection of rides; at least you should be able to go on the parks best ride - Stealth! \r\n \r\nHope that helped and have fun! :] (sorry it was a bit long)          \nWell avoid all spinning rides so zodiac, vortex, samurai etc. I know how you feel, I get sick from spinning on everything even wheely chairs :L. With all that n account try the following rides, these are in order of best ride. \r\n1)collosus - a must! \r\n2)rush -another must \r\n3)nemesis \r\n4)saw \r\n5)tidal wave \r\n6) no way out \r\n7)loggers leap \r\n8)detonator \r\n9)slammer (shouldn't make you sick) \r\n11)rapids - if you have time \r\n12)stealth - again if you have time \r\n \r\nThe last 2 rides are not as good as the others, so only do them if you have time (:          \nsaw the ride \r\ncollossus \r\nnemesis inferno \r\nstealth \r\nrush \r\nvortex \r\nslammer \r\ntidal wave \r\ndetonator \r\nno way out \r\nsamurai          ",

I wouldent mind a big scary ghost train as long as it doesent spin and all that buisness if they have one.

	{'answer': u"\nHello, \r\nMy name is Briante Smith and I live in Orlando. The best way to find out one place to another is to go on mapquest.com because it really has valuble information on how to get there. All you have to do is type in the place your at then type in the place you want to drive to then VIOLA!!!! All you have to do from there is drive and navigate. \r\n \r\n-- Have a blessed day!!!! and enjoy your trip :-)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!          \nCall your hotel... from the website there is transportation from OIA to the hotel for $19 one way \r\n \r\n          \nI just stayed at Holiday Inn Sunspree in Orlando because my husband had to catch a flight from Orlando International (MCO). Apparently this hotel had a shuttle service (independent from the hotel)  that could be pre-arranged (not complimentary, but cheaper than a cab). When my husband asked about such arrangements the night before his trip, they told him they didn't have one and proceeded to try to sell him on the idea of going to a timeshare selling presentation. We went to bed with the notion of having the hotel call us a cab in the morning.  \r\n \r\nMoral of the story: press them until you talk to someone who knows what they are talking about. It should have struck us as fishy that they didn't know of any shuttle services, this is one of the biggest tourist destinations in the world after all. BUT make sure you have your shuttle booked in advance and be ready five minutes before they're supposed to be there; they'll happily leave without you. Outside of Disney, in spite of Orlando being a hospitality town, don't expect courtesy or competence from many of the folks you'll run into. Oh, and you'll save about 20 bucks with a shuttle as opposed to a taxi.          ",

	{'answer': u"\ni laughed so hard reading this because i went for 2 weeks....2 weeks ago just got back so i can EASILY answer your questions  \r\n \r\n1.the weather is nice it rains frequently but useally last about 10-15 mins or less. \r\n2. Yes Tons of walking if your going to universal studios they have these walking escalator type things on the ground that help you go faster. I belive they have it for disney world too but thats only at the entrance after you park your car other than that your gonna walk a lot but its WORTH IT. \r\n \r\n3.wear shorts things you would wear in the summer flip flops sandals shorts etc. \r\n \r\nhope this helped          \nI am so excited for you. September and October are great times to go. The weather is hot (but not scorching like the summer) and you will have an amazing time at the theme parks - they are so much fun. Make sure that you comfortable footware. You will walk far if you do Disney parks but there are benches to stop and sit and monorails and trains to help you get around... \r\nTop tip - when you go into the park, even though you'll be tempted to go on the first thing you see and stop to look around - don't do it... have some strength and walk directly to teh back on the park - straight away - get there when it opens... they give you a map, then you will be in the empty bit for at least an hour and wont have to queue for rides, then by the time those people have filtered the back you will be near the front... it's the best way... it's hard to do because you'll want to stop and look at everything as you first walk in - but bite the bullet and just keeping walking. You can get monorail to the EPCOT to se the fire works as night - so you may want to carry a cardigan that evening just in case the temperature drops a bit - but mainly - it's shorts and Tshirts all the way! \r\nHave a magical time - I'm so jealous, I've been 4 times and love it. \r\nDo Seaworld as well and Universal Studios (Islands of Adventure) It's gotta be done. \r\nEnjoy yourselves \r\nx          \nSeptember is nicer than July and August, but is still pretty hot and humid.  You will do a lot of walking when you visit the theme parks, so it's best to wear shorts and a light shirt and comfortable walking shoes.  An umbrella or rain slicker is also useful;  the umbrella can be used for shade even if it doesn't rain.          \nSeptember/October is the best time of year here.  Expect highs in the mid 80's and lows in the low 70's.  Still hot, but not unbearable.  Dress comfortably, shorts and a T-shirt are perfect and are acceptable at almost any restaurant - everyone understands it's a tourist area and everyone has spent the day walking around a hot theme park so there's no need to dress up for dinner. \r\n \r\nBetter than the weather is going to be the crowd levels at the parks, September is one of the slowest times of year.  You'll be able to enjoy lots of short lines and even walk on to some of the big rides with no line at all. \r\n \r\nYou're, unfortunately, missing the best event in Orlando all year by 1 day.  Epcot International Food and Wine Festival starts October 1st.  During the festival they have about a dozen food stands set up around their lagoon that represent different parts of the world.  Each stand has a few small traditional dishes and a couple of local wines and beers available - awesome fun. \r\n \r\nIf you're into scary, then you'll just barely make the beginning of Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights (HHN).  The last weekend of September kicks off their huge Halloween event.  How big is it?  Well, they've already started construction on their ten haunted houses this year!  It's amazing, it's scary, and it's a must see. \r\n \r\nOh, and yes, tons of walking. \r\n \r\nIf you'd like to take a quick peek at a few reviews, some pictures of HHN stuff and where you may be able to grab an adult beverage to relax with then check out this site:          \nI'm in Orlando,Fl right now,and it's hot as hell.But don't worry.Florida is the best place for beaches.And of the course the weather is nice.And your going to Florida 10 days before my birthday:D Sept.27.1994:) \r\n \r\nEnjoy your stay at Florida! \r\n   Jaybree          \nhey , that ' s my birthday ! you might have possibilities w / hurricanes , but it ' s always warm in florida , some parts of the year is warmer than others , yeah , you ' ll have a lot of walking , i recommend a jacket , poncho , t-shirts , shorts , jeans , swimsuits , crocs , tennis shoes , i don ' t really recommend flip flops , undies .          \nFlorida honestly doesn't cool off until around November or December so it might be anywhere from 80-100 degrees in September, depending on hurricanes and such. September is during hurricane season so try to keep an eye on the weather channel and plan around the storms, if we get any. I live in Daytona Beach and have lived in Florida all my life so I'm used to the climate but I know Northerners find the weather ridiculous (as I can imagine). I'd definitely wear shorts and a tank top or loose fitting non heavy fabrics with tennis shoes to Disney. The parks are veryyy large and require lots of walking. Other than the heat, it should be alot of fun :)          \nyeah you will love it you are going at the best time of year we always go in the middle of sept as the schools are back and its alot quieter smaller ques alot of walking yeah most people wear trainers in the parks for the rides dont take dressy clothes for evenong its so casual out their folk just wear shorts etc at night you lucky sod i cant wait to go back u will love it! if u are hirig a car id advise you to go to busch gdns about an hours drive its the best park with lots of rolercoasters          \nThe weather is temperate year round, which I loved. I wouldn't say it's ever too hot, though I'm accustomed to hotter due to the varied places I've lived. It gets humid sometimes, but it's bearable. Shorts and t-shirts are what I wore for close to 10 months out of the year, though I opted for performance polyester (Coolmax, Dri-Fit, etc.). \r\n \r\nSeptember specifically, is one of my favorite times of the year. The color of the grass and trees are all bright. It's a bit cooler than mid-summer, but the days are still long with the sun staying out past 8 PM, and unlikely to get chilly during the night. Bug season lasts a bit longer in Florida, due to all the swamps and lakes and fair weather, so come prepared. \r\n \r\nThe parks are huge. Bring comfortable shoes and don't pack too much for days out in the park. Check the weather--if there's a chance of rain, check the radar/satellite and check the precipitation pattern so you know if you should prepare or go light. I only went once, since it was free for military, but I can definitely say there's little chance of visiting all the attractions of a single park in a day. A large brim hat might be wise if you care enough about your skin. \r\n \r\nRE above: it rarely rained from what I noticed. If it rains, it sprinkles or pours (scattered showers) for a few days and stays clear for weeks or months after. Also, while it's important to monitor for hurricanes, land fall is quite rare. I've only had to evac once in the 6 years living there. I forget which... between 2004-2006 one hit the panhandle area and I evac'd to Orlando. I might have missed some while deployed though.          \nIt will still be hot enough to enjoy the water parks so I wolud take advantage of those.  Wet N Wild is  small Orlando water park but lots of fun.  There are tons of stairs and walking so  make sure to bring water shoes or shoes you're willing to get wet.  \r\n \r\n It still might be raining in the afternoons so if you have a favorite rain coat you'll want to bring that too.  Otherwise you can buy an inexpensive poncho when you arrive. \r\n \r\nClothes should be light and comfortable but for two weeks I would pack a few nights worth of dressy clothes.  For those special nights on the town.  \r\n \r\n Tons of t-shirts and shorts.  Maybe your favorite pair of jeans.  And of course a study pair of flip flops (for around the hotel, pool or place that don't require heavy duty foot wear. \r\n \r\nIn the parks you will need a good pair of walking shoes. \r\n \r\nHave Fun! \r\nBuffy          ",

	{'answer': u"\nIt's peak hurricane season - it's not just rain, but torrential rain and high winds not to mention humid          \nWe went to Orlando in the summer.  You'll be fine!  Yes, you get get torrential downpours in the afternoon, but they are short lived and quite spectacular when accompanied with thunder and lightning.  It doesn't stop you going about your day, you just go get a coffee for hour or have lunch.  So I would say, go!   \r\n \r\nWe had a hurricane once when we were there, though that was at Easter, it was fine...mostly through the night, got up next day, sun beds in the pool etc.  But carried on and went to theme parks.          \nI go to Florida for vacations, usually the First week in September, after kids have gone back to school.  It is hot, steamy hot, and sweltering hot in August and September.  The temps get up to 95 degrees and 95% humidity.   \r\n \r\nWalking and standing on black asphalt all day can get uncomfortable.   \r\n \r\nIf you go mentally prepared, drink a 50-50 mix of Gatorade and water, and stay out of the sun in the early afternoon, you all will have a great time. \r\n \r\nIf you can afford it, rent a full-size or luxury car.  With the cheap, small cars and lots of people in the car, the air conditioning can get overloaded.          \nEvery time I have been in August it has been scorching hot and pretty humid.  It does rain for a few hours about 4 days in 7 but mostly the rain pours down like a monsoon for a bit and then stops - everything dries in an hour or less from the sun and you can resume the day out.   \r\nI have been 3 times in August and it only hailed once, in the evening at that and the stones were the size of popcorn.  Not bad enough to dent a car but bad enough to sting the skin (but nobody walks there anyway). \r\nI'd risk it if that is the only time you can go.  You will get at least 4 or 5 good days if not 9 or 10 and there are lots of great things indoors to see and do.          \ngo somewhere with a less intense august....how about taking the kids to a national park out west? They have amazing things for children to do and it is so much fun. My family always went when we were growing up and I liked it much more than disneyworld! (Grand Teton National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park) \r\n \r\nand btw - I am living in England next fall for school....I def. want to visit Scotland. Any suggestions from a native? :P          \nI would go.  I have been there many times in August.  It is the hottest time of the year and it is hurricane season plus it does rain during the day. \r\n \r\nBut all in all I would still go.  The weather is not too bad to deal except possibly during the middle of the afternoon.  You can always go back to your hotel and swim in the pool, visit one of the water parks or eat indoors if you get too hot.  My recomendation is to stay on Disney property this way you have free transportation to and from your hotel and all Disney parks and the airport which is very cost effective and convenient.  They also sell ice cream and little spray bottles you can fill with water that have fans these help a lot.  I like to buy the waterparks and more option with my Disney pass it is well worth the extra cost.  The water parks are lots of fun and a great way to spend the hot part of the day when you just don't feel like wasting time in your hotel but are too hot at the theme parks. \r\n \r\nAlso if you do go make your dining reservations as soon as you book your trip or if you book it too early then be sure to make them 180 days in advance. \r\n \r\nIf you would like more info on Orlando weather then here's a link           \nPlease do try to go to Orlando at another time because the humidity along with the park queues will darken your views of this totally amazing place.          \nAt least in Scotland it isn't about 100 degrees and 98% relative humidity! \r\n \r\nIt will be hot and humid.  Rain showers almost daily.   \r\n \r\nI would go, but be prepared for the heat with appropriate clothing, lots of sunscreen, good walking shoes, and stay hydrated.   Plan to get to the parks early in the morning.   Stay on Disney property at one of their resorts so you can take mid-day breaks to rest, maybe take a swim, then return to the parks in late afternoon.  At that ime of year, the parks will be open late, so you can stay until bedtime! \r\n \r\nIf you have the time, don't do all the parks at once.  Spread them out over a few days and do other things in between.  I would recommend the Unofficial Guide to Disney.  That book will give you lots of pointers about the best way to see the parks.  Also www.mousebuzz.com has great forums. \r\n \r\nGo to Cape Canaveral while you're there.  Enjoy your trip! \r\n \r\nBTW:  Disneyland is in California.  Disney World is in Orlando.          \ni have been living in orlando florida for over 7 years the time of the year that you want to come is just fine, yes it rains but mostly in the evening aroung 4:00 or 5:00 for about 1 hour and then its stops, the air smells so fresh after the rain, i love it, its just part of florida. Disney has alot of indoor activities as well so in the morning and afternnon you can walk around the park and ride the rides outside and then if it rains you can do the indoor shows and rides.  I work in the hospitality industry so trust me i know a whole lot about all florida theme parks. You will have a great time in orlando florida. Try to visit miami also.          \nYes it is that bad!!The rain over there is totally different to what we get here-it's like a tropical storm (I've experienced it and it aint nice so pack plenty of extra waterproofs!!).It's peak hurricane season that time of year.Not to mention the heat,humidity and on top of that the crowds.If you have younger kids then I wouldn't fancy trying to keep them calm and amused while standing in line for hours with thousands of other peoples screaming kids. I was lucky that our kid was 13 so able to understand the weather and waits.I've found the best time to go is April,but if that's the only time you can go then you have no choice. You have been warned!!!          \nI've never been to Scotland so I'm not quite sure what kinds of temperatures you get in August there but I can tell you that I moved from Canada to Orlando at the end of August and it was triple digits before the humidity.  Yes, it rained a lot at that time of the year (ie. at least once a day from when I moved to December) but it was the heat when I first moved there that just about killed me.  I was sick for a couple of days while my body adjusted.  However, if you are used to extreme heat at that time of the year, you may fair better than I did.  Drink lots of water and have a hat - hopefully that will be all you need.          \nIve been there in August and it usually rains in the afternoon but it's only for a couple of hours. Everyone always say the crowds are awful but we didnt have that much of a problem. Use the fast pass system it is really good and if you do have to queue the area is usually covered and protected from the sun. Make sure you have loads of water, sunscreen and a hat. Getting to the parks early in the morning means that you will be at the front of the line. Depending on the age of your kids also look at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Renting a villa is always a plus because you have your own pool but you would need a car.          ",

In addition to public liability you are more than likely going to need employers liability cover. Employers liability is a compulsory insurance and is required even if you are employing temporary of casual staff. \r\n \r\nThe premium is normally based on your estimated turnover and wage roll and insurers will need to know what the work entails and if there is any hazardous work. The premium will also depend on the public liability indemnity limit.

I went on Saw because I was forced to go on by my friends, I didn't want to make a fool out of myself so I went on feeling sick from fear, I closed my eyes with my head held down, holding on tightly as possible and I did it! I was well proud of myself afterwards, even though I didn't exactly experience the ride. \r\n \r\nIt was my first big ride and Im going to Alton Towers soon with friends again.

	{'answer': u'\nThey are not the same thing. The lake of fire is worse. Hell will eventually be thrown into the lake of fire \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:10 \r\nAnd death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.          \nNO. HELL is where ONE WAITS for JUDGEMENT then once JUDGED sent to BURN or ACCEPTED into the KINGDOM of HEAVEN after JESUS\' second COMING... \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:13-15 (New International Version) \r\n13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. 14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 15 If anyone\'s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. \r\n \r\nRevelation 21:4-8 (New International Version) \r\n4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."  \r\n \r\n5 He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."  \r\n \r\n6 He said to me: "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars\u2014their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."          \nBecause they aren\'t the same. Revelation 20:14 in the King James Version reads: And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.          \nIn the dead sea scrolls, there are 10 layeers of hell described. Tartarus, sheol, hell,hades, the pit, the lake of fire.  I find it interesting that science man claims that the core of the earth is a liquid, molten inferno (lake of fire)          \nthey arent.....hades and sheol and hell mean the graves \r\n \r\nLAKE OF FIRE IS INSIDE THE EARTH which is for the devil and some do call it hellfire..          \nIt\'s a mythical place borrowed from ancient pagan stories so it doesn\'t matter what the superstitious call it. It doesn\'t exist. \r\n \r\n@Godboy \r\nNo big surprise there. The ancients were aware of volcanoes. Extrapolating a kingdom of fire under the earth came naturally after that. Scientific observation revealed what was really there and it wasn\'t supernatural.          \nThere are several things that should be understood. First, those scriptures that mention Hell, usually have the words Sheol (Hebrew) and Hades (Greek) as the original word that is translated Hell. Many translations do not use the word Hell in these instances because is does not convey the actual meaning of these words. \r\n \r\nTo start off with, the notion of a place of torment, that being Hell is false. The bible clearly teaches that a person is a soul, and the soul dies with the body. Gen 2:7 Ez 18:4, Eccl 9:4-10 \r\n \r\nWhat also shows that when a person dies they are not tormented for their sins is Rom 6:7,23. Ask yourself, if you die and are acquitted or freed of your sins, why would you then be tormented for your sins? Also, if sins bring about torment, why would the scripture say the wages of sin is death and not torment? Wouldn\'t torment have a greater impact on the reader? Why did God tell Adam that he would die if he ate the fruit and not be tormented? Gen 2:17 Wasn\'t Adam\'s sin the worst of all? \r\n \r\nIf Sheol & Hades were what is called Hell, a place of torment, then these faithful persons from the bible were sent to Hell: Joseph, Job, Hezekiah and Jesus. Would God torment these ones? NO! So what is translated Hell is actually just the common grave of mankind. It\'s a state of nothingness. \r\n \r\nWith the first death, Sheol & Hades, there is the promise of resurrection, of both righteous and unrighteous who have fallen asleep in death Acts 24:15. \r\n \r\nNow Gehenna and the Lake of Fire are the same place. This is the second death. This is an eternal death, one in which there is no hope for resurrection. Fire is often used to describe this eternal judgment. Fire represented complete destruction, not torment. The fact that it is eternal means this death is permanent. God is a God of perfect balance. Eternal life or eternal death, not eternal life or eternal torment. \r\n \r\nSo what is really confusing the issue is that there is a mistranslation of Sheol & Hades. As well as the incorrect teaching of a fiery tormenting Hell. It simply does not exist.          \nBecause hell is lack of life in a body. Or death. \r\nLake of Fire is  whatever is destroyed is thrown in there. Once something is burned... it is gone. \r\ngehenna was a garbage dump outside of Jerusalem that was kept burning, in it were thrown trash, \r\ndisease ridden dead animals and the bodies of criminals that didn\'t deserve a proper burial in the earth. \r\n \r\nSo is this worse than the hell some mention? not inside the earth but on Earth?          \nThe Lake of Fire means everlasting destruction. Nothing comes back from the lake of fire. Death will be thrown into the lake of fire, this will take place after Armageddon. No more death or sickness.          \nThey are not the same thing. After the great white throne judgement takes place, hades, Satan and his daemons and everybody who did not accept Christ, will be thrown there, to suffer for all eternity. Hell is a temporal place where the dead stay. Those who have not repented of their sins nor accepted christ.          ',

	{'answer': u'\ndon\'t feel bad about yourself. one thing i learned is you have to put your heart out there and risk getting hurt. if your afraid to you\'ll never get anywhere. sometimes you;ll get hurt, sometimes you won.t          \nStella , u need to let him know how you feel so either way you can get closure from this. Feeling love for someone is an awesome feeling but true love can only be achieved when the person you love treats you the same way you are treating him. He must feel that u are as special to him as he is to you.          \nYeh Like DA-LL/Male/ said "if your afraid to you\'ll never get anywhere." well thats what life is about taking chances and making actions gotta live with or or without it..so choose find out that he actually did like you and move on, or know that he shares feels for you.          \nStella - gosh - your question could make me cry. You are so sweet. You have nothing to feel bad about as by your writing we can all see you are good, honest, cute, and so nice to everyone. \r\n \r\nAsk this guy if he wants to go for an ice cream again and he will know that you liked going with him the last time. Then while eating ice cream suggest that you should also do something else together sometime like a movie or out to eat or to a school or club dance. Give him suggestions so he knows you are willing to go out with him and will do things with him. Maybe he is as shy as you. Good luck as we are all here and wanting you to have fun.          \nI think u should tell him. If he doesnt love you then that is that. And if he does then it was all for the better. Ask before you drive yourself crazy.          \nYou have to kiss a few frogs to be able to spot a prince. \r\n \r\nWhy feel bad about yourself if someone doesn\'t share your feelings? \r\n \r\nGo to Christian Carter\'s www.catchhimandkeephim.com and read about the most common mistakes women make with men, love, and dating.  Women actually sabatoge their chances of findind a meaningful relationship by not understanding the way men think.          \nteal him and don\'t say no to sex on frist date it is 2006  not 1906          \nHi...I completely understand how you are feeling because something like that is happening to me right now. However, I even know who the guy likes, and she likes him back! But, I also know that one day I\'ll get over him... Anyway, I think that you should folllow your heart, but don\'t feel bad about yourself. If he doesn\'t like you, HE is the one missing it, not you. Personally, I think you should tell him, but tell him like if he was your friend, and just tell him you just wanna get to know him. If he is the nice guy you think he is, he will accept you and, who knows, once you get to know each other, you might start dating! I hope my advice helped....God bless you!          \nhe likes you, he is just awkward in expressing it.          \nPlease do not feel bad about yourself.  Don\'t you know that what you are going through is unreciprocated love?  Sometimes young people are just not ready for a heavy relationship.  He probably is enjoying his friendship with you and could be alarmed by your feelings.  You need to realize that you cannot control his feelings by being so giving and nice.  Pleasing people is the sunny side of control.  Just sit back and let him come to you.  You will be most attractive if you seem to have a vibrant and busy schedule of your own.  I would reserve my self respect  and take a wait and see approach instead of unloading your heavy feelings.  You think you feel bad now, think how you will feel by showing how needy you are. Your time will come, believe it.  Just never push your expectations on a guy and expect anything positive in return.  I have experienced where you are and so have all my friends.  But strangely enough, in the flash of one day, we all met "the one" and our lives were changed forever.  This will happen to you.  Just make your life exciting in other ways.  Be a friend to many people just like he does.  You WILL BE FINE.  Now, quit beating yourself up for nothing! Go live the life you deserve! Stop the the e-mails to see if you peak his curiosity.  You will notice that you will immediately feel better, because you retained the right to make a choice were HE is concerned. Trust me on this!  Preserve your power for yourself.  OK?          \nwell if you scared you he might say something you don\'t want to here. Just enjoy the days as they go with him. Not unless you want to talk to him and tell him how you feel about him. HE might just tell you teh same thing. But just go slow at first then when you get him alone tell him and see what happens.          \nThe first BIG Problem here I see,,,   Your Always looking for that special love,, You will Never find it until you stop looking so hard, If you want something So bad you can taste it,, usually for me anyway, it goes to the crapper before it goes good, just relax dont be in such a hurry to be in "love",    be yourself, you have the rest of your life ahead of you to find him or her,,          ',

I found Thorpe Park good for older children and adults, but Chessington is great for younger children too.          \nI would probably suggest Chessington as there are more rides for the younger age groups! \r\n \r\nAlso Thorpe Park is packed with secondary school kids for the next two months as they have their end of term treats!!!  Nightmare!!          \nnever been to chessington but thorpe park is brilliant lots of water rides and rollercoasters and stealth is fantastic          \nfor adults thorpe park is better, there are some kids rides, it will be fine for an 8 year old. Thorpe park also has a pretend beach and water place to play for younger children and there are some rides for them too. Chessington is aimed more at children than thorpe park, but theres not really much for adults there.          \nchessington is much better for children as at thorpe park there is a lot of rides they wont be big enough to go on          \nchessington is more for children. thorpe park is more for adults.  \r\n \r\ni would say chessington for the kids.          \nchessington 4 the little ones but thorpe park 4 the big kids          \nalthough chessington will be best for the 3 yr old, id go for thorpe park because the rides are better.

	{'answer': u"\nIf you really like to drive, these are doable. Large rental companies (Hertz, Avis, National) will let you rent in one city and return in another, although there's usually a drop fee. Compare prices, fees vary a lot. I presume you know that much of route 66 is gone, although you can still follow the route on other roads. \r\n \r\nI'd also suggest doing a little research on what you might want to see on the way. For example, in trip 2, Ithaca NY is much nicer than Binghamton, and depending on what you like, you might prefer a B&B in the nearby vineyards to either. Other than the rock and roll hall of fame, Cleveland is skippable, If you have any interest in US history, visit Williamsburg VA on the way to Richmond, perhaps taking an extra day. If you go during the summer, the outer banks of N.C. are worth a detour (partly by ferry) with a visit to Kitty Hawk, site of the first airplane flight.          \nComments on trip one: \r\n \r\n1)If possible it's also very worthwhile to drive up the CA coast from LA to San Francisco--the stretch of coast along Big Sur is arguably the most spectacular in the US, and Santa Barbara, Monterey, Heast Castle and Santa Cruz are worthwhile stops. You could add this to your trip by flying into LA, then driving to SF and carrying on from there. \r\n2) In addition to the places you list you might also check out Sequoia and King's Canyon National Parks (they're south of Yosemite) and San Diego (2-3 hours south of LA.) San Diego is also right next to Tijuana, though I'm not sure how safe it is these days. \r\n3) While Chicago is a fantastic city and well worth visiting, I'm not sure that I'd recommend Route 66. The road itself has largely been replaced by the interstate highway system (I believe that parts of it can still be used and other parts can't) and regardless, a lot of that route goes through some less than totally fascinating parts of the country. I'm not saying it's not worth doing, but there are probably more interesting places to spend your time and money (and driving a few thousand miles will suck up plenty of both.) \r\n \r\nThoughts on route 2: \r\n \r\n1) You might shoot to go through Savannah GA, or Charleston SC when heading to DC. I'm not sure there's much to see in Jacksonville, Florence or Richmond (though I haven't explored them extensively.) \r\n2) You might want to look into flying or taking a train into DC and New York. This is the most densely populated part of the US and driving in NYC especially is an unholy nightmare. \r\n3) There's not that much to see in Ohio. \r\n4) If you're shooting to see Mt Rushmore or the Crazy Horse monuments you might find it easier to fly. Also if you're going through all the trouble to get that far west, you might also check out the Devil's Tower (off 90 just inside Wyoming) or even go all the way to Yellowstone National Park.          \nTrip one, you could still stop in South Dakota by adding a couple of hours to the drive from Chicago to LA. \r\n \r\nTrip two... as a Binghamton resident, I agree and disagree with John. Ithaca is beautiful, however, Binghamton has some great attractions as well. If you are using it as a rest stop between NY City and Buffalo, is a perfect place to stop. You should also try our local favorite, the Spiedie.  \r\n \r\nAlso, Australia = 2,941,299\xa0sq\xa0mi and USA = 3,794,101\xa0sq\xa0mi... Alaska is 663,268 sq mi, so the US is still bigger by a smidge. :)          ",

	{'answer': u"\nhaha i think that'd be one hell of a thanksgiving          \nMy family and I spend the day after Thanksgiving at a strip mall. I asked this one clerk for a lap dance and she thought that I was a real turkey. Go figure. She was in a fowl mood.          \nI would definately add that to my list of things to be thankful for...          \nDoes this mean the turkey is stuffed with one dollar bills?          \nAs long as the strippers do not mind me dosing off ever now and then.          \nLast darn time I tell you about my family traditions!!! \r\nPeace.          \nI want to be nowhere near the club that has male dance  reviews that has my 97 year old grandma sticking dollars in the thong of Barbareno the Latin Hunk. \r\n I'll stay home and watch the leftovers and miracle on 34th street while laughing at the raiders playing the cowboys this thanksgiving. \r\n Hell. I'd rather stay home and do the laundry rather than that.          \nYeah sounds cool and I bet MeMaw is the one who has all the singles for the tuckin part. \r\n \r\nThe special for the night buffet is probly Turkey flavored baloney too. \r\n \r\nI think conventional is way over rated anyway, but I do like Thanks Giving meals, unless cousin Bubba sits next to me. Everything then smells like it was eaten a long time before.          \nCan I eat Thanksgiving dinner at your house this year? I'll bring the whiskey and the good sniffin glue.....          \nLOL - My wife actually asked me to take her to a strip club once just so she could see what it was all about. She even paid for me to get a lap dance. It was her only time in a club like that so I don't think your tradition would work in my family.          \nstrippers have families too.          \nWho says my family & I HAVEN'T done this every year? You joining us this year? All ya had to do was ask!          \nfrom Indiana right? and mamaw goes, wow          ",
	 'question': u"\n    Is it wrong if a SUV full of relatives always go visits a strip club Thanksgiving evening as a way of continuing the family get-together?  \r\n \r\nIt's mostly guys, of course, but sometime Mamaw goes too. Also, there is the one female cousin who goes along and always gets lapdances and tucks too deep.  \r\n \r\nIs this a charming family tradition that you would like to start in yours? After all, the Family that Tucks Together, Stays Together.  \r\n \r\nThanks.  ",

	{'answer': u"\nThat's what deposits are for. But if you are a business seller you would have known to have paperwork written up showing that it was a non refundable deposit.  If the customer is arguing with you then you need to decide if you want to just learn a lesson here and give it back or wait for them to give up or sue you.          \nThat is normal practice - you pay a deposit to reserve an item. If you subsequently pull out, you lose your deposit. \n \nYour only problem may come if you do not have that written into the agreement you made with her. If you just agreed verbally, you will find it difficult to enforce if she takes you to court.          \nIf you want to be kind you could give her a credit note against a future purchase, but there is no reason to return the deposit.

	{'answer': u'\nYes? Harsh I know.          \nWhen we know God, the Bible reads completely different than when we don\'t.          \nNo, a loving God wouldn\'t do that.          \nIn a word: NO.          \nIt is true! \r\n \r\nA place where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched.  \r\n \r\nAnd for those of you that know this gospel well, yet deny the free gift of forgiveness, is reserved the gloom of utter darkness.  \r\n \r\nRepentance toward the Father, and faith in Christ Jesus. \r\n \r\nHe died for our sins, according to the scriptures. \r\nHe was buried. \r\nHe rose again on the third day, according to the scriptures. \r\n~The Gospel~ Font and center, full and complete.          \nYES  YES \r\n \r\n \r\n which is the second death.\u201d  \r\n \r\nMatthew 10:28  \r\nAnd do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.  \r\n \r\nRomans 6:23   \r\nFor the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:14 \r\nThen Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.  \r\n \r\nMatthew 25:46  \r\nAnd these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.\u201d  \r\n \r\nWhat is hell like?The most common description of hell is that of fire.1 Here is a list of some of these descriptions: \r\n \r\nBible\'s Description of Hell fire and brimstone burning wind fiery oven  \r\nflames of fire judgment by fire unquenchable fire  \r\nfurnace of fire eternal fire eternal punishment  \r\nfiery hell pits of darkness lake of fire  \r\n \r\nPunishment and restraintSince there could possibly be a lot of party people in hell, one might think that it will be one big party. However, the problem is that the likes of Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and other unsavory characters will be there also. In order to keep those people from tormenting their neighbors excessively, all the inhabitants will be restrained through punishment (with the amount increasing with the degree of restraint required). This list below tells of some of the things that the inhabitants of hell will be going through: \r\n \r\nPunishment in Hell smoke of their torment2 no rest day and night2  \r\nweeping and gnashing of teeth3 tormented4  \r\ndeath5 their worm does not die6  \r\ndestruction7   \r\n \r\nWhy does there need to be a hell?This is a good question, since many would say that God could just destroy the evil people, rather than condemn them to a place of torment. The problem is that God made spiritual beings (humans and angels) as eternal creatures. In fact, the Bible says that God has put the knowledge of the eternal nature of our spirits within each of us: \r\n \r\nHe has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. (Ecclesiastes 3:11)          \nPeople have to recognize that the Bible uses spatial metaphors in order to describe Hell. Yes it uses the image of fire, but it also uses the image of Darkness(Matthew 22).  \r\n \r\nThese images are uses, not to pinpoint a specific place located under the earth where God throws people and has them tortured in an eternal Auschwitz. Rather, the point to the state of being of someone who rejects God\'s love.  \r\n \r\nDostoevsky in the Brother\'s Karamazov uses the best image when he says "I maintain that Hell is the inability to love". This means that you cut yourself off from God\'s unconditional love. And in doing so, as the Great Eastern mystic St Isaac the Syrian put it, our conscience then acts like the flame that burns our hearts with bitter regret. Like the bitter regret experienced by someone when they sever their relationship with their spouse          \nThere is the lake of fire in Revelation.  There\'s also the "eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels" in Matthew 25:41.  There is a debate about whether the fire is to be understood as physical or spiritual, and whether it\'s the same thing in both passages.  You might want to read about Darwaza, Turkmenistan before you write off the Revelation passages as purely symbolic, though.          \nAs with many biblical questions it depends on your interpretation. Some scholars will say yes and other scholars will say no. \r\nI personally don\'t believe that there is such a thing as hell, but that\'s just me.          \nThe bible is purely fiction. none of the content is true. Do you really believe there is some being out there with superpowers??? This isn\'t a movie, it\'s real life. Grow up and stop this god crap.          ',

Just let  her be and don't call her anymore..          \no_O you are upset because YOU broke up with a girl and she isn't weeping over it? I don't understand the question.          \nLook's like she cares less then you think xD Only one solution... ATTEMPT to get back with her. That's if she doesn't slam the door in your face first.          \nmaybe it was for the best that you broke up with her.. If shes not torn up about it at all, who knows how she was feeling in the relationship. But then again she might just be putting on a brave face and trying her best to get over you          \nIt's normal for you to be sad about a break-up, she was an important part of your life for a while. But she's taking it well, maybe it was a mutual break-up. It's bothering you though because she doesn't need you and you noticed (harsh I know I'm sorry). Just see how you feel in a couple weeks(try and keep busy) and if you still feel terrible go back.          \njust because she is still eating and sleeping doesnt mean she isnt upset. alot of girls bottle up emotions          ",

	{'answer': u"\nUm, that's just a mess. Everyone's wrong there. Child abuse, ect.          \nI would say the problems here go SO much deeper than any ONE of you not speaking the truth - but either way, NO you aren't a bad person but plenty of BAD, unhealthy, destructive, unhappy, miserable, professional help needing issues ARE going on in your household that your WHOLE FAMILY needs professional counseling with I would say!  THIS IS NOT normal or healthy for anyone!  Anger control issues, unkindness, lies, distrust, fear, and so on and so on.....  If someone were to have witnessed this event I dare say someone would have called Child Protective services.... : (  Yikes!          \nYour dad is abusive to your whole family, this is not your fault. An adult should not handle a situation in this manner neither should he be withholding food as a punishment. If this is a one time thing sit down with your parents and explain to them how this made you feel, this may not be easy and he may try to over power you but be strong and let him know. I have a feeling this is not a one time thing and if that's the case go to your school guidance counselor immediately, she will be able to help you sort out the situation. I went through this as a young teenager myself and it will only get worse if you do not confront the problems now, please take care of yourself and good luck to you.          \nwhy don't you go to dad and give him a big hug and tell him your sorry for lying to him and you was just trying to look out for sis, teaching kids not to lie and to be honest is very important to me and i am sure it is to him also, you would be surprised if you knew how many don't know the value of honesty, it is so sad because they go all there life lying and cant be trusted by anyone that knows them, From your dads point of view I didn't read anything wrong he has done, it's his house and i don't blame him for teaching his family the proper place to eat is at the dinner table, that little remark he made to your mother is most likely because your mother lies to him, if and when my daughter slams the door in my face her will be coming off, not ripped off but removed and TV would be coming out of the room as well along with her PC, Sorry to say I see no abuse or neglect what i see is two little brat kids acting like momma          \nYou should not have lied, but that is not an excuse for the way your father went off. It sounds like he some kind mental problem since no one gets along with him. \r\nYour mother should get him into some kind of counselling for it, if he will go.          \nLook this is not a good situation, you need to get help, talk to your sisters and call a family member if you don't have family members than call CPS and get help, get him in anger management or something, this is not a good thing. please get help talk to a teacher or counselor something please          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I feel bad for this. So yesterday my sister got in a fight with our dad and she didnt want to go downstairs near him. So I went down to get her dinner and my dad was like "What are you doing with that food" And I said the first think that came to mind. Which was "Its mine" And he was like "Eat it down here" And I said "You let everyone else eat outside of the kitchen!" And he said "Yea you ate downstairs" Which is didnt and I said "No i didnt!" So then I waited a little bit and my mom took the plate of food and brought it upstairs (She is fighting with him too). And he saw her go up. And he came out in the kitchen RIGHT after she went upstairs and asked where my plate of food was and I then Again Lied because if it saidn she brought it up to my sister he would know I lied the first time. And I told him "I ate 2 meatballs and was full so mom went to eat it" Then he went upstairs into my sisters room and saw the plate of food and found out i was lying. So then he went downstairs and I snook into my sisters room and he called me and I answered what and he came up the stairs and was like "WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME?" and I didnt really say anything and he was like "YOUR OFF THE COMPUTER" and I started laughing at him and he was like "ITS NT FUNNY!" and then I slammed the door and locked it and I was like "Whatever" And he was like "OPEN THIS DOOR" while banging on it and said "GO TO YOUR ROOM AND KEEP THE TV OFF" and was saying other stuff but I forget and I was like "Why are you gonna hit me?" and he was like "YES" and he hit my back and i was like "Why do you WANT everyone mad at you!?" And was like "WHAT? WHAT?" And I was like "You MANIAC" And went in my room and shut the door but he opened it before I could lock it and knocked down my picture that was behind the door and I went to pick it up and I had to shut the door to do that so i shut it and he opened it again and I was like "OW STOP HITTING ME WITH THE DOOR MANIAC" and he kept pushing it into me so I pushed it back and pushed him with it and he was like "STOP SHUTTING THE DOOR" but then I pushed it shut and locked it and he started banging on it saying "OPEN UP THIS DOOR!" and i was like "NO LEAVE ME ALONE" and that kept going on and then my Mom came and said "LEAVE HER ALONE" and they started fighting and My dad was pushing her and I heard my mom say "Go ahead! make me lose a baby!" Because she thought she was pregnant but she took a test today and she isnt. So anyways They were just fighting and I heard them swearing and stuff And My Mom was like "WHO TREATS THEIR 11 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LIKE THAT?" and I heard Him say "WHY ARE YOU TEACHING THEM TO LIE?" I started crying in my room and had to stay in their for the rest of the night and it was 7:00PM when that happened and I didnt get to eat dinner. So I kinda feel bad for this like I\'m a bad person. Should I? BTW my door is broken now.  ',

	 'question': u'\n    I was a teacher and head of a large department. I bought a laptop out of the Departmental capitation. I went part time and worked two days a week for two years using the laptop. During my two years I did quite a lot of unpaid work to support pupils. When I retired the Headteacher said he was very grateful for the time I\'d given up, even in the holidays. I asked if as  mark of his gratitude he would allow me to keep the laptop as a "retirement gift". He said he thought that was fair as did the Deputy Head (now head of another school) who witnessed the conversation. When the Head told the burser she wasn\'t happy and I was then told that the Head (he didn\'t say anything) had made a mistake and he thought it was one of the "old" laptops (I didn\'t know there were any in the school). It is about 4 years old, the DVD doesn\'t work and it\'s been rebuilt once. Hardly pristine. I\'ve also been told it\'s worth about \xa3200 or less. They are trying to get it back from me (not very aggressively it has to be said). I can afford to buy a new one but I feel the Head has reneged on a decision he clearly made and makes me feel that I have deliberately mislead him into agreeing to give it to me.  ',

This might not be the best ride for you! \r\n \r\nTidal wave - Big drop, but lots of fun!

Yes, I tell you, fear him. \r\n \r\nMatthew 10:28 \r\n \r\n28Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. \r\n \r\nRevelation 20:15 \r\n \r\n15If anyone\'s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.          \nYes I do and I forgot that ladys name but she told a strange story about the Jackson 5 going to the ED silicon show and being rapped by men back stage before there performance.

	 'question': u'\n    That is actually NOT the case. There will be no "eternal torment" in hell. That is slander against God\'s loving and holy name. Many people today falsely believe when the wicked people die they go straight to hell. That is NOT true. 2 Peter 2:9. "The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." This means there no soul in hell right now. God says he will hold back the wicked until Judgment day. \r\n \r\n"The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John 5:28, 29. "The wicked is reserved to the day of destruction." "Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb." Job 21:30, 32. God is very specific Both the wicked and the righteous who have died are in their graves "sleeping" until the day of  resurrection.  \r\n \r\nThe wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:23. "Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death." James 1:15. "God ... gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. The wages of sin or punishment is death no eternal life in hell. The wicked receive "death." The righteous receive "everlasting life." \r\n \r\nBut the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Revelation 21:8. God says the wicked will die the second death in the hellfire. The wicked will not be tormented in hell forever, if this was the case then they would be "immortal" That\'s impossible, because the Bible says God "only hath immortality." 1 Timothy 6:16. When Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of Eden, an angel was posted to guard the tree of life so that sinners would not eat of the tree and "live for ever." Genesis 3:22-24. The false teaching that came from satan that the wicked will be immortal in hell is not true. God prevented this when sin entered this earth when he placed an angel to guard the tree of life. \r\n \r\nThe Bible says the wicked suffer "death" (Romans 6:23), will suffer "destruction" (Job 21:30), "shall perish" (Psalms 37:20), will "burn" up (Malachi 4:1), "shall be destroyed together" (Psalms 37:38), will "consume away" (Psalms 37:20), "shall be cut off" (Psalms 37:9), "shall be slain" (Psalms 62:3). God will "destroy" them (Psalms 145:20), and "fire shall devour them" (Psalms 21:9).  Notice how all these verses make it clear that the wicked will die and be destroyed, not suffer in hell for all eternally. \r\n \r\nSo shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man ... shall cast them into a furnace of fire." Matthew 13:40-42. "They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them." Revelation 20:9. "The righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner." Proverbs 11:31. God himself will send the fire down upon the wicked who try to takeover the holy city that God sends down. \r\n \r\n"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up." 2 Peter 3:10. So basically the hellfire will be as big as the earth and the fire will be extremely hot that it\'ll melt earth and burn "the works that are therein."  Heaven will "pass away with a great noise." \r\n \r\nAnd, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be." Revelation 22:12. "And then he shall reward every man according to his works." Matthew 16:27. "That servant, which knew his lord\'s will, and ... neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." Luke 12:47, 48. God says according to the deeds of the wicked some will receive more punishment than others. That means satan will receive the worst punishment of all. \r\n \r\nBehold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it." Isaiah 47:14. "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth." "And God shall wip  ',

	 'question': u'\n    I\'m 15, and I\'ve never had a boyfriend, no kiss, nothing. I\'m fine with that. \r\n \r\nToday, my neighbor came over to my house to do some homework (his computer broke) and while he was doing his homework, we somehow got into the conversation of my non existent love life. He goes to me "So, you\'ve never had a boyfriend?" And I said no. And then he started to ask my if I was ever kissed, and I said no. Then, he effing goes on asking me if I\'ve ever seen a penis. WTF? It didn\'t go beyond that, but he kept on "making fun" of me because he said I\'m a nerd who reads too much who needs a life and a boyfriend, but he was like " oh no, just kidding" \r\n \r\nThing is, sure this kid may not really sort of be nice, but now I feel bad about that conversation. I certainly didn\'t ask for it, I barely even talk to the kid, I just do him favors like when he needs to use my computer. \r\n \r\nShould I just forget about it?

	{'answer': u'\nIf you are paid a wage via an agency you are a tempory worker -ie attached to thier company on a tempory basis - and as an employee - they are responsible for your insurance. IF however, you are supplying yourself as "John\'s labouring Services" and being paid by INVOICE - then you are a service providor and responsible for all your own expenses and requirements.  \r\n \r\nHave to admit the line is very fuzzy - employers don\'t want to provide hard hats vis and boots to new employees (even temps) but have to by LAW - so don\'t take any sh*t - but don\'t to subbies - but most contractors on site are subbies of some sort - but how they are employed is often tricky - and mostly due to tax loopholes.  \r\n \r\nThe way your wages are paid is the key. \r\n \r\nDave (Builder / Site Agent)          \nwhoever you are subcontracting to should have public liability insurance but you need to check because if something happened you would be responsible if it was your fault.          \nThe quick answer to this is YES! \r\n \r\nYou should have Public Liability insurance as you\'re self employed anyway.  \r\nYou don\'t have it for anyone else other than yourself at the end of the day. \r\nIt protects you against people making financial claims against you and it also protects you if you have an accident and you are no longer able to work.

	{'answer': u'\nIt\'s theoretically possible they\'ll review the footage and track the person, and the police could still show up. That having been said, if they didn\'t stop him (you?) at the time, it\'s unlikely they\'d even know to review the footage.  \n \nIf the person is now aware that this occurred, the correct action is to go back to the store, tell them they realized they had some flowers under their arm the other day they forgot to pay for, and pay.  \n \nEven if it was a mistake at the time, it starts becoming stealing more clearly when this person realizes what happened, and then intentionally chooses to not correct the matter. If it was truly a mistake realized later, the person needs to go pay. The really bad scenario is the police do show up, and the person tries to say it was a mistake, but then admits they decided to not go back and pay. At that point, being a "mistake" to begin with doesn\'t matter any more. And at that point, the "mental illness" doesn\'t matter either. The person needs to go back to the store and pay.          \nThis was just a mistake. he should go back to the shop with the flowers and offer to pay for them. Looks like no one noticed or cared. \nUK          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Now someone has confided in me in a mistake they made earlier. They have OCD, anxiety and depression and take tablets for it which make them feel very weird and spaced out. \n \nYesterday they bought some shopping in Tesco and then went back to get some sweets and flowers, putting the flowers under their arm as they had no free hands. Then they paid for the sweets and wasn't until they got home that they realized the flowers were still under their arm and hadn't paid for them. \n \nThis was a truly honest mistake. Now he is really worried and keeps saying a tesco staff member was looking at him but didn't stop him so if they noticed he had stolen why didn't they stop him? Also he knows the staff by name down there, they know his name, he paid by card and used his clubcard so you know clearly he had no intention of stealing from a place that knows his name! \n \nAnyway, my whole point is, if he goes into this store again can they take him into the office and charge him, get police involved etc because of this instance or not?

	{'answer': u"\nWhere's that?          \nmy least favorite ride is no way out i don't like the way it goes back wards then stops and goes again then stops there getting rid of it next year so that solves the problem of what could be done to approve it why did you not ask whats your favorite ride as well mines stealth          \nLEAST FAVORITE: \r\nDETONATOR Its very boring as it is just a 100 feet up and not at all scary! I like drops that are high! \r\n \r\nBEST RIDE: \r\nSTEALTH it is kind of scary and a lots of fun!          \nI don't think that I have a least favourite ride as I can't really remember what rides I went on. I have only been there twice, once with my friend and once with my old school. But I really liked no way out, that was so much FUN!!! Not many people like that but I love it. I suppose that I dislike the rides that go so fast you feel like you've just been sitting in the seat the whole time and realised that the ride was over. I get that alot in all the theme parks I go to, but I don't understand. Maybe I fall alseep on the rides without realising it, yeah that's probably it, or maybe I didn't want to go on that ride at all and went on it and forgot all about it. I don't know what to think. I think Chessington's is better, because they have more for the little kids and I love the Vampire Ride that is so amazing. \r\n \r\nAm I boring anyone yet???!!! LOL          \nI think Thorpe park got some great rides....personally i don't like detonator slammer or the swing....but that's because i really only like roller coasters not bother about the rest. But no way out definitely needs updating. A ride in the dark is great, but it should be more like the other roller coasters...how about getting a loop or a twist in it. \r\nBut stealth is definitely an amazing ride! and lets not Disney it!!!!!          \n1st kona \r\n2nd pesky \r\n3rd goz          ",

	{'answer': u"\nIn the 1800's people who lost a spouse would not remarry and they would wear black clothes to the end of their life which may have been 70 years in some cases.  They weren't miserable it was their custom out of respect for their loved one.  They would however hire people to cry, mourn and wale at the person's funeral but some funerals were celebrated with jazz bands and such so I don't get what you're saying about liking the dark clothes and being miserable since it sounds like it has nothing to do with the mourning.  See people mourn a loss of any kind not just death but they are not mourning as you describe it because of the person or pet that passes, they are mourning for themself because they don't know how to go on when this person or pet goes away.  The internet has a list of 10 steps to mourning that if a person has a problem they should go to.  Even psychologists send them to this list.  There is no reason at all to cut or want to die, that's not even reasonable and certainly isn't mature either or even using common sense.  Certainly to shed a few tears and do what's necessary to get the person or pet who passed into the ground is what's necessary but from that time on it's all custom and tradition if you wish to visit a cemetery or remember them with a prayer.          \nWhy would you want to become part of a stereotype? Sometimes, I think about running into the kitchen and just slicing and dicing my wrists, but I don't. I don't want to scare my mom. I just want to be a character designer when I grow up. I feel like being emo is just being emotional. EMOtional. You don't have to slit your wrists. I'm pretty over-dramatic and sensitive, but my apathy washes some of my inner-turmoil out...          ",

	{'answer': u"\nstealth and saw! \r\ni was at thorpe park about a week ago, and those were my two favorites. get fastpasses for them when you first get to the park though, theyre only about 3 or 4 pounds and its so worth it, you basically skip the entire line which is like 70 minutes. \r\nhope this helps:)          \nDefinatly agree.....stealth and saw. Amayzing. But you will need to buy fast track passes otherwise you que for at least an hour. Enjoy it!!          \nStealth and Samurai.  \r\n \r\nBy the way, as the other two people stated; you CAN not buy fast passes for Saw. \r\n \r\nAlso I wouldn't say Saw is my favourite, just cause it's under 'media hype' theres nothing great about it. Just a 4 hour queue and a huge disappointment for me.  \r\n \r\nStealth is worth getting fast pass which has samurai inclusive in it. Both are great, probably Samurai is better as Stealth ends in 14.2 seconds flat lol :)          \nStealth is alright but Colossus is waay the best ride there!          \nYep STEALTH is definatly the best ride there. The others are good but no way near as good as Stealth! The only downside is it's too short. \r\n \r\nAvPenguin: Stealth does NOT move that quickly, I was in it for atleast 45 minutes when I first qued up, maybe even an hour. You just got lucky the times you went. :p \r\n \r\nSaw ques are just ridiculus for a ride so bad, it doesn't matter if the back is better than the front, it's terrible for being that bad at the front in the first place and being that badly made. Uncomfortable and quite boring for me. Was a waste of 2 hours! Though a lot of people like it for some reason. \r\n \r\nI don't really hear that much great things about Rush, probably because it's always down and is way too short to really enjoy. It's good but not as good as Vortex I think, you get more of a rush on that than Rush. :p \r\n \r\nStealth, Vortex, Nemesis Inferno I'd say are the best ones there. Slammer is good but more scary than enjoyable, lol.          \nstealth and saaaw becuase they are the most daring and most fastest rides there but u will have to get the fast track or your skrewed oh yea if it is hot tidal wave is the 1 for u \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n                HAV FUN GO ON STEALTH IF IT IS NOT CLOSED \r\n                               GET FAST TRACK          \nI have never been to Thorpe Park.

	{'answer': u'\nYou don\'t need public liability insurance but they do so I would check to see that they have it.          \nYou can get event insurance but that will likely cost about $750.  You may want to check with your homeowners insurance company.  They may provide the liability, for free.          \nIf you placed your vehicle or residential insurance through an insurance broker, then go back to that same broker and tell them you need an "Event Liability" policy (direct writers do not do this type of policy, so if you went through a direct writer haul out the Yellow Pages). This policy will cover an event with or without liquor liability. This type of policy can last from one day to several days. The premium for this type of varies as it is affected by such things as: the type of event (i.e. wedding, sporting event, charity concert, trade show, etc); the number of people attending; whether event is open to the public; if anything is being sold at the event; whether liquor liability is required. I have sold this type of policy for $150 (including liquor liability) for a small, private party (less than 100 people) and I have sold this type of policy for $1,100 (four day performance art festival which was open to the public where alcohol was sold), so as you can see the price can vary. Be aware that unless this is a small party (i.e. less than 30 people) and no alcohol is being provided no personal lines insurer would extend liability to cover this type of event. This is too large a risk for a personal lines insurer.          \nif you are in australia - you may have an extension of cover under your HOME CONTENTS policy for accidents that occur while you are away from the insured property.  This may respond, unless they want you to get special event hire cover. \r\n \r\nThat seems like a really weird request to me.  If someone decides to sue you over injuries that they get at the wedding (ie tripped over a chair) etc - i\'m not sure why the venue cares about this?  it\'s not like they will be implicated?  if someone tries to sue you because part of the venue fell on their head, then this would be the responsibility of the venue owner - and they would (or should) have their own cover?? \r\n \r\ni would contact an insurance broker, bring the terms and conditions of hire with you and let them take a look at it and advise you further.

In 1938 the Hungarian Biro brothers out of Argentina retooled and manufactured such an instrument worldwide. \r\n \r\nThe Bic Pen Company bought out that Biro patent and thus far sold 100 billion of those ballpoint pens worldwide. Needless to say Bic redesigned that pen and today it out sells all other models.

	{'answer': u"\nthe saw ride          \nTop 5 rides : \r\n \r\n1. SAW ~its not that good as what everyone else makes it out to be) \r\n2. Colossus \r\n3. Stealth \r\n4. Nemesis \r\n5. Rush \r\n \r\ni would recomend that you run straight to SAW if you get there when the park opens, then you only have to queue like 20 mins or 30 mins instead of 3+ hours \r\n \r\nhope that helps :) x          \nWell of course, everyone is raving about the new Saw ride but Collosus is by far the best ride there! :)          \nTrust me when i say nemesis is the best ride there, its not as good as SAW, colossus is 2nd best \r\n \r\n1) Nemesis \r\n2) Colossus \r\n3) Stealth \r\n4) SAW \r\n5) Slammer          \nThorpe park is amazing. \r\n \r\n1- SAW - The ride. BY FAR! \r\n2- Nemsis Inferno. Very good ride, but your picture is only in twos, even though you sit in fours. So make sure you sit next to the person you want a picture with! \r\n3- Rush. Very good ride! Everyone chickens out of it because you only have a bar on your waist to keep you in. But if you had any other support it wouldn't be fun because the view makes the ride more better! \r\n4- Stealth. OMG! Just make sure that when it goes your looking good, because it comes over as a shock, and the camera is when it goes. ;) \r\n5- Vortex. Its a good ride, but its not very scary. \r\n \r\nTip: \r\nIf you decide you want to go on SAW (you have to, its amazing), get there before it opens and when everyone can start going in run to saw, and I mean RUN. Me and my mates did this and only had to wait 5 minutes instead of 3 hours! It doesn't matter how old you are, just run like a 5 year old! And when you get to SAW (its near colossus if you have never been there before. Make sure you have your map with you so you know where it is when your running) you are held at some gates, then they release them and everyone runs like hell. Make sure you run past the mini shop on the right, that's outside the ride, because everyone runs left! \r\n \r\nGood luck and have fun!          \nSlammer.  \r\n \r\nSaw is a fantastic ride, but it has been hyped up too much.          \nStealthh :)          \nTop Five. (Trust me, been to Thorpe Park WAY to many times) \r\n \r\n1) Nemesis \r\n2) Vortex < (Gotta try that one its the very 1st ride at the entrance) \r\n3) Colossus \r\n4) Stealth (that's usually the biggest que try that first) \r\n5) Slammer \r\n \r\n(I cant recommend SAW: The Ride, because i haven't been yet this year going in June :D )          \nSaw Ride!!!

	{'answer': u'\nNo they are being torchered. Haha. Dude they will be begging god to let them out. For all of eternity. And well the true victory is eternal torment. If he let them die, then they would miss out on the torment and not suffer. He will make them suffer and that is the true victory. By the way Islam is the truth. You might want to look it up if you are confused with Christianity.          \nSatan and his demons are not in hell yet.  They currently have freedom to roam, but are limited in what they can do. Eventually after Satan\'s plans come to a head, he will be chained up and his pals tossed into the lake of fire when Christ returns to earth. It is all in the book of Revelation. \r\n \r\nWhat they can and can\'t do in the lake of fire is anyone guess, but it suppose to be torment forever. The Lake of Fire is called the second death for some reason.          \nSome interpretations of the bible lead people to think that Hell is the state of annihilation and not a literal place. Try veganism, it\'s holy.          \nSatan and his demons are on earth. It is my understanding tht in the end they will be cast into hell and torchered for eternity with the nonbelievers. God has victory over evil because god rules over hell.          \nGood thing that eternal torment is a false doctrine. \r\n \r\nTruth about Hell \r\n  \r\nThe Bible teaches the TOTAL DESTRUCTION of the lost. This includes body and soul. (Matthew 7:13, Phillipians 3:18, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, Matthew 10:28, Psalm 5:6, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 21:9-10, Psalm 28:4-5, Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 92:7, Psalm 145:20, Proverbs 10:29-30, Isaiah 1:28, Isaiah 26:14, Luke 17:26-30, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, Luke 17:28-30, Joel 1:15,) \r\n  \r\nThe wages of sin is DEATH (Romans 6:23, Genesis 2:16-17, Ezekial 18:4, Isaiah 26:14, James 1:15, Ezekial 33:11) \r\n  \r\nThe wicked will be DEVOURED, BURNED UP, and CONSUMED (Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 104:35, Isaiah 1:28, Psalm 21:8-10, Psalm 50:3, Ezekial 22:31, Revelation 20:9, Isaiah 1:28, Psalm 104:35) \r\n  \r\nThose who reject Jesus will PERISH (John 3:16, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 10:16, Psalm 37:20,38, Psalm 97:3, Psalm 68:2, Luke 13:5, II Peter 3:9, Psalm 68:1-2, Psalm 37:20, Isaiah 41:11, I Corinthians 1:8) \r\n  \r\nThe lost will be SLAIN CARCASES (Psalm 139:19, Isaiah 11:4, Isaiah 66:15-16, 24) \r\n  \r\nThe wicked will be NO MORE, COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN, THEY WILL BE AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED. This cannot be true if they will be tortured forever in Hell because they would still exist and would not be forgotten. (Obadiah 1:15-16, Psalm 9:3,5, Psalm 37:10, 20, 38. Psalm 104:35, Isaiah 26:14, Psalm 140:10, Isaiah 41:11-12, Psalm 37:9-10, Proverbs 2:22, Proverbs 10:25) \r\n  \r\nThe fire shall not be quenched does not mean the fire will never go out but rather that it will keep burning until it is finished consuming its fuel. Carefully read these. (Jeremiah 17:27, Jude 7). Are either of these burning right now and will continue to burn for eternity or did the fire totally consume them and leave them as ashes?  \r\n  \r\nThe unrepentant will be ASHES. (Malachi 4:1-3) \r\n  \r\nThe Bible is clear that those who have the Son have life. Those who do not have the Son do not have life. What is the opposite of life? DEATH. Not eternal torture. (I John 5:12) \r\n  \r\nJesus describes it as eternal punishMENT not eternal punishING (Matthew 25:46) \r\n  \r\nThe soul is not immortal. It can die (Ezekial 18:4, Matthew 10:28). \r\n  \r\nFor more info exposing the false doctrine of Eternal Torment: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n          \nThe afterlife domain cannot be compared to this existing phase. \r\nOver here we \'live and exists\'. Over there we either live or exists. \r\nShould we exist without living then the \'time factor\' would be phased out and the torment that we would endure would consists of the \'acts\' that we had performed that had been meant to instill pain and harm. \r\nThis \'pain and harm\' would not be altered or changed which would hurt us eternally in the same manner as it had been meant to hurt others. \r\nWithin this static domain only internal combustion would be made, and God\'s victory would be claimed since He has done all He could to save us all.          \nthe english confuses many about this subject \n \nthe PUNISHMENT (is ETERNAL) \nnot the torment \n \nsouls shall perish \nit is called the 2cd death for good reason \n \n \nsee Rev 20  \n \n \n \nHbr 12:29 For our God [is] a consuming fire.  \n \n \n \nsatan is going to become ashes (is this eternal torture)? \n \nhell shall not exist forever....(is this ETERNAL)? \n \nthe verses for help \n \n \n \n Rev 20:7 \xb6 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,   \n \n \n Rev 20:8   And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom [is] as the sand of the sea.   \n \n \n Rev 20:9   And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.   \n \n \n - this is the 2cd death......(for these) \n        this is not eternal torture.... \n \nverse 20 is the verse that confuses things.... \n \n \nbelow shows satan (he is this king of Tyre) \nis this eternal torture..... \n \nEze 28:16   By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.   \n \n \n Eze 28:17   Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.   \n \n \n Eze 28:18   Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee,  \n==> and I will bring thee to ashes <==  upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.   \n \n \n Eze 28:19   All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee:  \nthou shalt be a terror, => and never [shalt] thou [be] any more.  <= \n \nthe smoke of this goes up forever and ever (this is the point of Rev 20) \n \nHELL or DEATH shall not exist once the ETERNITY begins \neveryone who overcomes shall have an immortal soul.... \n \n \nStrong\'s Greek Lexicon Search Results \n \n---------------------------------------... \n \n \nResult of search for "deathlessness": \n110. athanasia ath-an-as-ee\'-ah from a compound of 1 (as a negative particle) and 2288; deathlessness:--immortality.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhere is the word blot (just to make sure you understand this) \n \n \nExd 32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, \n Whosoever hath sinned against me, \n==>  him will I blot out of my book.  <== \n \nLexicon Results Strong\'s H4229 - machah \u05de\u05b8\u05d7\u05b8\u05d4 \nTransliteration \nmachah  \n Pronunciation \n \nm\xe4\xb7kh\xe4\' (Key) \n \n  \nPart of Speech \nverb \n \n Root Word (Etymology) \n \nA primitive root  \n  \nTWOT Reference \n1178,1179,118  \n  \nOutline of Biblical Usage  \n1) to wipe, wipe out \n \na) (Qal) \n \n1) to wipe \n \n2) to blot out, obliterate \n \n3) to blot out, exterminate \n \nb) (Niphal) \n \n1) to be wiped out \n \n2) to be blotted out \n \n3) to be exterminated \n \nc) (Hiphil) to blot out (from memory) \n \n2) (Qal) to strike \n \n3) (Pual) full of marrow (participle) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n - i hope this helps \n \n \n<><          \nSatan, his demons and all unsaved will end up in the lake of fire and be tormented forever, day and night, never knowing any rest. They will curse God once it sinks in that they\'ll never get another chance to repent, but what will that be to the Lord?  Meanwhile Jesus Christ and His followers will reign victorious on earth, for eternity.  \r\nRead Revelation, chapters 19 thru 20.          \nREAD THIS BOOK! \r\n \r\nThen God said to me, \u201cThere will be times that I will speak to you in \r\nthe Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek languages.\u201d God began to speak to \r\nme in the Hebrew and Greek languages. He said to me, \u201cThere are \r\nfour words that I am going to use that are throughout the Bible to \r\ndescribe Hell. The first is a Hebrew word, Sheol [sheh-ole\u2019], which \r\nis the world of the dead or the grave. This place is where the souls of \r\nthe ungodly and the godly men and women came when they died \r\ncenturies ago. The second is Greek\u2014Hades [hah\u2019-dace], which is \r\nthe place of departed souls and spirits, or where a sinner goes after \r\ndeath. However, before my crucifixion and resurrection, Hades was \r\ndivided into two sections that were separated by a large impassable \r\ngulf, which I created. The upper right side of Hades was called both \r\nAbraham\u2019s Bosom and Paradise. The Room of the Cursed is a portion \r\nof what once was Abraham\u2019s Bosom in Hades. I will allow you to see \r\nthe Room of the Cursed before your tour comes to an end in the \r\nOuter Darkness of Hell. In the cursed Paradise of the Outer Darkness \r\nof Hell, it was very pleasant. It had streams of water running through \r\nit, and green trees. It looked much like a beautiful well-maintained \r\npark. It contained the souls of all of those persons who had died and \r\nput their trust in me as God during the Old Testament period, up until \r\nthe time of the death and resurrection of your Lord and Savior Jesus \r\nChrist. All those human spirits that were in the Paradise of Hades \r\n[Hell] were very much conscious. They were not soul-sleeping. They \r\nwere quite alive. After the crucifixion, I spent three days in Hades, \r\npreaching to the spirits that were there.\u201d \r\n \r\nThe third word to describe Hell is also a Greek word, which is \r\nTartaros [Tar-tar-os\u2019]. Tartaros is this portion of Hell that I want \r\nyou to see specifically. This is the reason why I brought you here to \r\nHell: so you can be a witness to all back on Earth, testifying that \r\nthere is a place of severe punishments and judgment for those who \r\ndisobey my Holy Word, which is called the Holy Bible. This place is \r\ncalled the Outer Darkness of Hell. Tartaros has many jail cells. I \r\nspoke of Tartaros in my Holy Word. This portion of Hell contains the \r\nangels who sexually sinned with the women of the Earth before \r\nNoah\u2019s flood. I only mentioned Tartaros one time throughout the \r\nentire Bible: in the book of 2nd Peter, the second chapter, verse four.\u201d \r\n\u201cFor if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down \r\nto Hell [Tataros], and delivered them into chains of darkness, \r\nto be reserved unto judgment;\u201d - 2 Peter 2:4 KJV \r\n\u201cThese are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a \r\ntempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.\u201d \r\n2 Peter 2:17 KJV \r\n \r\n \r\nWhile Out of My Body, I Saw God, Hell and the Living Dead \r\n \r\nJesus is the only way.          \nSatan and his army can\'t mess with Jehovah God because it already proves in the Bible [ Read whole Matthew Chapter 4] \nDon\'t worry Satan and his punks won\'t last long. [ (Revelation 20:9, 10) And they advanced over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down out of heaven and devoured them. 10\xa0And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet [already were]; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.]          ',

I am kinda proud to be a Top Contributor          \ndont answer in this section till its gone lol          \nIgnore \n \nETA- oh, look, I still have one.          \nYeah - it can be embarrassing.  I learned to live with it, but "thank god" (lol) I haven\'t had one for a while.          \nThey took mine away for awhile because of all the horrible things I said about...well, just about everything, but now it has reappeared. I suppose it\'s a bit like the scarlet A...it\'s our destiny to wear it.          \ni do ignore it, because there are some who are just not worthy of it. its not a badge of honor for some who are point gamers.  \r\ni myself wonder why i never received one, ive been on R&S for more than ten years and with two different accounts. the first one was deleted when it was wrong to say the word prostitute while quoting scripture.          \nWell if I had that problem I would take my orange Gibson Les Paul guitar and plug it into my orange amplifier and play some orange blues.          \nDon\'t try and act cool, it just isn\'t you, we all know that you cheated for hours to gain that          \nIt\'s a sign that your contributions are of the highest quality.   \r\n \r\nYou should be proud.          \nI just go on here to have fun, i got nearly 1k points this week (last week I got 700ish) but the problem is that people dont like to choose their best answers (most of them are still open) so im stuck with a bad 9% best answers. And i really doubt they will give it to me anyways because im such a troll lol          \nI wouldn\'t know? I\'ve got six years running in this god forsaken wilderness without ever being oranged, eh:o)          \nSurer, don\'t ASK a lot of dumbass questions. That is the only way to get that badge apparently. because answering question will not get it.          \nIt means you are on here a lot.  But that is no worse than spending all of your time in front of the TV or in a casino.   \r\n \r\nAt least you can learn from this site (the info is questionable-but you can learn a lot about the psychology of people.)          \nIt\'s a sign that you\'re unemployed and don\'t have a life.          \nim glad i don\'t have my badge anymore, it really sucks, \n \nto earn a top contenders badge, you have to have  12% BA. in a particular section. \n \n \nto get rid of your badge, you have to answer less than 50 questions per week for about 3 weeks. in your section. \n \nto maintain your badge. you have to answer 50+ questions per week.          \nWow, look at you, all fancy and stuff.  That\'s kinda sexy.          \nIt\'s proof that you\'re spending a crapload of time here.  It goes away as soon as you get busy with your waking life.          \nGetting one is easy. Answer 50 questions in one category in a week (Midnight Sunday/Monday PST to midnight Sunday/Monday), and have a ten percent BA in that category for the week. \r\n \r\nWhat sucks is it takes like a month to lose the badge. I should lose mine next Monday for dipping under fifty answers in R&S for what I think is the fourth week in a row.          \nI just avoid this place until it goes away. Then I laugh at the fact Yahoo! would actually give a Top Contributor badge to an irrelevant poster like me.          \nI laugh at it, darling...considering the silliness of some of my answers, for Yammie to think I\'m a TC is either hilarious or very, very sad. \r\n \r\nI choose to go with hilarious. \r\n \r\nI attribute mine to my prolific and enthralling contacts, who keep drawing me in with their excellent questions. \r\n \r\n(((DD)))          \nMaybe it is a sign of popularity.

	{'answer': u'\n"should I feel bad for making him take me all these places we live 40 min from my doctor??" \r\n \r\nNo, but at this point you might want to get a good book on pregnancy and see if you can\'t do a little reading to ease your mind, and cut down on your ER visits. You went to the ER because you tripped and fell? What did you expect would happen there? You can "hardly breathe" and want to go to the ER -- but not immediately? These things are not emergencies; hyper down, kiddo.          \nNo, you have a medical emergency.  If you were waking him up to take you to a shoe sale, then you\'d be wrong.  But not because you have to seek medical help!          \nI wouldn\'t feel bad asking my child\'s father to help me, but suggest getting a car as soon as you can afford one.  You don\'t want to be stuck in the house all night while he is working.          \nNo way, don\'t feel bad. Things like that happen. It will get him used to what it will be like when the baby comes! lol. \r\n \r\nCute name by the way. My baby is named Hurley : )          \nI wouldn\'t.  Baby is most important and u gotta do what u gotta do.  U r right...when the baby comes...sleep goes out the window...          \nno he should want to make sure you and the baby are ok. I understand how you feel though i hated waking up my guy who worked from 3pm-2am depending on the day sometimes he wouldn\'t get back until even later (so we just tried to schedule things on his off day). But he shouldn\'t really mind as long as its not \'hey wake up and watch this show with me\'. if your hurt he should be there to help. Can you drive yourself sometimes? I mean if you feel bad but not like i\'m in labor or gonna die pain couldn\'t you just drive yourself some of the times?          \ni would but i would feel even WORSE if something were to happen to my baby!!!! he shouldn\'t even care of feel cranky! my bf doesn\'t care what he\'s doing when I was pregant and told him i didn\'t feel well he\'d say lets go to the doctor rigth away and not that the baby is here he is RIGHT there if something is wrong with our baby even a cough get him really worried. so no don\'t feel bad it\'s his job          \nHe got you pregnant, he\'s the dad and you\'re his girlfriend.. Don\'t feel bad. In some cases he may think you\'re just being paranoid but so what..? If you can\'t breathe is not being paranoid it\'s an immediate concern.          ',

However every self employed contract I have been offered over the years has demanded one. No liability insurance then no contract.          \nIt probably is.  Most states require licensed contractors to carry both liability and workman's compensation insurance.  Lapse of insurance is cause for suspension of your license.  (You should know this if you are a licensed contractor.) \r\n \r\nIf you are signing a contract, and you agree to that clause, then you have legally agreed to carry the insurance.  Most boiler plate contracts require proof of insurance either before signing or before work begins, and further require that the insurance be kept in force throughout the term of the contract (no fair getting it one day, and cancelling the policy the next day.)          \nMost states require a contractor's license, liability insurance and (if you have any employees) workers' compensation insurance.          \nIt is not a legal requirement to have Public Liability - BUT it would be extremely dumb not have it though. However if anyone works for you directly, or indirectly in so far as you are legally responsible for them - then it is a legal requirement to have Employers Liability for them (and you won't get that without having PL for both you and your employee/s).

	{'answer': u"\nHere's the link to the website that has a list and description of all the extreme thrill rides, thrilling and fun rides, and young thrill rides such as Samurai, Vortex, Slammer, Detonator, No Way Out, Flying Fish, Time Voyagers, Colossus, Quantrum Carpet Ride, Nemesis Inferno, SAW The Ride, Tidal Wave, Rush, and more. Just click on the ride and it will give you a full description of what they are like. Hope this helps! Have fun at Thorpe Park tomorrow.          \nFirst and foremost; good luck! The park opened today for its main season, so tomorrow could be crowded; you've been warned! \r\n \r\nTry to get Saw: The Ride and Stealth in first cos they attract the biggest queues! (well I wouldn't know about Saw because it opened today, but since it's new I'd imagine there would be a huge queue for it). \r\n \r\nMy recommendations all depend on what kind of rides you prefer; if you like thrilling rides then, as well as Saw and Stealth, try to get on Slammer, Samurai, Detonator, Vortex, Zodiac, Nemesis Inferno and Colossus. \r\nCheck out this site for pics and ratings of the rides; \r\n \r\n \r\nHave fun :) \r\n \r\nEDIT: \r\n \r\nAww you're joking! Those rides ain't open?? That's not a good start to the main season is it! Sorry to hear that :( \r\nHave fun nonetheless! \r\n \r\nSince Stealth and Saw are currently unavailable then Nemesis Inferno and Colossus will have the longest queues most probably, get them in first instead!          \ni havent been on saw the ride yet but i cant wait  \r\nand stealth and slammer are also really good shame theyre closed.. \r\nrush is really fun but u feel like ur going to fall off \r\ncolussus and nemesism are good \r\nvortex is good \r\ndont go on x no way out its not good \r\nand detonator is amazing! \r\n \r\nand get the priority passes, they cut the line SO much but u get death stares from the people in the normal lines!! \r\nhave fun!

	{'answer': u"\nYes but with eveidence          \nI don't see why not, you have solid evidence. But court and solicitor's fee would eventually be worth much more than the phone itself. you have to ask yourself if it is financially worth the hassle. Good luck.          \nThe court costs would be more than the phone.  While you can also sue for the costs to be covered by him, you would have to win the case AND it's up to you to get the money.  Just because the court rules in your favor, they will not force him to pay for either the phone or the fees.  That will be up to you.  It's better to just buy a new phone and let the police charge him with theft.          \nI would not try its pointless. He would have sold the other phone within 20 mins or is holding onto it. Get your network to bar the phones and then get a new one with insurance which can be as cheap as 60 for an iphone and learn a lesson.  \r\n \r\nYou could start a case against him but would you want this thug knowing your name? That could open you up espeacially if they are in your city etc and with things like facebook etc          \nFirst of all, I assume he is being charged criminally with the theft. If so the judge can make him reimburse the victim (you), as part of sentencing.  \r\n \r\nIf not, take him to small claims court -you don't need an attorney for that. Yep, you'll have to pay the filing fee and you should get that back depending on your state. You'll win but actually getting him to pay the judgment may not be easy, but sue him anyway.          \nRegarding the CCTV footage....  \r\n \r\nMake sure it is watermarked! courts will only accept it then. without a watermark they have no idea if the footage has been tampered with and will not allow it          ",

	{'answer': u"\nit might be expenise aslo the parking there can be tight \r\nand on red flag day(days wheere there is  chance of  a brush fire0 there is no parking allowed (they do that so the fire engines can get though) \r\nso you could find your vehile towed \r\nso it depends on your bugdet of course          \nIf you can afford it.....go for it          \nIt's on the expensive side (commonly $1300 - $2000 one bedroom) and not all that safe. I mean, it's OK, but you might be surprised that you're paying that much for the area. Supply and demand. Keep alert and get great locks on your apt and a car alarm and you'll be fine. Parking sucks. Beachwood Dr is the big street that goes up in to the hills with lots of apt buildings. To be in the Hollywood HIlls you'll want a place above Franklin Ave. Then west from about La Brea Ave along Hollywood and Franklin Ave there are also many apts. \r\n \r\nIf that's the kind of environment you want, you might also try Los Feliz - east from Western Ave, around Hollywood Bl, Franklin Ave, Los Feliz Bl, Silverlake, and West Hollywood. All of those places have sketchy and nice areas and a variety of apts.  \r\n \r\nIf you go to the east, there is Glendale, Eagle Rock, Altadena and Pasadena. Lots of apts and areas similar to the Hollywood Hills.  \r\n \r\nWest of West Hollywood is going to be very expensive for decent areas. \r\n \r\nThey will run a credit check on you before renting and some places are very persnickity. You can't pay months in advance to make up for bad credit. \r\n \r\nSafety Info:           \nHollywood Hills has some extremely expensive apartments, and it's rich/wealty celebrity territory.  More than $1500 a month for rent, I believe.  The problem is that the housing is located in the high hills of Los Angeles (hence the name of the area) and so the mansions and nice apartments there are prone to strong brushfires.  A lot of celebrities suffer, but you know their lives can't always be easy. \r\n \r\nIf you can find anything affordable, go for it, because Hollywood Hills is a safe area.  However, please note California has a 12%+ unemployment rate, higher than the national average of 9.1%.  And although it may seem that Los Angeles is a rich city, it is not.  Much of the area is impoverished is constantly being raided by illegal immigrants trying to look for a job in a financially-troubled state.  Right now the 3 richest counties in the United States are Loudoun County, Virginia; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Howard County, Maryland, all located in the Washington, D.C. area, which has a below-average unemployment rate, only 6%.  Tax rate in California is 8%, as opposed to the nation's capital area, with only 5%. \r\n \r\nEach year, California also has to experience natural disasters.  Mudslides during late-winter and spring, earthquakes all-year around, and wildfires all-year around, and flash floods during the summer.  Sounds great, huh?          \nAnd you are coming here on what visa??? \r\n \r\nAnd where are the jobs you have previously lined up? \r\n \r\nOr are you independently wealthy? \r\n \r\nBecause you cannot just move here. And you will be unable to find a job here without an engineering degree at this time. \r\n \r\nPlus, the Hollywood Hills is one of the more expensive areas to live. \r\n \r\nAs well, you cannot rent in California without passing a US credt check.          \nI hope this is for a holiday and not permanent you're asking.

	{'answer': u'\nNo; roller coasters aren\'t scary. Stop being a "whoo" and man up.          \nOnly the first time. Colossus was the first roller coaster i ever went on. I was terrified when i was in the queue and going up, but once the ride actually started it wasn\'t scary at all, super fun! The first time i went on saw i was almost crying with fear, but the guy sitting next to me (not my brother, the stranger on the other side) was really nice and supportive, he said he\'d been on it before and it was not that scary, he was right! The first time i went on stealth i was quite nervous but not as bad as with saw, i found all the roller coasters to be fun and less scary than the anticipation i felt waiting in the queue! Though it took me three goes before i would put my hands in the air for saw\'s big drop! I haven\'t been on swarm but i imagine that it\'s not as scary as saw. I would advise you to try colossus (least scary) and if you don\'t enjoy it don\'t go on any scarier ones, if you get scared in the queue like i did then just tell yourself that the ride itself doesn\'t last all that long, and that you don\'t have to do it again if you don\'t want to but it\'s worth feeling a little scared now because you might really enjoy it like i did, and whether you enjoy it or not you can buy yourself a medal afterward!

	{'answer': u'\nSex is not for kids - simple as that really.          \nHaving sex at 13 is not a very good idea. Just take a moment and think it. Ask yourself, what would happen if I got this girl pregnant. How would both of your parents react to this. Where would you get the money to take care of the child. Honestly I think it\'s just a bit too much responsibility for people our age.          \nBad Idea. I\'m 13 myself and I would go further than making out, Holding Hands, or even cuddling.  \r\nI wouldn\'t even be that stupid to give head! Take it from another 13 year old. IT\'S WRONG! You will get her pregnant especially without protection and then you\'re stuck trying to take care of a baby that you don\'t even have money for!  \r\n \r\nI mean at 13 you should even be giving head, having sex, or even fingering. Just don\'t.          \nTerrible idea. No matter how you feel emotionally or physically, 13 is too young. What if you got her pregnant? Or contracted an std? Can you imagine trying to support a child when you\'re in middle school? Or getting an incurable std that you have to deal with for the rest of your life? Wait, it\'ll be that much better when you do.          \nI would say bad because your first time is supposed to be special. You will always want to remember it . Do you really think it will be special at thirteen? Imagine yourself twenty years from now. Will you end up regretting it? Also, the younger you do it the longer more you have to worry about STDs or getting anyone pregnant. If you do decide to do it please use protection.          \nMy son ! Really 13? You beat me, My first time was 14. \r\n \r\nOther than that its up to you honestly ignore what people say.  \r\nThey say its a bad idea to me I dont care. \r\nIts just you and your mate\'s hormones  \r\nGo for it little man !          \nIf she gave you that, you already had some kind of sexual relations, and it\'s still considered sex. And no. Your 13 years old and your nowhere near getting married, absolutely not. You two doing this now shows irresponsibility. Are you going to take care of a baby if she gets pregnant, or are you going to have her get an abortion, or run like most men do? If you know your not ready, I suggest you do not engage any further then what you and this girl already have done. Sex is not a new game you play or a joke. It\'s serious business. And if your not prepared, somebody is bound to get hurt for real. You need to save sex for marriage and take your time getting to know this girl, if she is your girlfriend. And at this point, a boy your age should not be having a girlfriend this young, and needs to focus on getting to a good high school and apply to the college of your choice. When your ready to marry and be serious with a girl, is the time you date. You want to marry at 18, then date at 16 the most. In your 20\'s, 16 to whenever your ready. \r\n \r\nDon\'t date to fool around like your doing now. That\'s how you two will end up in heartbreak and the relationship is bound to fail. \r\n \r\nBest Regards          \nare you ready to have kids?          \nif your not ready to be a daddy you should wait  \r\nthink what it would be like if she got pregnant and what would happen with her and your family          \nI lost it at 14 and it felt amazing,so yeah go ahead,just use a condom and dont forget foreplay! \r\nand this may help: \r\n          \nawful idea, wait for marriage          \nThis is a subject brought up very often here. Because of society and the standards of today 13 is still considered a child. Most if not all are still in school.  Today 13 is considered too young to be having intercourse. In most states it is below the age of consent. \r\n \r\nAbout 100 to 150 years ago and for thousands of years before (different society and different standards) many girls were married by age 13 and most were pregnant or had children by age 14. Indeed the mother of Jesus the Christ, Mary, was between 12 and  13 when she was made pregnant by the Lord God and between 13 and 14 when she delivered. \r\n \r\nHaving sex at 13 may not be the best idea but that does not mean you should totally refrain either. Just be prepared for the out come. At 13 you are very fertile and can get pregnant easily. Be absolutely sure you are on a good birth control. Always practice safe sex to lower the chances of STDs. DON\'T have intercourse until you are ready and consensual to having sex. Don\'t let some boy talk you into having sex. Many young guys just want to score with as many girls as they can and could care less about the feelings of her. \r\n \r\nAbstinence is not the best route either. It has been proven over and over the so called "Abstinence pledges" cause more problems than not. In many cases waiting until marriage to have sex can cause more divorces mainly due to adultery or cheating. Also STDs are higher among those who are abstinent . \r\n \r\nSo what is the right age to have sex and intercourse? This has to be decided by you, your knowledge of the matter, and that you are not being forced into it. Are you ready for it or are you just curious. Weigh all the factors I have given here and anymore you can think of. Learn all you can first and don\'t be sorry later.          \nA wise man once said and I quote  \r\n"Don\'t have sex. Cause you will get pregnant, and die." \r\nDon\'t do that to her man. Don\'t be a killer.          \nbad idea plenty of time for risk of disease and babies later          \nFrom the viewpoint of a 13 year old, ANY form of sexual relief is wonderful. HOWEVER, the truth is that at 13 YOUR body is not finished growing and developing into an adult and won\'t be for at least 5 or more years.  The only CONSTANT thing in the life of a teenager is CHANGE.  From music, food, clothes, friends and a million other things, you will be undergoing CHANGE each and every day. Your very body itself is constantly changing during puberty to adolescence. So, good or bad idea? One of the absolute worst things you could do at this age.  \r\n \r\nFrankly, at 13 you could not possibly know all the facts required for you and your girlfriend at this time before she changes like everything else in your life. \r\n \r\nThe very best advice I can give you is for the two of you to pet, fondle, kiss, cuddle and/or massage each other to the point of masturbating one another.  In other words accept the fact that 95% of teens, male and female, masturbate.  The other 5% are liars!  So, accept the fact that masturbation is natural and necessary in order to relieve yourself and learn what turns you on vs. what does not.  \r\n \r\nSpend some time along, with a nice body old and massage each other naked.  Use your hands, tongue, fingers and mouth to cause the other to masturbate.  If it involves her giving you a slow, steady, quality blow  job while you lick and finger her vagina (Also known as a 69er" then go for it.  \r\nIf it means actually having penetration by you into her vagina with your penis the answer is NO! \r\n \r\nThe other answers are good but lack the down to earth reasons.  You are far to old to become parents.  Your bodies are still growing, let them develop.Keep your sexual activity to a decided set of reliefs. To get good head, have her run  her tongue around the head of your penis. Then have her hold  the base of your penis with one hand and with the opposite hand have her massage your balls. \r\nThis will get you squirming and tossing and ultimate you will ejaculate.  Make sure she goes deeper and deeper with each stroke, taking more penis into her mouth with each stroke. Ask her to accept all your ejaculate into her mouth and to spit or swallow it when she has finisheed.  Then back to the massage to get every drop out of his body.  AVOID "Babies having babies. \r\n \r\nWait until you are at least 18 and able to really pleasure a woman (not a little girl). When you wait to 18 each minimum you will better understand that actual intercourse requires skill and patience. \r\nBetween now and then, practice masturbating to the point of ALMOST and then STOP. Let things settle and start again but when you get to ALMOST again, STOP again and let things settle. \r\nAfter 3 or 4 sessions like this, keep stroking until you ejaculate every drop. THIS prepares you for intercourse when you will gently slide your penis into her vagina a little at a time until it is all the way into her at which point you will "pop her cherry" which simply means your penis will penetrate through her hymen barrier causing her to bleed and to experience pain. \r\n \r\nI hope you find this not only interesting and informative but your best answer. Last and most important, NEVER have sexual relations with a female unless you are wearing a good quality condom.  No Exceptions  Ever!

	{'answer': u'\ndo as much stuff as possible yourself!!! shop around, dont buy the first stuff you see.          \nwe did ours for less than 3000.  \r\ntry to keep guest numbers down. \r\nshop around for a venue. doesnt have to be all posh n fancy to be nice. our evening do was just at a nice country pub.  \r\nwe had a family member who has a really good camera to do the photos. \r\nwe didnt have flowers cos we both hate them. but fake flowers are much cheaper and you can keep them. \r\nfamily member made the cake. \r\nborrowed the wedding cars off someone the brides dad knew. \r\nbride made her own dress. (or search net vigarouly for bargins). \r\navoid wedding shops for decorations cos they are stoopidly expensive. a lot of normal high street shops or the internet are just as good. \r\nwe made the invitations ourselves. it is very simple to make your own on standard computer software and get them printed by a local printing shop if not by yourself.          \nElope.          \nDear one \r\n \r\nCongratulations on your upcoming nuptials. \r\n \r\nBudgets are hard to deal with, no fun at all. Here are some tips, however. \r\n \r\nFool yourself. Mentally set a 3,000 pound budget and keep the remaining 2,000 in the bank for overages (there will always be overages). \r\n \r\nWith due respect to the Royals, ignore all the hype and such the media will stir into the mix. Turn off those silly "reality" shows about this wedding or that bridezilla. Truly, you are not going to allow yourself to become a bridezilla and the Loch Ness Monster is more real than those "reality" shows are. That means you don\'t need to release live trout into the wild, reforest Spain, or some other silly "need." You don\'t need all that stuff. \r\n \r\nWith that in mind, learn the art of compromise. Pick your battles carefully. That means if your future MIL desperately wants you to wear the veil that she wore in her wedding - how about it? It could be the "something borrowed" or "something old" part - and will go miles and miles towards earning good points as a woman deserving of her son.  Same thing for all kinds of "details" in your wedding. Let others make decisions (within your budget of course - and let it be known that you have a very limited amount of money to spend). But if your sister or grandmother desperately want blue cornflowers on the tables - hey, that\'s fine as long as they\'re not blowing your money away. \r\n \r\nOne poster suggested that you do a lot of work yourself. Baloney. You will be too busy being the bride to fold won-tons or cut out cookies - but that could be a great way to invite your various and future family members into your life - hold a stuffed cabbage party - with everyone making stuffed cabbage leaves for the wedding buffet. \r\n \r\nNow there\'s a limit to accepting favors. If a family/friend wants to bake your cake - but has no experience with wedding cakes - or baking at all unless from a mix, perhaps that might be a favor passed over - but if he or she is famous for smoked salmon or some other delicacy, perhaps they would be willing to produce that instead. \r\n \r\nFinally, yes William and Kate\'s wedding will be attended by hundreds at the reception ball; but you just want your closest friends and family around you. Keep the guest list down to 25 or less and make it clear to those who would surprise you with additional attendees, that they will be monetarily responsible for the extra guests. That is the only rule where you have little choice but to be adamant if you want to keep within your budget. OF course, since you have made your budget public knowledge (within your families) then your family members are well aware of the limited funds under which you are operating. Therefore, Great Aunt Cecilia who lives 200 km away and who hasn\'t seen, spoken or corresponded with you since you were five - may just have to miss this one. \r\n \r\nGood luck honey.          \nI kept my wedding under 5,000 dollars \r\n \r\nThere are a few things I did \r\nThe dress, I paid 250 dollars for the dress \r\nIt was not the dress I would pick if I had all the money, but it was pretty, the best dress for the price I could paid \r\nflowers, I did single red with a pink ribbon for the bouquet for the bridesmaid and MOH \r\nSingle flower will be a lot less, you may do it yourself.  I had a friend that bought Calla Lillies and did three with a ribbon she tied herself.  This save a lot of money \r\nFlowers is a huge saving if you do in season flowers.  The problem with May, is Mother\'s Day, if your wedding is the first two weeks,  you will pay more for flowers \r\nYou do simple in season flowers,  you will save a lot \r\n \r\nCenter pieces, I used the ones that came with the venue \r\nThere were not fancy, maybe not really, I do not remember, but that is an area I saved money \r\n \r\nI had a photographer for the wedding and an hour extra.  Not having it the whole day, saved more than half \r\nThis was a way I saved money \r\n \r\nInvitation, I saved money \r\n \r\nWe had our wedding on a friday, knowing a lot of our friends and family could not make a Friday night wedding because they lived more than a few hours away and work.  I like the friday night weddings \r\nI know some areas of the US give discounts on Friday and Sunday weddings.  Not were I live, not sure if that is true in the UK.  That is something to look at.  If any day is cheaper than another day \r\n \r\nWe used an DJ, much cheaper than a Band \r\nSome people use Ipod and have people running the music \r\n \r\nThe biggest expense in most weddings are reception(venue and food) and dress \r\nIF you could do venue for under 3,000, if you are very careful with everything else you could do it for under five.  The less you could do the reception for, the better \r\n \r\nCake is another area \r\nI have know people that have someone that can bake bake the cake \r\nSome do if as a gift other for cost \r\nDo you have someone who could make a cake?  Not everyone does, if you do, that could be a huge savings \r\n \r\n \r\nI had a wonderful wedding I could afford \r\nIt was not the wedding I would of had if I had a lot of money \r\nThere is nothing wrong with cutting out things or doing the cheap          \nBest way is to keep the guest list small. We spent the most money on guests; we wanted nice food and drinks, and per person it ended up at about $100.  \r\n \r\nOther ways to save money: \r\n \r\n1. Buy flowers wholesale and do your own bouquets. \r\n2. Go with a DJ instead of a band. Or, better yet, have an iPod DJ if you can get speakers. Downside to this is that you won\'t have a master of ceremonies announcing everything, but you could ask a friend or relative to do it. \r\n3.On that note, enlist talented friends and relatives to perform specific tasks, and give them tips instead of payment. Know anyone who is a good photographer? Has a good taste in music? Can sew? Bake a beautiful cake?  \r\n4. If you want a more professional touch, post on Craigslist or a similar site. We found a photographer who was just starting her business, so she charged about half as much as the other pros in our area, but the quality was just as good. \r\n5. Design a budget. You can find samples online that can give you percentage estimates based on your total budget. Build in a cushion. We spent about $2k more on our wedding than we expected on our $10k wedding because we had more people RSVP yes than we expected.          \ndont get married spend the money on the house          \nwrite your own invitations, get a friend to do the photos (one who is good with a camera of course). Choose your venue carefully, don\'t invite too many people, just the ones you really want to have there-its your day remember.          \nFirst let me say that 5000 is a good budget to have a nice wedding.  I am planning a wedding for June 2011 and I will say that keeping the guests list helps a lot.  It is expensive to feed 200 people LOL.  But anyway, I would write a list of things that you just have to have for your wedding and then things that you can do without. Dont choose the first thing that you see, shop around for venues and it helps to find somewhere that would let you have the wedding and reception in the same place.  I agree with doing alot of things yourself helps.  Use alot of your resources that you know would help you with the wedding. Good luck!!!          \nCongrats on your wedding \r\n \r\nCall in your family and friends to help out \r\nYou could have a family meal and then invite friends to the party afterwards \r\nGet family/friends to do your flowers (grow them in advance for seasoning in May) and make your cake \r\nBuy your bridesmaid dresses in the january sales \r\nGet the lend of a friends snazzy car instead of hiring one \r\nKeep your bridal party numbers low so you don\'t have to pay too much for suits/dresses \r\nOxfam have a bridal department that does cheap dresses \r\nUse church candles with labels rather than personalised fancy ones \r\nBuy your invitations in the local stationary shop (they might do you a deal) \r\nSee if you can get less options for the courses of the meal and try for a package deal with your reception \r\nYou could hire a band that covers both traditional and disco music \r\nYou could buy boxes of sweets and pop them on plates with a thank you note as wedding favours          \nThe best way to keep a wedding under budget is to trim the guest list. The reception takes up the majority of your money. Consider something like a back yard reception or at a church hall. Shop around for everything such as the dress, flowers, etc. Try to find decorations in the dollar store and flowers and cake at the supermarket. Do you own invitations and thank you cards. If all else fails, consider the courthouse. You will emerge as married as anyone. Best wishes!          \ncongratulations! i\'m getting married in april 2011. i have a friend making my cake, another friend helped pay for my dress because she doesn\'t know what to give for a present and she thought that would be thoughtful. i got my reception/food for a thousand pounds, wanted a church but settled for registry office. think of alternatives to cars. my local taxi firm will do it for \xa390. the rag and bone man for \xa3100. buy the bridesmaids normal dresses that they can wear again and that no one will have a fit if they get dirty. a friend is doing the photo\'s but you could get a professional to just do a few and then put disposable cameras on the tables at reception so guests can take snaps. these are more relaxed natural shots than a professional would take. we are older and have everything we need. we already have two toasters etc! we have made up a little poem asking guests to make an anonymous donation to help pay for our honeymoon instead.          \nDO It Yourself is the way to go to keep your budget low. I\'ve included links to Martha Stewart, who has some awesome projects from floral arrangements to favors. And if you do DIY projects you can have a party were you, your bridesmaids, mother and mother in law can do these projects together. \r\n \r\nInvitations:  \r\nMichael\'s-- \r\n \r\nParty City-- \r\n \r\nJoann\'s-- \r\n \r\nWalmart-- \r\n__________________ \r\nMartha Stewart: \r\n \r\nCenterpieces-- \r\nBoutonnieres & corsages-- \r\nBouquets-- \r\nCeremony Decor--          \nLots of items you can save money on, bake a cake, friends and family can cook something everyone can bring some wine. \r\nAs Polly states a friend with a good camera is not enough even a student will lack the skills needed here. \r\nAn experienced wedding photographer provides much more than quality photographs, but will be good dealing with people and able to capture real emotions quickly. A professional photographer will plan every aspect of your wedding day so that you can relax and enjoy meeting family and friends. If the weather takes a turn for the worst and your event moves indoors, a great deal of skill is required to create light that is flattering and creative. \r\nYour photographs are an investment and one of the few things that last well beyond your wedding day.

	{'answer': u"\nyeah that is bad.. are you a ****?          \nIf je's 21 then that's technically a rape O: \r\nWOW. THis is not good... you need to talk to someone now...          \nYES! get some standards girl! \r\n \r\nand report that pedo  while you're at it          \nEw. You're 13. You shouldn't even be thinking about sex. You should be playing with your girl friends and pretending you're Hannah Montana. But whatever, it's your choice of potentially having an STD or a KID for the rest of your life.          \nYea sorry you do. Having sex at that age can really mess up your childhood, and he was obviously using you for sex. Its ok for guys to have physical attractiont to you, but evidently you let your hormones get the best of you. You have no idea what you have lost until you get older, and that guy could of had an STD or gotten you pregnant. He could go to jail to.          \numm honey i really dont kno for sure if all this is true but anyways your 13 you sould not be doing anything like that your just a kid...and if uve already started your period then you could get pregnant at a young age and if ur tiny then you could kill ur self and the baby or you could get real sick....so just ignore the guys...im 15 and ive been asked b4 too and touched etc etc...just tell them no and walk away and if they dont stop then you need to tell some one...your way to young to have that stuff happening to you.          \nYou need to stop having sex. And you need to tell the guys who are touching you to stop. or tell your a teacher that they are dong it. \r\n \r\nSex is not something you do with people you like at your age. Sex can really mess up your development. So yes. You could have a problem if you dont stop having sex. Guys are not supposed to be touching you. that is sexual harassment. \r\n \r\nAnd the guy who had sex with you could and should go to jail, because having sex with a 13 year old is illegal and classified as rape, because 13 year olds have no consent. \r\n \r\nGood luck. I hope you make the right decisions.          \nif you have sex with him thats basicly illegal he can arrested for that and you can get into a heep of trouble too. \r\n \r\ni think its ******** pathetic when guys that are older than 20 fucckkin around with girls that are between 12-17  \r\n \r\nget a girl your own age          \nthat's rape.          \nI had sex when i was 13 and she was 12.  Use condoms. You can do whatever makes you happy.          \nJAIL BAIT! \r\ndon't put your information on the internet, little girl. \r\nnow the police are probably looking for your brothers friend. \r\nstatutory rape much? \r\nlmao \r\nbut do you not see the problem with him being 21 and you being 13?          \nYou can im me if you would like to talk          ",

	{'answer': u"\nIt sounds like you were mis-sold the insurance.  You should contact A&L in the first instance, tell them what happened, and ask for the policy to be cancelled and the premiums refunded.  If you don't have any luck with them, you can pursue the case with the Financial Ombudsman.          \nNo you don't, payment protection can sometimes be worth having but it's usually way overpriced and unnecessary; it's like when they try to sell you extended warranties on electrical goods.          \nYour independent financial advisor is right. There is no need to take any form of payment protection insurance at all. In fact the Office of Fair Trading are considering banning the practice of selling insurance with loans, precisely because people are persuaded to buy something that they don't need and is probably overpriced.          \nYou have been misled. The payment protection is usually non-negotiable, because it means if you default on the loan, the bank will be able to get their money back. However, if you have proof of insurance covering that loan from anywhere else, you can argue that the loan is covered even though it is not their own insurance policy. \r\nIf you do not have any payment protection insurance at all, the bank can reasonably refuse you the loan.          \nI found a good atricle relating to this on moneysavingexpert, and tells how to claim it back, hope it helps: \r\n          ",

I had thought nothing of it and just paid it. However, I had a meeting with an Independant Financial Advisor yesterday on a completely different subject and the loan did arise in conversation. She said it was nonsense that I HAD to take out this cover with them, and said I could cover both my mortgage and loan for roughly 20% of what I pay for the loan on its own if I use an Independant Insurance company. \r\n \r\nCan anybody shed some light on this matter, because I have been given two contrasting pieces of information from two 'reliable' sources and don't really know where i stand..... \r\n \r\nMany thanks in advance  ",

	 'question': u"\n    So, when I was younger I spent three months over the summer living with my father in LA, California. I have gone countless times and it is my favorite city by far (I've been to NY, lived in Chicago, Houston,) Travel a lot. I'm curious at what I need to do to move ASAP after I turn 18. I want to go to USC there. I'm 14 and in all honors and take part in a special program for film and tv editing (I actually skipped 163 and 263 (low class levels, so I will be producing a short film junior/senior year)  but I am also good in other subjects. (All honors) My thought is to attempt a double major, one in what I enjoy (film production, the other in something more practical like math, and use that as a back up plan) Advice on making my dream come true? Oh and by the way I am very aware of how LA isn't all pretty, and I'm prepared for that. I need to get away from my parents who are abusive and sexist and LA happens to be a city I love. I realize the extreme cost of living.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nset is a collection of objects obeying a common rule. from what you are saying they cannnot be clubbed into a single set.. \r\n \r\nmy opinion they cannot be in the same set but can belong to different sets like \r\n \r\nA = { set of alphabets of english} \r\nB= { set of natural numbers } \r\n \r\nand so on..          \nA set containing numbers and letters of the alphabet could be a set of SYMBOLS. \r\n \r\nA set containing humans and animals could be a set of LIVING THINGS. \r\n \r\nFor as long as you could name the CATEGORY for all the elements in a set, then they could be considered as belonging to that CATEGORY or SET.          \nYes as living beings you can combine humans and animals in a set.          \nYour question is a good one, though also somewhat subtle if examined in depth. \r\n \r\nOn the surface, the answer is yes, different objects can be combined in a set.  For example, you can have a set containing matrices, rational numbers, polygons, polynomials all in one set. \r\n \r\nHowever, almost every mathematical object can be built up from sets based on the rules of axiomatic set theory.  Numbers, matrices, points, lines can all be defined as sets, or sets of sets, or sets of sets of sets, etc.  In other words when being very rigorous and precise, there is only one "kind" of object ... namely a sets.  So sets are only allowed to contain "nothing" or to contain other sets as elements. \r\n \r\nIn truth, it can get even more complicated than that and sometimes sets can get too large (the "set" of all sets) and mathematicians forbid such "large" sets from being defined as sets because they lead to paradoxes. \r\n \r\nSo from a strictly mathematical viewpoint, you won\'t find presidents and dishwashers in sets (although you can have different kinds of mathematical objects as these can all be built up from sets), although if you step outside of the strictly mathematical realm, it is certainly permissible to mix and match non-mathematical objects and mathematical objects within sets.          \nyes          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I am confused about the elements of a set. Some people say we can\u2019t combine different categories like numbers and alphabets or humans with animals. I have seen a set in the book which have both numbers and alphabets. However I have also read in a book that elements of a set must distinct but of same kind. If the fist one is right then how will we write such a set in the descriptive method. If the 2nd idea is right then how will we make a union of different categories of a set .will we make a union of different categories of a set.  ',

Has she seen her doctor about this Paranoia.          \nParanoia.  \r\n \r\nI'm the same way.          \nWow--she sounds rather schizoid!  I would be honest with her and tell her your feelings.  Do you think she would benefit from some type of counseling-if so recommend it to her.  Don't end your friendship because of her sickness--you need to try and help her!          \nPersonally it sounds to me like she just has a very low self esteem.  She feels very inadequate and is afraid that everyone around her is going to see that inadequacy.  If you were ever a really good friend to her you might try and help her out.  Get her a good self esteem book and try and be supportive but be honest with her and tell her that her neediness is pushing you away. \r\n \r\n \r\nthis might be a good place to start looking, good luck.          \nOk, you are just a little too obsessed with this friend.

You need to step up and tell her something to boost her confidence. It's really sad how we are obsessed with what other people think.  \r\n \r\nGood Luck          \nYes, it sounds like a social phobia, and she also sound co-dependent. As she looks to you to confirm her anxieties.  \r\nHave you tried telling her in personal exactly what you have written here? Half of the healing, is knowing. It sounds like you honestly care about her, before ending the relationship at least try.. \r\nShe is afraid people are talking about her, and your afraid to talk... sounds like a pair :)  but....that's what friends are for, to be honest and to try to help each other.  \r\n \r\nSuzan          \nI know how you feel,it is really very draining to have a friend like that,stay away from her for a while.

	{'answer': u"\nyeah, your cc bills have nothing to do with your house.            \nForget the lecture of Ends Meet. You need to move to where you can afford to live.           \nYes, if you file bankruptcy, you can keep your house - in most cases. Contact an attorney or legal aide office (most attorneys have a free initial consultation). \r\n \r\nPersonally, I would let the credit cards go. Pay the house and lights/gas/telephone. The worst that will happen is that you'll get alot of harassing phone calls...which will stop when you file bankruptcy. The bankruptcy will also stop the creditors from seeking getting paid through garnishing your husband's pay or your bank account. \r\n \r\nGood luck - bankruptcy is not the end of the road. It just might be a beginning for you.           \nyes but if you are not able to be discharged in court from these bills then the cc companies can sue you and get a judgment and then attach liens that would at some point have to be paid. You need to see an atty who specialty is BK 7 and reaffirming on the home mortgage           \nIf you default on your credit cards, you will eventually lose your house. I would look to downsize and use the money to pay off the credit cards. Better to live in a smaller house than lose everything.           \nChapter 7 bankruptcy allows you to keep your home while erasing your unsecured debt. However--you must meet income and debt tests now--it's not as simple as it used to be. Your assets will be counted, and that will include your home, and your income will be counted--all the jobs.  \r\n \r\nHave you tried credit counseling first? The firms who do credit counseling are really good these days, and they can help you get a plan to pay down your debts without bankruptcy. Since you're up to date on your mortgage, you should be able to do a chapter 13 which reorganizes your debts and allows you to actually pay them off--without touching your house.  \r\n \r\nTry this firm: CCCS.

If you do have sex, which is probably a bad idea, then use protection.          \nOhhh boo hoo! \r\nYour 13 and think you need to have sex? ****.. \r\nEven you say you know you can't have a baby....then guess what you should do? \r\nDON'T HAVE SEX SMART ***!          \nEven if this is a joke I went throught this, not kidding, I wasn't seriously obsessed but u was getting so curious and horny! Its normal, masturbating is for this sort of urge, that's normal aswell, do it! Its fine!          \nOkay, first, I would calm doen a lityle, I understand and all. But \r\n Maybe try masturbating? :D just my two cents I'm not real educated but.          \nmasturbate and all your problems will go away.          \nYou posted this earlier -___-          \nAll you can do right now is masturbate. That is your only option for a few years.  Or go bang some random dude. I guarantee if you walked up to any boy your age and asked he would say yes. Not recommending this though.          \nGirl, its OK-puberty sucks and it is not an easy place to be. Try focusing on self esteem building skills. Find something that you are interested in and excel at that -the urge to have sex can be strong at your age d/t puberty and if you have bad feelings about yourself the urge is intensified. u are not wrong and self berating yourself only makes this harder. Talk to a councilor , or clergy or someone who you feel you can trust, you need good strong advise from a professional. Try to get involved with your peers , at church or community functions, etc.Be trust worthy because once you break your parents trust you can never fully regain it. Try sports, exercise and there is no shame in masterbation.It is an excellent stress reliever and natural at your age. Being sexually  active is NOT natural for some one of your age..Good luck always          \nMasturbate duh -.-          ",

	{'answer': u'\nif this is going to be a right decision you should make sure you have a job lined up and stake out nieghborhoods before you move down there.  oh and one more tip get a makeover.  the people that live in lowa and Los Angeles appear differently.          \nLos Angeles is a HUGE, crowded, and VERY expensive place to live in. Please do yourself a favor, and come out here for a week or so to look around and see for yourself what the housing costs are, what the job market is like, what the different areas are like, what the general everyday expenses will be, etc. before you commit yourself to moving here.  \r\n \r\nMany people who move here sight unseen are pleased and decide to stay, but there are also some who are disappointed and now must spend even more money (if they have any left) to go somewhere else.  \r\n \r\nAre you making the right decision? Please take my suggestion so you can be better informed to decide for yourself.          \nCompared to Iowa prices of housing, you will probably experience sticker shock. Go to ForRent.com and try searching there for something in your price range. As for the people, you\'re going to find that, just like you,  alot of people are from somewhere else. You\'ll get the people who try to fit into what they think is the LA scene, and you\'ll get the LA bashers who regret moving here. But mostly everyone is doing like people do elsewhere - get up, work and plan your weekends.          \nAre you making the right decision?  I would say NO!  If you are unhappy in IOWA, I guarantee that you will be unhappy anywhere else & everywhere else that you decide to go in the world.  I have live in Los Angeles MOST of my life & I have lived in California ALL of the life.  I have seen so many people from small "farm towns" end up in the streets of L.A. & living in shelters after they sustained bodily harm from being beaten & mugged by the seasoned PRO\'s who come to Los Angeles to prey on young men & women who are from other states.  If you don\'t know much about how the world works, then Los Angeles isn\'t for you.  You could end up another statistic & be added to the long list of Jane Doe\'s who are still waiting for their body parts to be claimed & identified by someone from somewhere!  You have NO IDEA what you are about to do.  It is NEVER a safe place for anyone who is alone.  Your body parts alone are worth over $250,000 as a donor (card id or not) to the medical people.  This town is FULL of sicko\'s.  I urge you to seek some therapy & get your life on a better track before you unknowingly & unwittingly commit suicide.  If you enjoy the flesh trade, then you will fit right in.  Don\'t go to the clubs, because that is where they put GHB in your drink & take you out to their car to transport you for photo sessions & sexual exploitation.  You think I am kidding?  These people are also running legitimate & successful businesses that will hire you, help you, then help themselves to what they think is their "property"...you!  It happens to men & women.  Consider yourself warned.  The Salvation Army has a program that will pay your bus fare back to your hometown when you have had enough of Los Angeles.  All you need is a friend or relative with a valid telephone number in the town where you want to go back to & they make the call & arrange your transportation.          \nWe\'re already packed with people, please stay in Iowa.          \nwhen u come here u should go to downtown LA and you\'ll b happy like me!!! \r\nyay \r\n:}          \nIts expensive. Get a job before you moved. \r\nOkay here goes The cheapest city in LACITY is Watts, They are more afforable cities like Compton is next to Los Angeles. \r\nThe cheapest city is Compton. \r\nHere you could fing a new Town house for around 300,000 \r\nor a new house for around 470k yes 470k5bed4bathroom \r\n \r\nso i suggest you to rent if you could afford go ahead lol buy your house. \r\nWelcome to Los Angeles County          \nFirst, figure out exactly what it is that makes you unhappy now.  Don\'t expect that a change of scenery will magically make you happy.  Running away from your problems does not necessarily solve them.   \r\nIf you\'re determined to make the move, get a job first that pays well enough to live in a region with a higher cost of living.  It also helps if you have friends or family in a new area.  Since you know no one in LA, it might be pretty lonely there until you manage to make new friends. \r\nEvery region has its advantages and drawbacks. \r\nNo matter where you go, there you are.          \nHi,  Hawkeye! \r\nYou should have a job before you move here.  \r\nCount on everything being 40% more expensive (or more) than Iowa. The average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $1200 per month with an additional $1200 needed as a deposit.  \r\nIt was easy for me to make friends here. Try Long Beach, CA, it used to be called Iowa by the Sea. That\'s where I live and I like it quite a bit. I\'m within walking distance of bars, restaurants, the beach and shopping. I just walked down the street to the bars and met people because they recognized I was new. Nobody ever tried to take advantage of me and sell me for black market body parts, lol! Just be sure to look at places close to the beach like Bluff Park or Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights. LB can be really bad in parts as can all of LA and Orange County.    \r\nI\'m from another large city so there wasn\'t a culture shock for me.  \r\nThe job market is very tight here.  \r\nJust remember that even though you are moving to get out of IA because of your unhappiness, your problems will follow you here. Especially when you find out how expensive everything is. \r\nDo Not Believe Everything You See On TV About LA. \r\n \r\nI\'m not sure where Sherryn got her information, that\'s some of the most bizarre stuff I\'ve ever heard.          \nHappiness comes from within.  You won\'t find it by moving.  \r\n \r\nBut if you\'re young and have no obligations, then go for it.  Just don\'t burn your bridges.  Keep enough money to get back if you need to.  \r\n \r\nBe aware, with out a college degree or job skills, it\'s unlikely you will find a job that pays well.  Everything is really expensive here, and chances are you will struggle financially.   \r\n \r\nMaking friends may be difficult,too. \r\n \r\nGood luck.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nyeah, just select everything except the one part, and change to b/w \r\n or create two layers the background the color image, and another layer on top as the b/w, and then erase the bw layer where you want color          \ndo a gray scale here and then you have a color and a b&w and then open b&w and copy and paste what you want color even can be done in paint,  \r\n \r\n \r\nyou have to have pic online, many effects can be done here \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nthat don't do it for you then google image generator and shop for what you want instead of laboring in a program use a generator for the best professional effects \r\n \r\n \r\nto get a custom shape you have to do a little artwork sometimes when you do this magnify to work with each pixel is the best that I have found...          \nAnything is possible in Photoshop.. \r\n \r\nI think you don't know use of layers thats why you are asking this question. \r\n \r\nYou got to work on layers.. create new ones and then try to make the pic black in color          \nHers a link with instructions that I've used. \r\n          \nYes you have to use your tools to outline the part that you want to keep that color and use the color option to change it to black and white. \r\nJust go to YouTube and you can learn even more how to do this.          \nthe easiest way i have found is use the color replacer tool select black as your color than paint over all of it u can also use an over layer but i find color replacer to be the easiest          \nselect maque tool and select the particular part (on same picture layer) and press Ctrl+Shift+ I  this will make that area gray scale \r\nif u want to make b n white instead of ctrl+shft ..  \r\ngoto menu drop downs  Image --> Adjustments --> Threshold.. (in bottom ) set the correct value press ok  \r\nand u have that part b and w          \nYes!

	{'answer': u"\nYou need to freaking toughen up and stop cutting. What's the benefit of it? It's just plain stupid          \nim 14 did it for a few months then stopped on a dime. Why? I realised it didnt do sh*t for me. It didnt stop the bullies or the bull crap at home. I woke up one day and started thinking and i realised how dumb it is. I have a roof over my head and food on the table there was no need forthe sh*t i did. and theres no need for what your doing.   and the sleepover thing... just have you both sleep in the living room i guess idk          \nHere's an idea that helped my friend get over her cutting problem... what she did was put happy thoughts, quotes and memories in a jar. When she felt like cutting she pulled one out, and it made her so much happier. If you like music, try listening to happy music, or music that you like. That's a good way for me to calm myself down when I get angry. All you have to do is find a substitute, it's all about habits and all you need to do is find a new one.  \nFor your parents, I'm not so sure if this will be effective, but if I we're you I would say to my parents that I am trying to stop cutting and would appreciate their full support. Tell them you're not cutting for attention, and if you're confident enough tell them the reason why you are. Or perhaps tell another respected elder? Perhaps a grandma, uncle, teacher, anyone! Support is the greatest thing anyone can give you! \nAs for the sleepover, depending on how long it has been wait for a bit. Then ask your parents again. Say that you can sleep in different rooms, and they can even check on you two. Explain that nothing more will happen. You two can see each other in the day, the morning, and maybe text each other at night when you're in your separate rooms? \nAnd 'Youwill''s comment was quite harsh. Sure, there isn't any benefits and it's not the best thing to be doing, but you're not stupid. You've made a mistake, like any other human. You're attempting to correct that mistake, which I am incredibly proud of you for doing so. Good luck and you have my, and your friends, full support!          ",
	 'question': u"\n    As I said before I'm a thirteen year old boy, I've been cutting for a few months now, every day maybe, but only when there's a reason - I'm not dependent on it, but as much as I hate it, I rely on it when I'm sad or upset. It's always my parents who make me cut. I have a very special friend at school, she's amazing and I love her to bits! She's always there for me and supports me no matter what. She knows I cut and I want to stop for her! It makes her so upset and I can't see her like that.  \n \nI'm finding it so hard, my parents are very constricting with my social life but more about that later ...  \nThey don't care I cut, they've seen my arms and my wrists and I hear them talking about it, saying I only do it for attention which only makes me do it more!  \nI've talked to them about it - I've told them how they can help me but they still don't, what should I do?? \nRecently... This girl I told you about has been the biggest part of my life, and I want to be around her more than anyone:) she makes me happy - my family doesn't...  She came to stay last weekend over night, after days of arguing with my parents they finnaly let us sleep in the same room... But they found her in my bed in the morning - she had a nightmare! Because of this they won't let us sleep in the same room again, I find it disgusting they think something sexual would happen?! What should I say to them? How can I perswade them? Last time she slept over was the happiest day of my life :) \nI need your help!  ",

	{'answer': u'\nYou are very self-aware, that\'s a good start but you need professional help to overcome your issues. Please talk to a parent, a teacher, school counsellor or doctor and ask for help. \r\nIf you need to talk to someone right now, phone the Samaritans: 08457 90 90 90 \r\nGood luck.          \nSweetheart your best friend should know better than any stranger online. She\'s right! people like you! You have obviously been able to start and maintain a relationship with your best friend. If your really worried about your mental health see a doctor so that he give give you a proper diagnosis and treatment and medication if need be. But it may just be a part the anxieties of growing up. I dont really know anyone who isnt self conscious about their body. If you want to be happier you have to take chances and go for the things you want. Try not to worry so much about what other people think because at the end of the day, its your life. They have nothing to do with what you are working towards and wont do anything for you. They dont feed you or cloth you so they dont need to have a say in how you conduct your life.          \nI admire the fact that your religious convictions are so strong and keep you going. \n \nI don\'t recommend anti-depressant drugs. Take a look at the dangers involved and the unscientific methods by which you get diagnosed with a mental illness by doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists. This school of mental healing is based largely upon conjecture and has less grounding in science than witchcraft. But don\'t take my word for it or the word of anyone else on this forum for that matter. Read the first link below which tells the facts from the mouths of actual psychiatrists and doctors. Get the facts before you make your choice:  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat you are feeling is caused by a combination of things: all of the failures you have had in life plus a collection of irrational feelings based on painful mental and physical experiences in your life, some of which you can partially recall on your own and some of which you can\'t yet recall at all. This is a scientific fact. It was proven in millions of cases. The reference is "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health." It has been curing (not merely treating as doctors, psychology and psychiatry attempt to do) depression and anxiety and the feelings you are suffering from for over sixty years.   \n \nBest wishes, \nMatthew          \nI dont think its a good idea to list all of those \'problems\' like that... it will make you feel worse about yourself, and you\'ll start believing that the problems are so severe that you wont be able to get over them. Like if you keep telling yourself that you have low self-esteem, you WILL have low self-esteem. \r\nYou care a hell of a lot of what other people think, and high school is hard enough, what with all the bitchiness and popularity and importance of looks. Trust me, i\'ve been there. Every girl I know thinks they are ugly... or too fat... or too skinny. My best memories at high school are due to my friends. You are lucky to have a group of friends, so try hard to keep your friendship because most people only know how valuable it is after they lost it. \r\nAnd I think your best friend did help you- the answer is in talking to others. You obviously want to change your ways, and if you are really that determined to do so, then tomorrow, at school, you\'ll start talking to people more, smiling more... and build that up, every day. \r\nYou\'ll be fine, just make more of an effort with people. join some extra classes, like drama maybe, to help with confidence. Say yes if people invite you to places. \r\nIt\'ll be hard, but you\'ve got to stay strong, and trust me, it\'ll be worth the effort. People mock others all the time, but you\'ve got to keep your head high and the worse thing to do is feel sorry for yourself. \r\n \r\nIf you feel problems worsening, then do talk to someone... but when you start talking more to people and people start being friendly with you, you\'ll feel a high that will hopefully stimulate you to make more of an effort.  \r\nPlease stay happy. You are obviously a likeable person, so you\'ll be fine. Bless xx          \nHave you ever had to undergo authentic panic attack indicators? If so, then you know how anxious and possible fearful they can make a person. The main reason for that is you simply do not know when another one may happen. As you can already grasp, it is feasible to be able to make any type of guess as to when another panic attack episode will occur. Just in the US alone, almost 3 million people suffer form panic disorder which is frequent panic attacks. Well, think about all the undiagnosed people who have had just one panic attack, or maybe two, but nothing on a frequent basis. In this answer, we will go over bunches of signs of a panic attack, and possibly that awareness will aid in identifying others. \r\n \r\nSome of the extraordinary manifestations of a panic attack implying less physical sensations, at least in the impression we often think about them. Sometimes people experience symptoms involving feelings of being unreal. There is a feeling of hollowness, or feelings of marked extrication from one\'s actual being. As you can envision, that must be a rather problematical set of sensations to have to contend with, furthermore it can make a person feel really frightened and frazzled. Every now and then, signs of a panic attack can vary in force and most often cause a lot of horror according to the particular sign. Some people experience the feeling of having a blank mind. Then you have to realize that an indicator of a panic attack can last for a really long time, for example hours. Therefore, if the sensation is powerful enough, then just think about what it must be like to feel like your mind is vacant. That is not to say you will have that symptom if you have had others. There are some medical states that can cause a person to have an unfilled mind, and one of those is a stroke. \r\n \r\nFor some people, panic attacks affect their limbs and extremities. Symptoms can include numbness or tingling in the fingers and hands. A pinched nerve in the wrist, elbow, or spinal column is the typical cause of numbness or tingling sensations. \r\n \r\nThis particular symptom can also be indicative of a mild heart attack or some other related issue. So this causes confusion for the person who has these symptoms, and it\'s difficult to know what to think. This can strike in conjunction with other panic attack symptoms, as well.  \r\n \r\nTypically men experience different symptoms of a panic attack than women do. Similarities do exist, however. Men are about 50% less likely to suffer a panic attack. To help identify whether or not you\'re having a panic attack, try to make note of your symptoms and remember them in case of future attacks.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nIt&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s just polite          \nIt\'s just opening a door... What\'s the big deal? It\'s just a way to be nice. \nI\'m a female, I open doors for other females AND especially males. \nI\'ve seen males open doors for other males too, so like I said what\'s the big deal? \n \nIt\'s getting annoying hearing that girls dont open doors for guys when I know I do and so do my friends! \n \nMe and my ex boyfriend use to hold doors for each other, he even use to stop for me and hold it when he saw me walking towards him. It\'s how we first started communicating as we were too shy to speak to one another Haha!          \nIt\'s not.          \nit&#x27;s not sexist, but I think it&#x27;s fuxxing stupid. \nIf I&#x27;m not asking you to hold the door open for me why would you do it? It&#x27;s not polite, it&#x27;s just plain silly. If I ask for your help then help me If I don&#x27;t then get out of my way.          \nfeminism.  \n \nof course you would do the same for a guy, so would i, its good manners, but feminists have thrown manners and any kind of respectability out of the window..... dressing half naked, being promiscuous, drinking, swearing, tattoos, teenage pregnancy, unknown fathers etc  \n \neven divorce, something that used to be ABSOLUTELY shameful has become "common", leaving broken families and messed up children behind.  \n \nwomen have used their freedom to run riot, and i dont use that term lightly, they literally have been RUNNING RIOT for decades.  \n \nso get used to a world of screwed up individuals and bad manners. welcome to feminism          \nThis particular scenario doesn\'t really scream "sexist" to me.  Sexism has more to do with gender roles.  like who is the one who provides? who takes care of the baby? who cleans the house?  and whatnot. \n \nopening the door, well if you mean that men are expected to hold the door open for the women only, then that\'s feminism.  but if it\'s for another guy, then that\'s just being polite.  just the same as if the woman was the one holding the door open for the guy. although, that would be quite a rare occurrence, taking in to consideration my country\'s culture, since men are expected to treat a woman like a queen. \n \nanyway, personally, i believe it\'s just more on politeness than anything else. :3          \nI have NO IDEA...  \n \nI\'m a woman... I hold the door for whomever is behind me because I feel it is polite. My father isn\'t "Sexist" but holds the door open for women, children, men... Anyone... Because it\'s polite! \n \nI understand why feminazi\'s get butt-hurt by it as much as I understand why the guy in Texas leaving a restaurant with a huge load of takeout freaked when I held the door for him...   \n \nIt must just be damage causing their brains to react as if everything is a victimization or threat to their identities.          \nIt\'s not. Don\'t worry about it, guys open doors for me a lot and the only discomfort I feel is wondering if they do it to look at my butt, lol. At the end of the day it doesnt matter. Open doors for women, I hold doors for anyone behind me and I find it rude when people don\'t. Why let a door slam in someones face? That\'s bad etiquette imo.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I mean its not like i wouldn't hold it open if another guy was coming up behind me to go through the same door its just good manners.  And on top of that if a woman was in front of me going through the door i don't see why she cant hold the door open for me . If we just see each other as male or femail or this or that how can we move on and become better  ",

	{'answer': u'\nNot your problem.          \nBasically everyone who has an abortion regrets it. You need to talk with your sister and make her realize that this is her mistake, and it shouldn\'t be taken out on the baby. She doesn\'t want the baby? Fine. Put it up for adoption. As for you, tell who you need to. This will just keep getting bigger and bigger and it\'s not something you want to live with.          \nboyfriend is lucky it was your 18 year old sister and not you because if I was your father I would slap him with statutory rape charges so fast it would make his head spin. I don\'t think it is fair of your sister to put all of this pressure on you. He is clearly a creep that your oldest sister deserves to know about before she makes the mistake of her life and marries this man or worse yet, gets pregnant herself. If he\'s not cheating on her with your sisters he is probably doing it somewhere else. She is lucky she didn\'t get a STD or worse. The 18 year old might be upset with you for a little while for betraying her secret but you are right that it was her mistake and if she is adult enough to make that choice she is adult enough to accept the consequences. I believe the rest of the family will be grateful to you for revealing his true colors, that he came onto you and when he couldn\'t have it he went for your sister. He\'ll be out of your life and the pressure will be off you.          \nTELL "SARAH". she needs to know so that she can breakup with jamie....and tell chloe not to get an abortion. just like adoption or something.  also this is not your problem so the quicker you can make it so that youre not involved the better          \nHoney that\'s a big one!!!! But you can\'t carry someone\'s else\'s blame neither you didn\'t do anything. Taking the mask of that slum will help. If he\'s not welcome to the house that\'s great but maybe your sister is wondering why?? It\'s time to spill the beans over the table. It\'s not snitching it\'s being honest and respectful your sister broke those 2 rules and she must learn from her mistake. Sisters are sisters here there and in china so they will know how to work their differences and your big sister will open get eyes to the dirt bag she was with.if she\'s pregnant we\'ll that\'s just another consequence and the baby is not at fault. Now if your dad is comprehensive and close to you I would talk to him first as father and daughter. Explain the seriousness of the problem and that you don\'t want to be caught in the middle of the line of fire. He would know what to do since he sounds like a very serious and respectful responsible man. Good luck sweat heart I hope this helps          \ntell the pregnant sister to tell          \nThis thing needs to be brought to light.  Lies and hiding will just make it worse, and now there is a baby\'s life on the line. \r\nAbortion should not be taken lightly, it ends a human life and can leave women with depression and years, decades or the rest of their lives filled with regret and guilt.  Your sister, even though she made a mistake, deserves to keep this baby if she chooses to, and be supported,  She should not rush into an abortion as a cover up, that will just make things worse, and however mad your other sister is, I doubt she would want her niece or nephew killed over it.   \r\nI volunteer for a website that offers adoption info and free support for pregnant girls, and we understand how complex an unexpected pregnancy can be, and would be glad to help you or your sister sort through any issues.  You can email anytime, info@giveyourbabylife.com www.giveyourbabylife.com \r\n \r\nBottom line, once conceived, that baby is a unique, live human with DNA that will never be duplicated ever by any human on Earth.  This is your niece or nephew, and your sister, and both need to be protected and respected.  It\'s not the baby\'s fault, he or she is innocent, alive and deserves to stay that way.  Your sister can ask your other sister to forgive her, and the healing process, however it may progress, will be on it\'s way.          \nJust because you caught your sister having sex with a layabout, that does NOT necessarily mean that he is the father. Are you nuts?? \r\n \r\nLet your sister have the abortion, keep your mouth shut, and everybody is happy. You should also make sure that your sister is on the pill - she will not want this to happen again. Norplant is good, you don\'t have to remember to take it. Swear to keep your mouth shut if and only if your sister goes on the pill. \r\n \r\nMany people believe that unwanted children are more likely to lead a life of crime than wanted ones. So it is better for all of us if your sister does not add one more unwanted child to the world.          \nYou are responsible for telling your sister the truth--abortion will hurt her and will make a murderer of her and the boyfriend.  You know that this isn\'t right, if she doesn\'t listen then you need to do the right thing and tell your mom or sister or someone else.  A baby\'s life is on the line.  Follow your gut and do the right thing.          \nTell everything. Anortion is wrong and shouldn\'t happen. The only way this guy will permanently leave is if your sister breaks up with him. It will take a while but your sisters will heal in there relationship with eachother. You\'ll only get in trouble if your older sister finds out down the road and finds out you knew about it. Just tell your parents and sister.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I really don't know what to do. \r\nOk so I'm 17 years old, my sister is 18 and my other sister is 21. We have a brother who's 23 but he's irrelevant in this (lol). \r\nOk I'll change names in this. My sister who's 21 (the one with the boyfriend) lets call her Sarah, and my sister who's 18 (slept with Sarah's boyfriend) lets call her Chloe.  \r\nAnd the scumbag boyfriend, we'll call him Jamie. *all names changed* \r\nOk so Jamie is a big of a man whore. He's tried it on with me (he's like 24) but I've rejected his advances, and haven't told anyone because I don't want to cause upset in my family. He's a slob, doesn't have a job who sits playing Xbox all day. My family are a family of hard workers so it angers me when he invites himself to our house and plays games. (He is however wary of my dad- who is high up in the police- my dad hates him because my dad is self disciplined and brought us up this way) and my dad lets him know this. Ok so about 5 weeks ago I walked in the house to hear blaring music coming from upstairs, I walked up to see it was coming from Chloe's room, (no surprise there) I pushed the ajar door to let her know I was home so she didn't get a shock if she turned her music off and heard noises downstairs. (Let me add I was home from college about an hour earlier than I should've due to well erm, woman reasons lol. Everyone else was out at work including my mom, dad Sarah and my brother) well as I pushed the door open I found Chloe and Jamie on Chloe's bed, at it. Chloe quickly realised and started to get dressed and explain herself while he lay there smugly. I didn't leave the doorway, demanding an explanation. Well after about an hour of coaxing, she explained it was just a silly mistake and no-one needs to know. I wasn't comfortable, but I didn't want to tear my family apart, however I'm still disgusted and protested to my dad I wouldn't be comfortable with Jamie in the house, and my dad agreed, which made Jamie no longer welcome at our house. Well I thought that was okay, until yesterday when my sister told me she was pregnant. She says its quite early and she doesn't plan on telling the family and just having an abortion. I don't know if I can keep this secret as well, it's her mistake and I'm suffering and feeling guilty, I don't want to betray her by telling Sarah and my family but I don't want to betray Sarah by not telling her and letting her carry on with his layabout man. I really don't know what to do.  ",

	{'answer': u"\nWell i used to be TERRIFIED of drop rides, mainly because of the feeling you are going to fall out, but then i realised, if it doesnt give you that huge rush of adrenaline during the ride, there'd be no point of it.  The scared feeling is the purpose of the ride, you only have one life, so go have fun, scream till you lose your voice :D          \nHi there. Don't worry, help is at hand :D. \r\n \r\nStealth - The drop really isn't that big, and once you're at the top and about to go down, the drop lasts two seconds and then you're down again. You NEED to ride Stealth because I honestly believe there's no point going to Thorpe Park if you're not going to ride it. Trust me, I tried avoiding it nearly all day, until 2 o clock, I got on it, rode it, and absolutely loved it! Do it! :) \r\n \r\nSaw > Sorry to inform you, it's a 100 degree drop lol. But really, the big big drop outside, is just like the drop on Stealth, over in a few seconds, and then you're put through an Immelmann loop and going on to enjoy the rest of the ride. There really is nothing to be scared of! As for the drop inside, it's nearly vertical, but not quite, maybe 80 degrees. You don't expect it and I'd say it's more fun in my case, for you though maybe, it may be worse. Just a short quick drop though, go for it, it's brilliant. \r\n \r\n \r\nRush > I have to say, you probably won't like this ride. EVERY time it swings it feels like  you're going to fall out because of the lap bars, but, nonetheless, I think you should go for it, because the feeling of falling out is the reason it was made, and is a great experience. \r\n \r\n \r\nSlammer > I understand when you say, it just looks scary, even I had trouble going on it at first. But, it really isn't as bad as it looks. It's just a few swings round and it's over, a great freefall experience. As for the pain, the seats could be a little more comfortable, and hurt your back a bit, but, it doesn't hurt your head. \r\n \r\n \r\nGood Luck, let me know how it goes!          \nI was scared of stealth when i went on it last year but i just jumped on too. Make sure all your freinds go on so that you feel alone and then you will get on just so you arent alone. Just go on it its really fun. im going in about 2 weeks. tip get there early and you can go on stealth like 3 times without a line but you have to book the tickets online          ",

	 'question': u"\n    I have actually joined the site already after reading up on a scam-advising site that it appeared to be 96% safe, I see that percentage has dropped on the same site to 64% and will probably continue to drop.  I believe it is legitimate, however you are requested to give a lot of your personal details away when filling each task which not only makes you worry about it ending up in the wrong hands but in turn blocks up your mail, email and phone with spam. Supposedly in order to earn \xa3300+ per month the requirement is to complete 26 tasks (more like surveys mostly from well known service providers etc) after which you can claim your earnings for all 26 tasks, you do not get any of your earnings if you don't complete all 26.  You can not move on to a task without completing the one before, so if there is a particular task you don't want to do then you don't go further and you lose out on the ones you have already completed.  It also seems that after having done a small number of tasks (only 4 or 5) most people complain that they aren't given anymore to do for days and then their accumulated earnings seem to deplete.   All the participants who I have read comments about on their experiences with signing up seem to get to the 4th or 5th task and then have to part with a bit of money.  In my case, task 4 was signing up with a renown and very genuine online video steaming company for the free 30 day trial, which I could cancel at any time before the days had lapsed but would have to enter my bank details in the event I didn't want to cancel after 30 days (to pay the monthly rental fee), for signing up to the trial and watching the equivalent of 5 hours streaming I would earn \xa380 from paidoffers, I didn't get as far as putting my details in and the site had a tempory glitch.  Despite that, strangely, I was still able to move on to task 5 which was for a reputable home insurance company but the task was to request a quote and sign up for the home insurance which I would then have to keep for at least 60 days, for which I would also be paid a fair sum by paidoffers.  That is as far as I went as I realised that by the time I get to 26 I would have to cancel subscriptions etc that I didn't really want and have money to pay for should I not get my money from paidoffers promptly.

	{'answer': u'\nI hold the door open for people coming out, people with lots of stuff, old people and people with small children.  Doesn\'t matter their sex - or mine.          \nAgreed.  Very much so.          \nI agree, but it doesn\'t irritate me that much.          \nHave you ever heard "Ladies First." It\'s just the way it is.          \nWomen traded the "door thing" long ago for equality. Those who think they are entitled to a door being opened for them are living in the dark ages, but the first to scream equality...you cannot have it both ways. I do not have the same experience as you...doors are held for me whether it is a man or a woman. Common curtesy rules, not old fashioned rules. Be nice to people and they will be nice back to you.          \nIt\'s polite to hold the door for a woman.  Now is it necessary hellllll no.  But I prefer to be polite.  And I would walk through the door if mother Teresa was holding it open say thanks and continue on my way.          \nI open doors no matter who is behind me, except when i was at work and i looked back and this ***** was behind me i immediately let it go...lol.          \nYes I agree with you. I don\'t mind. Sometimes I open the door for guys all the time. What\'s the point? As long as you\'re helping someone. I also hate it when someone is carrying something heavy across the room and no one is there to open it for the other person. That is just messed up. Maybe they don\'t realize it, but then the door opens and close and opens and close because the other person cannot get through. LoL. It\'s just messed up. I don\'t know about those people who aren\'t respectable and have great manners. It pisses me off when someone close the door in my face or doesn\'t say thank you if I happen to open the door. One time, I opened the door for this girl, and she just walked out while texting and kept going, I should\'ve slammed it in her face. Am I being a hypocrite here? lol. Oo wells. Damn people. =) Great question.          \nI tried NOT holding doors open for people and one lady got hit at quicktrip and said "well thanks" with extreme sarcasm. this irritated me, but from then on I just hold the door if its within arms reach. no prob.          \nIf a person (man or woman) is carrying a load, I\'ll open the door for them. \r\n \r\nIf someone opens the door for me, I\'ll tell them thank you and walk through. \r\n \r\nThe only time I had an issue with this, was back in the early 70\'s. I opened a door for a lady, because she had a briefcase and a bag of fast food in her hands. \r\n \r\nBoy, did she let me have it. She called me a sexist pig and did I think she was a helpless female, yadda, yadda. \r\n \r\nA couple weeks later here she comes again. She\'s got the briefcase, a stack of papers and it\'s raining cats and dogs. \r\n \r\nI get to the door first, I just walk in and let the door close behind me. She fumbles with the door handle and drops her papers in the water puddle. I\'m standing about three feet away and I\'m just watching her scoop up soggy papers. \r\n \r\nWhen she finally gets in, she asks why I didn\'t help her. I told her us sexist pigs don\'t like to get wet.          \nIt\'s just common sense and good manners to open a door for another person, regardless of sex.          \nIn a world where there is so little communication of a civilised nature - holding a door open is just a passing niceness for the world that says \'there you go, I acknowledge you exist\'! \r\n \r\nIt is no big deal - if you feel like opening a door - do it. \r\nIf you don\'t - don\'t. Nobody will notice if you don\'t. But somebody may if you do. \r\n \r\nAs for females allowing doors to be opened - it to is a non-verbal acknowledgement that A GENTLEMAN has made a non-sexual tribute to a lady and that she appreciates it by going through the door and saying \'thank you\'. \r\n \r\nIt is the little pleasantries in life that make a bad day bearable! \r\n \r\nHave a good day!          \nI have never in my life seen a woman insist that the door be opened for her, but if she did it would be completely rude, whether or not the man was holding something. Obviously if he must set anything down to open the door and doesn\'t do so freely, than that woman is beyond rude. \r\nI open doors for men all the time, but it\'s not really the same thing. I just do it because it would be rude to let it swing on him. If a man goes out of the way to open the door for a woman, than that is gentlemanly of him but not to be expected and certainly not demanded. \r\n \r\n \r\nAlso, I want to add that while the polite thing to do is say thank you, it is a greater offense to call attention to the fact that someone didn\'t. They may have something on their mind, just let it go.          \nDon\'t go shopping with girlfriends or wives, then.          \nI think you have FAR too much time on your hands if you\'re worrying about something as silly as this. \r\nI\'ve never seen a woman "insist" that the man she is with hold the door open.  I have seen men who prefer to allow women to enter first, and I love this.  It\'s a sign of respect for a man to want to wait for a woman to enter in front of him. \r\nThere are so MANY women who get attitude when a guy walks ahead of them the poor men don\'t know what to do. \r\n \r\nNow, look around find a REAL problem.          \nI can see why that would annoy you.  It would definitely annoy me if I took the time to hold a door open for a person and refused it because I\'m a woman! \r\n \r\nAs a child, I was taught that opening a door for someone is common courtesy, especially if that person is carrying something, elderly, physically disabled or pregnant.  I\'ll hold a door open for anyone, if I happen to get to it first.  It\'s just good manners.          \nI hear ya!!!! This is a good question!!!! I agree that whoever gets there first should just open the door. I mean really, i hate standing there (looking stupid) waiting for him to open my door, when I could have done it.  \r\nOkay it\'s like this, you pull up to the store, your usually in a hurry~~~while he is putting the car in park, taking the key out,getting out his self, walking around the car, then opening my door~~~~I\'m on the way back to the car~~~~you know why?? CAUSE I CAN OPEN MY OWN DOOR!!!! I\'ll be later than all get out if I wait for him to open my door everytime we go somewhere!!!  If you get out or in yourself it really saves time~~~not to mention he\'s not my butler or the door man!!! \r\nAny woman who does not open their own door is just lazy or spoiled(and I don\'t mean spoiled in a good way!!)          \nyup. this is pretty stupid. but over here, we dont really see that many cases like this, cos man\'s and woman\'s roles here - in holding open doors at least - seem equal. \r\n \r\nbut - here\'s the very big BUT - the problem with our countrymen is that some ppl dont even bother to hold open the door for you. he/she holds it open for him/herself, then promptly lets go when he/she\'s done, and lets the door slam in your face. lol! that annoys me like ****. \r\n \r\nand yes, if i were to witness or experience an experience like what you described, i\'d hate it to **** too. \r\n \r\nhumans are humans, and we are made with hands.          \nokay? u should join my yahoo group. we discuss annoying things like this. it\'s called haterz. just search it. or u can go on my 360 page and click on the link at the bottom. just click on my profile, and go to my 360.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I\'m not gonna lie.  This annoys me so much!!! \r\n \r\nIt annoys me when the guy / man is holding more stuff than the girl / woman and the girl insists that he open the door.  If you\'re capable of opening a door and you\'re not on a date and you\'re closer to the door, then do it! \r\n \r\nIt also annoys me when the woman opens the door for the man and the man refuses to walk through the door because a woman\'s holding it open.  WHAT THE HECK?!  That\'s just being sexist. \r\n \r\nBasically, I hate those "macho" guys and the girls who act too fragile to open their own door to the restaurant / car! LOL! \r\n \r\nDoes this annoy you? \r\n \r\nAnd why look behind you when you\'re at the door to see if it\'s a man or woman to see whether you should hold it open?  Why not just open the door REGARDLESS?  This is where I think the male and female roles go too far.  A woman can do anything a man can do and it\'s JUST a door.  It doesn\'t take a MACHO MAN to open a door.  ',

	{'answer': u"\nNo, as a sister, don't tell your parents. You have to be her sister. Just let her know that you don't want to see her doing that again and if you do, you'll DEFINATELY tell on her. \r\n \r\n=]          \nTell your parents.  She'll hate you for it, but it's in her best interest.          \ndun tell on ur sister, it will cause a rift in ur r'ship with her. try to talk nicely to her and explain why u r concerned. \r\n \r\nat the end of the day, it is her life and her body and u can't tell her wat to do.. all u can do is try.          \nYou should tell em if your sister wasn't and her boyfriend weren't using protection. If they don't know about that yet, then they're too young.          \nDo your sister a very big favor... tell her that you're gonna tell your parents and whether she like it or not, tell your parents what you saw..no more no less.          \nwhere were your parents?  and should you tell?  no there is nothing to tell your story and then your sisters story          \nI think you should tell her that if she promises to stop what she's doing you promise not to tell.          \nI don't think you should tell your parents, unless you want to have your sister hate you for a long time.  I think you could do more good for her, if you maintain her confidence.  Remember though: in the end, you can't live someone else's life for them.  If she's bound and determined to have sex, neither you or your parents are going to be able to stop her...          \nBefore you tell on her you really need to just talk to her about all the risk and then if you catch her again, you should inform your parents. The reason I am telling you not to tell is because I know that if you become a tattle-tell in the eyes of your sibling, it is going to make it tough for you the two of you to get along. So don't complicate things just yet. Explain to her that you care deeply and tell her if you catch her again, you are going to your parents to ensure her safety.  \r\n \r\nGood Luck!          \nIf it was me in this situation i'd tell my sister that i care about her and don't want her to get hurt and tell her that i'd rather she was honest with me so when the time came that i needed someone to talk to i could rely on her. If you tell your parents she'll be angry at you and you may not have her support when it comes to you dating boys. \r\nTell her if she's going to have sex to be safe.          \nNo dont tell on your sister just let her know that you would rather her wait, you two are sisters just think if it was the other way around.          \nYou need to tell your parents so they can get a handle on your sister and the situation. If she is up to this no good at 14, she's going to have a pretty big track record before she's 18.  Who knows, STDS, pregnant, raped...if you care about her, i'd tell.  If something happened to her because you kept your silence, well, you have to live with it my man.          \nShe is too young to be having sex and \r\nshe might get pregnant or get STDs. \r\nTell your parents what she is doing. \r\nIf you don't tell she might do it again. \r\nYour parents should be the ones \r\ntalking to her about sex not you.  \r\nOnce they find out she will \r\nthink twice next time.          \nYou can advise her in a civilized tone. Also tell her is she\u2019s going to do it, use protection. Tell her the BF is a sissy for running away like that.          \nDon't  tell parents.  Talk about condoms and stuff first.  Maybe she is already on the pill but never told u.          \nwow 14? What a coward boy to run away.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    This is a HUGE shock for me!! I just walked into her room and all I saw was two naked people on top of each other.  Her boyfriend ran out of the house, and after like a half hour I went back into her room and discussed with her how she shouldn't be having sex and all the risks.  She completely denied it.  She said her boyfriend was wearing boxers and she was wearing a shirt.  I can't believe her because, 1. I saw what I saw and that was two NAKED people and 2. If they were that exposed to one another, it was probably going to lead to sex.  This was awkward for me, because she's only 14 and I'm only 13.  She told me not to tell our parents, and I told her I don't know what to do, which is true.  I can't imagine what my parents would do, because they get angry at her when she disapears for even 5 minutes with her boyfriend.  I care about her and I don't want her to get pregnant or get STDs or anything.  Do you think telling my parents would be the right choice?  ",

It doesn\'t matter what you believe, Satan works for God, always has and always will.          \nHell was created for satan and his demons. It was never meant for people. But people who dont believe in god, people who dont follow EVERY word of god, and people who dont repent, forgive, release anger away....they will be sent to hell. For no unclean thing and no un purity thing shall be in heaven. \r\n \r\nI dont need to read all what you wrote. If you read the bible then you know the truth. This is the truth.          \nPlain Bible passages say the sinner will suffer in Hell eternally (Mt. 25:46; Mk. 9:43-48; Re. 14:10-11; 19:20; 20:10).  The Bible also says the punishment of the unsaved will be worse than violent death (Mk. 9:42). This proves the punishment is not annihilation, but is eternal torment. (3) Jesus said it would have been better if Judas had never been born (Mt. 26:24). Jesus\' words make no sense if Judas was only going to be annihilated.          \nEverlasting is a matter of interpretation. As a young child, 3 months is an eternity. To the adult, it speeds by. Also when we suffer, any amount of time is too long. Perception plays into the carnal estimation of "everlasting". Day and night does not exist in eternity since the universe is not a part of eternity with its stars, planets, time, matter, etc. Hell is a place where God isn\'t. As long as we are there, time passes slowly. God\'s nature is to punish, then restore...if there is repentance. If someone would rather simmer in hell than repent, that is their choice. And believe me, I\'ve known people who said they would rather suffer in hell for eternity than bend a knee to God. That is the epitome of rebellion.          \nWe are all sinners because of Adam but some people will believe in Jesus and be born again John 2 \r\nWhich makes them a new person and they wont be called sinners because Jesus died in their place for their sins. The people that do not believe in Jesus will be included with the sinners and satan and his angels in the lake of fire.          \nYour source is dubious. It\'s pretty safe to assume no one is going to hell. Also, Satan and all other angels are imaginary.          \n \r\nThis excerpt quote from the Catholic Encyclopedia is very revealing:  \r\nIn the same way the Greeks and Romans may have worshipped their divinities, fondly believing them to be good. But the Christian Scriptures declare that all the gods of the Gentiles are demons.  \r\nCatholic Encyclopedia: Devil Worship  \r\n  \r\nDEMONS ARE THE GODS OF THE GENTILES!!!!  \r\n \r\nSatanism is not a Christian invention  \r\nSatanism predates Christianity and all other religions  \r\nSatanism is not about "evil"  \r\nSatanism is not about death  \r\nTrue Satanism is about elevating and empowering humanity to reach equality with the Gods, which was our True Creator (Satan\'s) intention  \r\n"IN THE SECRET OF MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO GOD BUT ME" \r\n-SATAN \r\nFrom "Peace Be Unto Him"  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nDue to centuries of misinformation, lies, and the systematic removal of knowledge, few people these days understand or even know what \u201cSatanism\u201d really is all about.  \r\n \r\nChristianity has been at liberty to dictate without any opposition, what they CLAIM Satanism to be. In order to accomplish this, the truth had to be destroyed. The Catholic Church (the original Christian Church, from which all Christian sects have evolved), heinously tortured to death and mass-murdered millions of innocent men, women and children in what was known as "The Inquisition." Some children who were burnt to death in what were known as "witch houses" were as young as two years of age. \r\n \r\nChristians forever rant and rave concerning the "one world order" where all identities, cultures, personal privacies, and liberties will be lost and humanity, after being systematically bar-coded, will be lumped into a one-world slave state. What they fail to see is how their own so-called "religion" and bible have always been and are the roots of and blueprint for this regime. Everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible has been stolen and corrupted from religions predating Judaism, Christianity, and Islam from hundreds to thousands of years. Through Judaism and its tool of Christianity, all of the original spiritual teachings from around the world, (which are CONCEPTS) have been stolen from, lumped together into the "one," and corrupted into Jewish archetypes and characters and fictitious places. This has given the Jewish people as a whole a false history, political power and "spiritual" authority to which they are not entitled.  \r\n \r\nThe bible is a very powerful subliminal tool to control the masses. One can see this is a man-made work as there are endless contradictions. The bible has been systematically drummed into the minds of the populace from a very early age. A lie must always be enforced as opposed to the truth which can stand on its own. Because spiritual knowledge and occult power have been removed and kept in the hands of a "chosen" few, the unknowing populace has been helpless against it. The agenda here is to create a one-world slave state with the "chosen" few ruling at the top. The perpetrators of course blame Satan to create a necessary distraction, while they use occult power to accomplish their ends. They have a history of stealing from and blaming their enemies for everything they really are and do, while always holding themselves in the highest esteem and innocence.  \r\n \r\nThe original religions now known as "Satanism" (by the way, "Satan" means "enemy" in Hebrew), were all based upon what is known as the "Magnum Opus" or Great Work. The one known as "Satan" is our True Creator God. He was prevented by the other Gods from finishing his work on humanity, that of the godhead. The godhead is physical and spiritual perfection. Now, if you continue to read on, I will prove this.  \r\n \r\nThe serpent is seen everywhere in ancient relics and structures. The serpent was held sacred in all areas of the ancient world. Satan is the God Ea, aka ENKI, one of the first of the Nephilim to arrive on this planet and establish the first civilization. In Sumerian mythology, Enki\'s symbol was always the serpent.  \r\nThe serpent represents the DNA, the life force and the kundalini and has survived as the emblem of the American Medical Association and Veterinary medicine, where it is symbolic of life and healing. Only with the coming of Judeo/Christianity, has this sacred symbol been desecrated and blasphemed.  \r\n \r\n \r\nNearly all of us are familiar with the term "fallen." This word has been used copiously by Christian clergy to refer to Satan and his Demons. In truth, "fallen" pertains to the kundalini serpent (which has always been associated with our Creator God Satan), which has fallen in humanity as a whole and now lies dormant at the base of the spine. Because of this, humanity as a whole is on a very low level of spiritual understanding. Thoughtless abuses of children and animals, senseless wars, brutality and endless corruption are the results of the fallen serpent..... \r\n \r\n          \nIf all sinners went to hell, then that means every single person in this world would burn in hell, but only the people who believe in christ, and ask for forgiveness will be saved from the eternal fire.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Will only Satan and his angels be tormented in Hell forever, or will all sinners suffer eternally as well? \r\nIf you could use verses from the Bible to help me understand that would be very appreciated.  \r\n \r\nIn these verses it says "eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." (Matt 25:41) \r\nbut also "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand (Rev 14:9) "He will be tormented with burning sulfur... (Rev 14:10) \r\n \r\n \r\nIn Matthew 18:8  \r\n "If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire." \r\n \r\nMatthew 25:41  \r\n"Then he will say to those on his left, \'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. \r\n \r\nRev 14:9,10 \r\n"A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, \r\n(10) he, too, will drink of the wine of God\'s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb." \r\n \r\nRev: 20:10 \r\n"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."  ',

	{'answer': u'\nA man should be a man, and open the door, give up his seat and take out the trash for his family. Nothing can make anyone more proud and cost nothing to do. And yes, a young woman should give her seat to any elderly or disabled persons in public areas. Could you imagine not opening the door for a soldier?? Who may have lost his hands or limbs to protect our wonderful country. Just keep that in mind before putting yourself "first". Open doors, say "thank you", and stand so others may sit even though no one else is doing so.          \nI think any young, healthy person should give their seat to anyone who is infirm, elderly or heavily pregnant. If you were ever pregnant you would agree with me. I hold the door open for women who have children or have them in a cart, not a 20 y.o. who\'s capable of opening a door. I don\'t expect anyone to open my car door, that\'s silly and wastes time.          \nI think being a gentleman, or for all that matters, being kind is never outdated.  I will open doors to the elderly, those with packages and swarm of children.  If they don\'t appreciate it, that\'s their problem.   \r\n \r\nAs far as opening doors, I walk through and hold it open for the next person.  I don\'t stand there and be a doorman, but I don\'t let the door slam on the face of the person behind me either.  The person behind me should say "Thank you" and we move on with our lives.          \nIt\'s interesting that you consider your views to be representative of New England. I grew up in Connecticut, outside New York and I have honestly never seen a woman refuse to go through a door because a man held it open for her and I\'ve never heard anyone say anything about the sexism you seem to think is inherent in this gesture.  \r\n \r\nI agree that people should be treated equally, but I think that people should be treated equally well, whereas you seem to think that people should be treated equally poorly. I appreciate it when a man holds a door for me. I also appreciate it when a woman holds the door for me. And I will hold the door for both men and women. I never think about whether my actions or anyone else\'s are motivated by "a code-book of social rules" or some kind of sexism. I think people are just trying to be polite and considerate.  \r\n \r\nFrankly, I\'d be just as baffled by that kind of ridiculous behavior as your friend from the South. He was being polite and she was being deliberately ungrateful. If everyone in your area behaves the same way, no wonder people think New Englanders are rude.          \nI like how you call your part of the country \'more enlightened\' but then in the next paragraph they are \'very sheltered\'. \n \nAs a man, I think women should be treated like queens.  That means I, as a man, open her door, give up my seat, pick up the check, etc.  To call that sexist or chauvinist implies that I\'m doing those things because I think she can\'t or that I\'m better at it.  The fact is, I\'m performing those menial tasks because I think she shouldn\'t have to. \n \nClass doesn\'t enter into it at all.  I don\'t know where you got that.  And black people are still people, men and women.  And yes, I treat women differently because they are women and I am not, whether they\'re black, white or purple doesn\'t matter.  I don\'t demean them, I don\'t belittle them.  I offer them the luxury of not having to do the \'little things\' in life like opening a door or standing when there\'s a perfectly good chair I\'m sitting in.  If some women in your area or others, enlightened folks as you call them, see that as bad then they don\'t have to accept my gesture.  But stop acting like you\'re somehow better for doing so.          \nChivalry is a kind of "booby prize" that existed to make up for the fact that women didn\'t have the vote and were completely dependent on men.  It\'s always interesting to me how we have changed gender roles, but don\'t even realize how many components of our customs no longer make sense in the new system. \n \nAs to giving up your seat to a women, I disagree. Doing so implies all women are weak.   \n \nOpening the door for a women is a nice, harmless gesture I support. \n \nMy big issue is with career women who expect men to pay for dinner and judge boyfriends on earning capacity.  The "pay for dinner" thing came from a time when men had all the best jobs.  Getting equal access to the high-end careers means you get equal financial responsibility.          \nSigh.  I\'m from the South and your part of the country sounds very cold, unwelcoming and unfriendly.  Social niceties make life, well, nice!  Why would that be a bad thing?   \r\n \r\nAnd, you can\'t really call good manners an "old system" just because they aren\'t practiced where you live.  Manners are very much practiced in other parts of the country. \r\n \r\nI recently moved to a part of the country where a large percentage of the population is transplanted Yankees.  Good manners and looking out for your fellow man are not the norm here.  Road rage, even to the point of murder, is not uncommon.  This is in no way better than where I came from where people helped each other, held open doors for each other, and didn\'t shoot each other over being cut off in traffic.          \nAs a woman I would never expect a man to give up a seat for me, or open a door for me. I do come from the South and I\'d say doors are held for me quite often. This old system did suggest women were delicate. But I, and most women today are hardly delicate flowers. \nBut these are quick, simple gestures, and when someone holds a door for me I feel no connection to sex, just basic human kindness. I can\'t imagine getting angry, since the split-second intention for holding a door is genuine. Why not just say "Thank You" and pay it forward? \nAs for giving up his seat, I would protest strongly, but I am not going to be rude to someone who just wants to be nice. My taking the seat also brings this type person pleasure. He wouldn\'t offer otherwise. So, after protesting unsuccessfully I just take the seat. Why not, I won\'t complain about sitting. \nOn the other hand I always hold the door for a person to at least take a hold of if they are directly behind me, and always hold it for elderly people, pregnant women (having been there), and a woman with lots of kids in tow or person holding a lot in their hands. \nPeople are increasingly cold and hostile to strangers. That is far more upsetting to me than someone just trying in their own way to be nice. \n \nEDIT: CHAK-very interesting read! I don\'t think you sound chauvinistic at all. I do agree that it is still a time of transition in many places. You are right that it is important to follow the norms of an area as best possible.  \nI too struggle when I finally accept the seat that I didn\'t protest enough, or perhaps I appear lazy for taking it. But basically, I do so because (in this time of transition) the person offering was raised to do so and BELIEVES he is doing the right thing. Since the gesture is genuine, it would be pointless and petty of me to be offensive and refuse... it\'s such a little thing that honestly makes little difference in my life or his.          \nI\'m from the Midwest and appreciate good manners and kindness.  I love being a woman and being treated well by the men I encounter.  I was raised by southern parents who taught us proper etiquette.  I am often appauled by the lack of respect people show each other these days.  On the other hand, I\'ve experienced young people with lovely manners.  \r\n \r\nI am an independent woman and have always been capable of doing for myself.  It\'s just so nice when people remember their manners and put forth a little effort.  I guess, if your parents didn\'t teach you these things, you probably don\'t know what\'s appropriate.  A rule of thumb: it costs nothing to be kind and generous, and it makes everyone feel so good.  I applaud all the \'gentlemen\' out there; you are appreciated.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Recently another user asked a question about who he should give up a subway seat to. He said that he knew he should give it up to people who are old or carrying a lot of packages (I agree), but wanted to know about the gray areas. \r\n \r\nBasically a lot of users said that a gentleman should always give up his seat to ANY woman regardless of her age, or to any "elder" man (regardless of his physical ability to stand). Similarly, a woman should yield her seat to an elder man, etc. \r\n \r\nThis is all very interesting to me. Where I grew up (in the socially liberal Five-College area of Massachusetts) if you held a door for a female, or offered a seat, you were were (and are) a male chauvinist. A friend from the South was baffled when he held a door for a girl, who glared at him and refused to walk through. \r\n \r\nNow that I\'m just slightly older, I agree with the traditions of my birthplace: people ought to be treated equally. No special treatment nor special restrictions based on race, sex, or religion. Females have legs that work just as well as anybody else\'s legs. \r\n \r\nI grew up where Dutch dating, letting women open their own doors, and giving them a firm handshake are all the norm, and doing otherwise is considered unacceptable evidence of sexism by many males and females alike. \r\n \r\nI consider myself fortunate to have been born in a more enlightened part of the country (yes I know, New England ego-centrism springs eternal). But I think I mean it. It promotes a type of relationship among people in society that is very healthy in my opinion. \r\n \r\nThe people where I live are (I *think*) just as nice and kind-hearted as people anywhere, and if you have a cane, or a load of packages in your hand, they will give you their subway seat in a heartbeat, *and* their acts of generosity are motivated by a genuine sense of kindness, not adherence to a code-book of social rules. But I also realize that mine is a very sheltered part of the country. \r\n \r\nSo what do you think?  ',

	{'answer': u"\nIt's just common courtesy to hold the door open for anyone, whether it's you holding it open for a male or female.

	{'answer': u'\nYes, when you die you aren\'t God\'s anymore, and if you don\'t pray on Earth for God to save you, the devil will take you away.          \nGod loves you the way an abusive drunk husband loves you. \r\nHe hits you because he he loves you and because you called the cops again.          \nGod and the "devil" are the same entity. Good thing they\'re not real.          \nTheologically speaking, the devil does not have the power to condemn anyone to damnation.  Simply to tempt.          \nPeople send themselves to hell, sweety.          \nIt\'s a strange way of showing love          \nIt is. You can choose heaven. One thing is for sure, it is between hell and heaven you get to choose. Satan tries to lure you to hell and many people are easy prey          \nWas it not the "devil" who caused the fall of man, with his lies?          \nWell, people torture people endlessly for mistakes here on earth, so perhaps its not just devils.          \nyes it is the work of the devil. God has an open invite to everyone, you have to accept that in order to reject natural desires of self which is satan. (PS....does not matter how you live to be one with God)....How you live has its own circumstance and consequences that are the same for those who choose heaven OR hell          \nYes, you\'re right. The problem of evil has always been a difficult one for Christians and other religious people. If God created everything, then he also created Satan. If god is all-knowing (omniscient) and he created Satan with the full knowledge of his turn to evil, then surely God knew he was creating something which would tempt men to be evil. Surely this was an evil act in itself. \r\n \r\nThe only alternative is that God didn\'t know what was going to happen. Christians often say that we, and god\'s creations have free will. But that still doesn\'t explain why he created Satan or why he allows evil. \r\n \r\nHere\'s your options: \r\n1. God is evil \r\n2. God doesn\'t know everything \r\n3. It\'s all a load of old BS          \nIt is. God is working to keep people out of Hell.  \r\n \r\n2 Peter 3:9  The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. \r\n \r\nEzekiel 18:23  Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?          \nAre you joking? then everybody would be there. And I have other plans. \u2665 \u2020 \u2665 \u263a \r\n \r\nTa-ta.          \nactually it is the devil\'s job to seduce you and push you to make that most sins so as to go to hell,,, so actually the devil is trying to send you to hell... \r\n \r\nalso no you won\'t be tortured in hell endlessly for small mistakes,,, as a muslim we belive that you will be tortured endlessly in hell if you commit the biggest sin and crime ever on earth that is not warshipping the one true and the only true god.... \r\n \r\n112.001 Say: He is God, the One and Only;  \r\n \r\n112.002 God, the Eternal, Absolute;  \r\n \r\n112.003 He begetteth not, nor is He begotten;  \r\n \r\n112.004 And there is none like unto Him.  \r\n \r\nso if you believe in god as the way above and then you commit some sins you may be tortured in hell an amount relative to those sins and then you will go to heaven.... also if you regret a sin and stop doing it allah may forgive you and you may not be tortured at all for that sin \r\n \r\nI have more answers and explanations but just wanted to make things short and nice..........          \nPlease understand that God doesn\'t send anyone to hell. Hell is a choice. You have two options: Heaven or Hell. It\'s a 50/50 chance. God won\'t force you to choose. You have to make that decision by following God or not. \r\n \r\nGod\'s door to heaven is open and he is calling out to us to enter. If we reject his offer then we have chosen to stay outside, which is hell. \r\n \r\nI hope this was helpful.          \nNo, it is the work of my own past deeds; it was in my hand but I messed it up and I am bound to reap its consequences to wipe it off for good in future.          \nperhaps the devil we give safe harbour to inwardly... here is an interesting perspective on hell, being not "eternal" as we have been told but just a very long time of dissolution the responsibility of which rests squarely onlur shoulders: \r\nELEMENTARY SPIRITS. -- Properly, the disembodied souls of the depraved; these souls having at some time prior to death separated from themselves their divine spirits, and so lost their chance for immortality. Eliphas Levi and some other kabalists make little distinction between elementary spirits who have been men, and those beings which people the elements, and are the blind forces of nature. Once divorced from their bodies, these souls (also called "astral bodies") of purely materialistic persons, are irresistibly attracted to the earth, where they live a temporary and finite life amid elements congenial to their gross natures. From having never, during their natural lives, cultivated their spirituality, but subordinated it to the material and gross, they are now unfitted for the lofty career of the pure, disembodied being, for whom the atmosphere of earth is stifling and mephitic, and whose attractions are all away from it. After a more or less prolonged period of time these material souls will begin to disintegrate, and finally, like a column of mist, be dissolved, atom by atom, in the surrounding elements.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nI can answer the pumpkin thing.  Pumpkin is a type of winter squash that is in season right now.

	{'answer': u'\nI don\'t know what video you\'re watching, but the usual method involves rewriting that system of equations as an augmented matrix.  Yours could be something like: \n \n[ 3 . 2 | 5 ] \n[-2 . 4 | 9 ] \n \n(I\'ve put x first there,  \n \nThe three types of elementary row operations are: \n(a) multiply each element in a row by the same nonzero value \n(b) exchange any two rows \n(c) add a constant multiple of one row to another \n \nAny of those will produce a new system with exactly the same solution set. \n \nWhat you\'d like to do is get the system in the form: \n \nx = a \ny = b \n \n...which is already solved.  The augmented matrix for that system is: \n \n[ 1 0 | a ] \n[ 0 1 | b ] \n \n...since x=a is the same as 1x + 0y = a, and y=b is the same as 0x + 1y = b. \n \nThat\'s where the "alternating 0 and 1" pattern comes from.  Left of the vertical bars is a square matrix that is 1 on the "main diagonal" from top left to bottom right, and 0 everywhere else.  That particular square matrix is called the "identity matrix", and you\'ll see it a lot later on. \n \nGoing back to your original system, get a 1 in row 1 column 2 by multiplying row 1 by 1/3 (type a row operation): \n \n[ 1 . 2/3 | 5/3 ] . . . . (note, dots are for spacing inside.  Ignore them.) \n[-2 .. 4 . | . 9 .] \n \nThen add 2 times row 1 to row 2 (type c row operation): \n \n[ 1 ... 2/3 | . 5/3 ] \n[ 0 . 16/3 | 37/3 ] \n \nNow column 1 is correct, multiply row 2 by 3/16 to finish it: \n \n[ 1  2/3 | . 5/3 . ] \n[ 0 . 1 . | 37/16 ] \n \n...and finally add -2/3 times row 2 to row 1: \n \n[ 1 0 | . 1/8 . ] \n[ 0 1 | 37/16 ] \n \nSo, x=1/8 and y=37/16 is the solution.

	{'answer': u'\nI guess technically its sexist since u treat women different from men, but.personally I find it sweet and polite u do these things, not sexist.          \nIt\'s just manners. It\'s nice to hear you have some.          \nYour being a gentleman. There should be more guys like you in the world. It\'s not sexist at all. You\'re being polite and sweet for holding the door and giving your seat. You know how to treat a girl right and any girl would be lucky to have you. I never see guys do things the way you do because you actually care what others think of you. You\'re making yourself look better by doing these things! Don\'t let anyone tell you it\'s sexist because it\'s not. If someone tells you that its sexist that you treat a girl better than to men, then how are you suppose to treat men better? You don\'t see a guy giving a seat to another man or hold the door for a man. It\'s not sexist against men because who\'s complaining anyway? I never see a guy cry or get mad if you don\'t give them a seat. I don\'t see why people are calling this sexist. So it\'s not sexist, it\'s just the way you are. Your mom raised you right :D          \nYes.          \nIt\'s called chivalry and no, people are just pathetic now a days and can\'t see that you are being respectful. Not every woman in the world wants to be treated like trash or like "One of the guys" so I don\'t know about other women, but I would find things like that very sweet. \r\nIf it is guys accusing then they are just jealous that they don\'t act that nice, that they weren\'t taught better. If it\'s a girl complaining, it\'s because of these guys who treat them like trash. They don\'t know how to appreciate it after all the bs guys they have been around. \r\nMy suggestion, keep up those things!          \nYes, it is sexist AGAINST males.          \nThe definition of sexist behavior is behavior that involves or fosters sexism, \nand the definition of sexism is one of two things: \n1. attitudes or behavior based on traditional stereotypes of sexual roles.  \n2. discrimination or devaluation based on a person\'s sex, as in restricted job opportunities; especially, such discrimination directed against women. \n \nSo, what you do is most comparable to being considerate or gentlemen like, most women appreciate such actions. From your description, you simply have manners that were misunderstood. It could be considered that you do these things just because our tradition dictates it, which could lean towards sexism, but you were just doing it to be polite.          \nYou just have good manners. \r\n Keep them, and lose the person who told you otherwise.

Nobody has to 'get to' the point of prostitution...          \nNo, my father taught me how to grow a garden, butcher chickens and cook, I wouldnt ever sell myself, I'm not afraid of hard work either          \nI do that every time I go to the job I hate and work 85 + hour weeks. \r\n \r\nSometimes I fantasize at work that I get killed and my family gets my life insurance(this is a good fantasy for me) \r\n \r\nNow I know why men die before women, they want to.          \nI would be delighted to find some one to pay me for my body.          \nits an insult to sell yourself. Even your love ones can use that against you in the future, your degnity is most important.          \nabsolutely i would sell myself to feed my family and my family is my husband my uncle and my three dogs          ",

	{'answer': u'\nheaven won\'t take me.  hell is afraid of me.          \nTrust me, the devil wants me.          \nWatch this video. \r\nMaybe it will provide some answers: \r\n \r\n          \nok... The devil wants as many people with him as he can possibly get.. so he wouldn\'t be kicking anyone out.  \r\nGod gets to decide where you go not Satan cuz we\'re all children of God not Satan.. Satan would be our brother. And I don\'t think they argue over people.. You go where God decides you should be.          \nMy answer is always that people say "fu**ing hell but never fu**ing heven" so I know where I want to go.          \nEven assuming these beings existed, that\'s like asking if the janitor has a say in what Walmart stocks. \r\n \r\nSince the general idea is Yahweh is omnipotent - infinitely powerful, and that the devil is not, then nothing that the devil does or attempts is done eithout Yahweh\'s planning it.  It\'s not even that Yahweh has to approve of it.  Omniopotent means what it says - since Yahweh made all and knows all, everything the devil does is exactly what Yahweh intended.          \nYou\'re omitting one party in the question, and it\'s the deciding party.  Each person decides his/her own eternity by choosing well or badly.  Choose to love God, neighbor, self and creation and you merit heaven.  Choose not to and you condemn yourself to eternal death.  God accepts your decision.  For pete\'s sake don\'t promote the old picture of a mean old God driving you out of paradise.          \nNo, he\'s a subordinate.          \nNo, the devil doesn\'t have a say. He was (and still is as far as I know) an angel, a creation of god.          \nYes actually it;s like  ploitics there are 2 parties with major campaining political ads and much negitive  campaigning going on .. obamma is the anti christ and jesus us being played this week by the pleasent John Tesh ...          \nThey say!

You can check out the ELF website (just google ELF cosmetics) and use the store locater to see if anything is available near you. Hope that helped. I'm also a beauty guru on youtube so if you have the time come check out my channel and let me know what you think! thanks so much! and good luck :)          \nI always use my Collection 2000 Fast Stroke eyeliner, it is usually about \xa32.99. I've used other ones I found cheaper in places like Savers and Bodycare, but they dried too slowly and ended up all over my upper eyelid. The one I use dries quickly, and the applicator looks like a pointed felt tip pen tip rather than a brush, I think it goes on better than ones with a brush. Other glittery eyeliners by Collection 2000 and Miss Sporty dried too slowly, I use the black, brown and blue Collection 2000 Fast Stroke eyeliner, and I have a few similar ones from Avon, but they are a bit hit or miss for the same reasons.          \nBoot's natural collection does some really good stuff!

	{'answer': u"\n200's in 6          \n2000 in 5 \r\n \r\nshaq in his prime is too dominant . howard cant stop him. there frontcourt is kobe nash in prime is deadly. plus the bench is tmac which is the better scorer version of durant IMO. allen iverson carter kg j-kidd was amazing . too much star power.          \nToday's players. Change the question to the 90's though & I'd give you a different answer.          \nEven though the modern day team looks good, 2000 would win, and it would be because of the frontcourt come on, Shaq on Dwight - Shaq, Duncan on Blake - Duncan. And 2003 Tracy McGrady was better than 2008 Paul Pierce.          \n2001 ai is better than kobe 2006. 01 he got MVP, all star mvp, most PPG in reg season and playoffs, most SPG.          \nModern Day!          \n2000's.          \n2000's team would booty rape todays stars          \nI'd have to go with the 2000's, mostly because they're more proven than this current roster.

	{'answer': u'\ni will mirror back something more sexist... \r\n(generally, i am far better at it) \r\n \r\nsometimes.  individuals are different. \r\n \r\nit once was us by a mile, but those gender differences are shrinking every day.          \nI don\'t point it out. \r\nI just downvote them. \r\n \r\nBecause I am a man.          \nSexist to themselves or what?

	{'answer': u"\nYou cannot sign a binding Contract under 18 in the UK., and that is what a rental agreement is. You are still classed as a Minor. \nUK          \nUntil you are 18 will need a guarantor and that is only  if you can find a landlord willing to rent to a minor, which will be extremely difficult. Even once you reach 18 you will still probably need a guarantor until you have a bit of renting history behind you. \nYour 'shouting' wont make the facts any different. You are too young for most landlords to consider  - nothing else to be said.          \nYou might want to do the sums in a bit more detail before doing that typical teenage thing you've just done of throwing a tantrum the moment you don't like what someone says.  \n \nYou can't sign a lease until you are 18 and few landlords will want a child living on their own as the sole occupant.          \nYou aren't mature enough to live alone, as your silly stroppy shout demonstrates.          \nWhat you aren't 'fully aware' of is the law of contract in the UK. As a minor you cannot sign a rental agreement or enter into a rental contract. There are no loopholes either. So the rest of the matter is irrelevant. Hope this doesn't upset you too much.

	{'answer': u'\nyea it seems pretty ridiculous          \nYou have no clue about the Biblical God at all.          \ntrue          \nProverbs 16:25          \nIt reminds me of  a story I wrote when I was about 6 where I constantly rambled and reiterated points and then changed them again.          \nNo, it sounds like a great sci-fi blockbuster movie plot.  In fact, I\'m pretty sure Keanu Reeves played the lead role.          \nIt\'s not as bad as "The Green Slime."  Close, but no cigar. \r\n \r\n          \nIf only you had created the universe you could define all these rules, aww shucks          \nit was good for that children\'s fantasy book.          \nTo be fair, it could be a GOOD B-movie. Let\'s say they got Russell Mulcahy to direct, and Christopher Lee as Satan, Bruce Campbell as Jesus...          \nSci-fi B movies at least usually try to have some kind of coherent plot, with a few action set pieces and usually at least one plucky girlfriend/damsel in distress to maintain interest. \r\n \r\nThe heaven/hell thingie doesn\'t even have that.  There\'s no decent characters.  No dialog.  No love interest.  There\'s not even a scene where the scientist hero finally convinces the authorities that the danger is real, and comes up with some wildly implausible pseudo-science to save the day ("We\'ll spray the aliens with Gatorade!  The electrolytes in the fluid will react with their alien nervous systems, making them overload and explode!!"). \r\n \r\nThere\'s no third act at all - it barely qualifies as an interesting setting, let alone a whole movie. \r\n \r\nThe Killer Shrews is both more believable, and more interesting.          \nit\'s complete crap. \r\n \r\nthe hell and heaven concept. \r\n \r\nwhat i find even more odd that people that believe deeply, say your path is already written for you. \r\nif this is the case then dictators never did have a choose and hell is not \r\njustice. \r\n \r\nit\'s so black and white it hurts the color specter of nature          \nAll have sinned. Sin separates us from God. God sent His Son to die so we don\'t have to be separated from Him. I\'d say He is a loving God.          \nNo need to rant. What if I told you that that was not necessarily the way. There  are others who feel like you and they are Christians. If you want to do more than rant look at this web site. Maybe it can explain a lot for you.           \nI hear what you are saying and I agree with you that there are many good people who are not christians.  There are many that do good and live a Godly life, that do not have faith in the Lord. \r\nGod deals with us individually in different ways, according to the person.    \r\nMost people come to know and love God in God\'s time, not ours.  We have no right to judge and condemn anyone for their actions or how they choose to believe.  This is God\'s department, alone and He needs no help from us. \r\nIf everyone spent as much time in their own affairs as they do in others, well this world would be a whole lot different, wouldn\'t it \r\nI love God with all my heart and I know God loves all of us, with all His heart.  God sends no one to Hell.  He does not wish this on anyone and He will stand by us our whole life, just in case we change our minds about Him.   He gives us every opportunity to acknowledge His love for us, until our moment of passing.          \nMaybe you\'d enjoy exploring the various views about hell.  Your question is geared only toward the firey pit definition.  There is some interesting history surrounding where the word came from and its original use.  You may be surprised by what you discover that is consistent with a loving God.          \nokay \r\n1."god is a loving god" god gave adem and eve a choice to obey god and not eat from the tree of knowledge but saton tempted theM.  god warned them and told them that we would all be damned to hell. but they fell into temtation and we were all supposed to go to die but then god died on the cross for us to SAVE US FROM THE TEMPTATION,sin. he gave us a chance for ourselves to either believe in him or not. so technically if god didnt die for us(which he did it b/c he love us) then wed all be in hell. we ALL deserve to go to hell.even a precious new born is a sinner b/c its human. we have sinful natures. all of us do!  \r\n2"the ones who deserve to go to hell....murders rapists,and etc.whatever u said" SIN IS SIN. NO MATTER IF IT IS SAYING A CUSS WORD OR  RAPIN SOMEONE. they are equal sin...all christians slip us sometimes and we dont think we are better than anybody else. we are equal \r\n \r\ngod never said that life was fair but he did say that everything happenes for a reason. theres a reason im answering.its so simple. what if i as a christian am right and you end up in hell.....dern...thats gonna suck u didnt listen to me.  \r\n \r\n 16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[a] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. \r\n \r\n                                                         jon3:16          \nNot every religion believes that.  I\'m an eclectic Pagan, and I believe that the Gods and Goddesses care more about what you than what you believe.   \r\n \r\nAlso, I believe that people who are not good are given another chance by reincarnation to learn and repay. \r\n \r\nBut the reasons you listed are some of the many why I left Christianity.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    So we\'re born into this world, where we have to choose either to believe in a higher being, God, and if we reject God and refuse to live by his means, we get sent to Hell and burn for eternity with the devil. \r\nDoesn\'t it sound like a sci-fi B movie plot, really?  I think so. \r\n \r\nIt\'s just odd to me that a "loving god" would send people to hell, even if they refuse to live by his standards and love him as he does in return.  It\'s just cruel.  Just because people aren\'t "christians" doesn\'t mean they aren\'t good people, and help others, just because you don\'t believe.. you certainly don\'t deserve hell.  The ones that do deserve hell that are the murderers, rapists, and just overall the cruel people...that\'s justice.  Good hearted people, god loving or not, deserve heaven. \r\n \r\nRant rant rant. Done.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nIf you don\'t accept God\'s love, he has no reason to take you into Heaven.          \nHe wouldn\'t. \r\n \r\nThat is just one part of Christianity that makes no sense. thus making it buying bull.          \nHe tells us in the Bible how to be saved so we don\'t go to hell. He even died for our sins which means He is loving. You have to save yourself and He has told you how and died for you, so if you don\'t want to go to hell, read Acts 2:38.          \nIt\'s not god or anyone else send you to hell, it\'s you and what you believe in that sends you to hell.          \nApparently, not believing in something is enough to sent to be \'hell\', Because that is what love is.          \nNow THAT is what I have been asking for a long while. I used to go to church when I was younger and asked those questions....nobody like it when you ask things like that or use common sense.          \nI always wondered about that myself. But fairytales don\'t always make sense.          \nHell is a pretty big topic that can\'t be covered adequately in one post. I recommend listening to this podcast on the topic "how could a God of love send anyone to hell?":  \r\n \r\nAs for aliens, the Bible doesn\'t say anything about whether there is life on other planets or not. Most Christians would say that there are not, but we cannot rule them out entirely. However, if there are aliens on other planets, then we\'ll find out when we meet them.          \nChristians say that people "choose" to go to Hell, which is palpably absurd.  By their own admission, their God created Hell.  People only go there because He chose to make such a place. \r\n \r\nTheir God is not loving.  He\'s an officious, tyrannical megalomaniac who wants everyone to sing His praises.  There is nothing loving about that.          \ngod is perfect therefore he cannot let imperfectness into heaven. It\'s very simple. Those people who are cleared of their sin through jesus christ are perfect when they get to heaven, it would be unfair to let sinners into heaven so there ya go :)          \nA "loving God" would not. A "loving God" would not have created hell in the first place. \r\n \r\nOnly a jealous, vicious, sadistic, merciless, blood-thirsty \'God" would. \r\n \r\nCitations: \r\n \r\nExodus 34:14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. \r\n \r\nIsaiah  45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things. \r\n \r\nMatthew 10:34 - 37 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man\'s foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.          \nReligion always loses rational arguments.          \nsuck wind - "he doesn\'t. you send yourself to hell. Its ALWAYS been that way." \r\n \r\nI\'ve always loved this argument. \r\n \r\nIf I travel to another country and beat someone within an inch of their life for not sending me a Christmas card, *I* didn\'t beat them up, they beat *themselves* up.          \nHe doesn\'t send any one to hell. Since He is a perfect God, he cannot allow sin, which is imperfection, into heaven. he sent Jesus to take our sin and render us clean, so that we could get into heaven. So he actually wants us to be with Him, and tried to make it fairly easy for us to do so. The problem is that people don\'t believe in Him and simply deny Him. So, since they are still consumed with sin, they make their own choice which, sadly, is hell.          \nHe wouldn\'t, hence this being one of the great logical problems with Christianity.  Don\'t let any of the fundies tell you "you decide to go to hell," as such statements reflect their lack of thought on the issue. \r\n \r\nFor example: \r\n1. God is omnipotent \r\n2. God is good \r\n3. Evil (or hell) exists \r\n \r\nThose three cannot all exist together.  For, if God was omnipotent and good, he would have already driven out evil (not in some future, dramatic, threshing floor end times).  Permitting evil to exist even a little bit right now is evidence that he is not omniscient (actually he doesn\'t exist, so all of this is academic speculation).          \nGod created the world so that we would worship him. If he just removed Hell there would be no motive to worship him because Christians and non-Christians would have the same fate. God gives you a chance to turn yourself around so that you don\'t HAVE to go to Hell. If you choose not to, you\'re on your own.          \nYour first answer is the standard argument. It requires that someone be confused enough to think we can have free will while God also knows what we will do before he "creates" us.  \r\n \r\nA loving being would not even create a hell, much less send anyone there.          \nJesus said "if you deny me on earth, I will deny you before my Father in heaven." \r\n \r\nif you deny God, what makes you think you have any kind of right to be in heaven with Him? also, if you don\'t believe, why would you want to be anywhere with anyone whom you don\'t believe in or have faith in?  \r\n \r\nyou to have your cake and eat it too. you either accept God or reject God and then deal with the consequences that follow.  \r\n \r\nit doesn\'t work that way.          \nGod is NOT sending people to hell. People are sending themselves to hell. God doesn\'t like it when people go to hell, it hurts God and make him unhappy. Its your choice if you go to heaven or hell.          \nEvery single person on earth deserves Hell. We are sinners and that\'s what we deserve. God gave his only son so that we could all have a choice. We can decide for ourselves weather or not we want to go to heaven or hell. God is not Sending anyone to hell. We do that ourselves. God is a Merciful God. He wants us to serve him, and our reward for doing that is heaven. He\'s not condemning us to Hell, but wanting us in heaven. I hope this helps you. :)          \nHe doesn\'t send you to hell. You do that all on your own. If God didn\'t give us choice, we\'d all be robots with no love or emotions at all. If God "removed" hell, then we would obviously all end up in heaven, and in heaven you worship Jesus for all of eternity. He isn\'t going to MAKE you worship him, so you wouldn\'t even want to be in heaven unless you truly loved him.          \nHell is punishment. Jesus does love you and wants you to love and believe in Him. If you don\'t then you recieve your eternal punishment. As for "Satan torturing people in hell", read the Book of Revelation and see what happens to Him.          \nThere is no life, literally no life, outside of God.  Whatever it is that is outside of God, we call hell.          \nSee God is a complex and confusing subject. the bible says we are terrible sinners and god made hell for sinners. But it also says he sent his son to die on the cross. It says he\'s merciful but sometimes I get confused on the god stuff. Christians don\'t believe in aliens, well at least 97%. Few do and believed there could be other creatures but God loved them as well. Alot of Christians say Christianity was always in the beginning and its not a sect from Judaism but that doesn\'t make sense.  \r\n \r\nIts in the Bible that Jesus was the Kings of Jews. Plus, Gods says everyone is a sinner so it wouldn\'t matter if they were Jewish, Hindu, or Bhuddist          \nSome people are arbitrary in how they define words. One of my friends said that in a child\'s story, someone said, "A word will mean just whatever I choose it to mean!" Such is the case with Christians. It is hardly a "loving deity" who would burn billions of people forever for such a trivial matter as not believing in him. I do not care what ants believe, and if gods exist, we are ants to them. If he wanted people to believe in him, he would have shown us some proof he exists, rather than giving us such a poorly-written book as the Bible that has so many silly contradictions and so much ignorance of reality. If the Bible was really the word of a deity, such a deity would be as ignorant as the ancient Hebrew shepherds who began the Bible, or he would be a psychotic demon who wants any feeble excuse at all to torture billions of his creations forever. Logic shows us the truth of the matter. Primitive Hebrews obviously wrote the first books of the Bible, and they tried to scare people to make them do as they wanted. From my observation, some Christians believe space aliens exist, but others say the universe was created only for humans.          \nWhy would a potter use one pot to preserve jewels in it and use another as a dust bin? \r\n \r\nWhy do you write tests & exams? \r\n \r\nWhy should a company choose to recruit you when compared to others? \r\n \r\nGod could have controlled you & me like rocks & mountains. Why did he give us the freedom to decide what we liked to do? He should have made us like robots. \r\n \r\nSimple, It is a qualification test. A company has so many levels of strict interviews and eligibilities  to recruit someone to become a employee (partner) in the goal of earning profit. \r\n \r\nHow much more strict should the king of kings be inorder to recruit people for his kingdom. God has His own guidelines that He strictly adheres to. Life on Earth is to be sifted like gold. Its not that very easy task to please the supreme.  \r\n \r\nBut the good news is there is a Way. Its not impractical however. You can WIn          \nYou have to understand that upon creating all that mankind is aware of God had first created the ratio between negative and positive. hell is less considered a punishment but more rather a place of purification from the evil which has stained your soal.  \r\nIts the same idea of people facing justice among our society....you think it would make sense for a murder to be acquainted with his victim in heaven with the same corruption within his heart.. \r\n....just becasue your parents punish you for your wrong does not mean they dont love you but that they love you enough to not see you follow a corrupted path.          \nHell doesn\'t exist....though it sure does feel like it on earth sometimes! \r\n \r\nOK, god doesn\'t exist but if you want to believe this bullcrap....god created evil: Isaiah 45:7 and he created Satan. \r\n \r\nSatan\'s only crime was to rebel evil....hence "god"! \r\n \r\nTherefore GOD IS EVIL! \r\nStop worshiping such an atrocity as the LIAR god!          \nFlush law (sin and death) as dung, and hell vanishes. \r\nPoof goes the dragon instead of puff goes the dragon.

	{'answer': u'\nI personally think it is too much information.  I think people want short and sweet.  You should tell them about the ages you accept, the times you are available and your experience.  You don\'t want to sound desperate.  Then when they call and ask about the Daycare, then you provide them with all of the other information.   Most people just want the facts not all that other information.  Too much and they won\'t read it.          \nYou have way to much information here and you need someone to edit this for grammar and punctuation. You also do not want to advertise that someone has watched up to 12 infants at one time; I would never leave my child with someone who is irresponsible enough to think they can care for that many babies at once, they even have a law about it for home day cares.          \nFirst, this may be just me but I would not respond to your ad even though you have a lot to offer. You typing every word in a cap makes it hard for me to read and I made myself so I could answer. Your spelling is bad, usage of language incorrect. That again may just bother me but if you are teaching my children its my issue. \r\n \r\nThe CAPS, yuck \r\nYou write "Just Let Me No ", it would be, just let me \'know" \r\nyou write Home Day CAre At are house , that should be \' at our house" \r\nYou use are instead of our several times. \r\n \r\nIt may be that english is a second language for you so these things do get confusing.  If you could get someone to sit and proof read with you I think you could set up some business. \r\nI have done this and would advise that you are offering a litte ahead of what you need to deliver. Set up a business then expand.  \r\nYou need set hours at first, say 6am to 6pm. Do not offer over night or extended care until you are set and stable. Do not offer out call, baby sitting services. You are running a day care not a sitter service. If you go to homes then there is no assistance at the home. Unless you go after hours on your own. \r\nYou will need to have two people in the home at all times.  \r\nAlso posting on Craigs list means you\'ll have to get a license I read. That may be wrong but if you offer a business from home you will need a license to care for more than a couple of kids. \r\nGood luck here, I hope it works for you. \r\nJust go slow so the promblems of start up are easy to overcome.          \nI have been a licensed child care provider in my home in Michigan for 21 years.  I actually am not exactly sure what your question is, but I am going to assume you are wanting to know if your Craig\'s List posting is a good ad.  What you have written here sounds OK, but it does contain several spelling errors which makes it a bit difficult to read.  It also seems to go on and on making it a bit hard to follow.  If I were looking for an in-home child care and saw an ad that said the care givers would come to the family\'s home, I\'d probably skip over your ad since you can\'t provide care in your home in addition to going to someone else\'s home.  No one could be in 2 places at one time.  I, personally, have never even looked at Craig\'s List and I don\'t do any advertising for my daycare on that site.  I find local, word of mouth exposure keeps me as busy as I\'d like to be.  If Craig\'s List is the only place you\'ve put out the word and you aren\'t getting any calls than it is time to expand your advertising.  First, if you are a licensed facility check into organizations such as Child Care Network that works with licensed centers and home and helps match up those with openings with families needing care.  If you aren\'t licensed, this may be a problem for some people, especially if your state requires a license.  In Michigan, if you regularly care for an unrelated child in your home you must be licensed through the state.  Each state sets their own daycare regulations, though.  You should also spread the word by telling your friends, family, neighbors, church office, local elementary schools, local pediatrician offices, etc. that you are doing daycare.  Post ads in places were moms go like the laundrymat, the grocery store, and any other public bulletin boards you have in your area.  You also need to consider the economic climate currently in our country.  Many areas are hard hit by closing businesses which is leaving many families with only one working parent thus elminating the need for daycare.  Even if both parents have managed to keep their jobs, they may very well know a close friend or family member who lost their job so they withdraw their children from daycare and pay their friend or family member to care for the children to help them out.  Nearly all the home daycare providers I know are down in their enrollment and several have gone out of business.  Most daycare centers are also down in enrollment in our area.  I have not received a call inquiring about daycare openings since before Christmas when usually I get about 2-3 per month.  If you spread the word about your daycare and don\'t receive any calls, my guess is going to be that your area is struggling economically, too, and there just aren\'t any families in need of daycare at this time.          \ni would check your spelling and grammar;  there are many mistakes in there, and for what you are offering i would expect you to be a little more educated.  lack of spelling and grammar skills shows lack of education...just my opinion.          \nIf you need to include all of this information you will need to do a spell/grammer check.  Your use of caps makes it very hard to read.  Your usage of words just in the additional details edit are simple mistakes that are easy to fix.  example: To Much Info -should be Too much info....      Have Tryed That - should be have tried that......    It is little mistakes like this that could be critical to potential clients.  People judge on the material content as well as how it is presented - your first impression just with the errors would be a turn-off for me as a parent, regardless of what the information contains.          \nOh my goodness way to much info at once.I wouldn\'t even read it all.It seems like your trying to hide something so your putting so much info and adding all these things you do.Not that you are I\'m sure your great people but,as a parent I\'d think your trying to hard.Also I didn\'t like how you said you can call are cell.I think It be better if you\'d say you may contact us at such and such.Also you shouldn\'t say my home or your home because It\'s either you have  daycare openings at your house or your looking for a job to watch kids at there house.Also how you typed it make is as if you are screaming.I\'m not trying to be mean I just want you to know how i[\'d feel as a parent.Since you wanted the truth right?Good luck just try to keep it simple then you can meet them face to face to tell them the great things you offer.Try to go over your grammar and spell check because parents can get really crazy about that.If they hire you to teach there children then they are going to see how you grammar and all that is.Believe me i can\'t write for anything as you can see lol.Some people are very crucial about that.Just spell check or ask someone to help go over it with you.That\'s what i do.Best wishes hope you get what you want.

Typically any waterproof liquid will stay on without smudging. \r\nI'm kind of weird. I use liquid on the top and pencil on the bottom.          \nAlmay's liquid eyeliner works really, really, reallyyy good. It doesn't smudge and it stays on all day.

	{'answer': u'\nput it on a flash drive..... who the heck uses discs anymore.... its like using VHS lmao \n \na .iso file is a "disc image" its basically a digital disc. it works identically to a disc, but is a file on your computer. (there is also software like deamon tools which allows you to actually run the .iso like a real disc from your computer aswell. so you can rip a dvd game disc to .iso and then use deamon tools to install the game from a .iso, since it will think its a disc in a disc drive.) \na .iso be be burned to an actual disc, or put on a usb flash drive or usb hdd. \n \nubuntu can be installed to your hdd from a dvd or flash drive or usb hdd, or you can run it as a "live cd" and jsut run the os directly from the .iso file from the storage device.          \nDoes Ubuntu run on notebooks? \n \nI think Ubuntu does run on notebooks. You would need to use a USB Jump Drive, or USB Flash Drive with Ubuntu on it.          \nAs long as you have 1GB of RAM and 9 GB of storage space you should be able to install Ubuntu.

	{'answer': u'\nDaft Punk; they took electronic music and modified it into something both soulful and electronic. Thus making it pop music.          \nThere are ton of artists that have marked the history of the music,  \nlike Neil Young, Les Paul \nThose two have made a difference in the music. \n \nFor example: Les Paul was the first one to plug an electric guitar and he could make a system where you could record one instrument at the time when all the band had to play at the same time to record the song  \nNeil Young practically created a new genre and he is called the godfather of the Grunge          \nThe answer to that question will depend on the age of the responder.  Elvis & the Beetles have long been touted as the greatest of ALL time; yet both of them were influenced by somebody else that I\'ve never heard of!!!  Personally, I love Stevie Ray Vaughan & he stated that he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix; yet, I don\'t care much for Hendrix\'s music!!!  Michael Jackson was also known to be a great talent; but he\'s another who didn\'t appeal to me!!!  My Grandmother was a huge Frank Sinatra fan; but we don\'t hear much of his music unless Michael Buble is on the air.  Buble is know for being a good artist...NOT a great artist.  Generations taste in music change from one to the next; so, I\'m NOT convinced that there is any ONE person who I\'ve ever heard of that has had the MOST impact!!!  IF I had to pick ONE, I would say it was the very FIRST person who ever sang the first song because their influence spread from there until now!!!          \nI hate to say this but Justin Beiber has had a massive influence. If not on music, then on how the up and coming generation sees it. The amount of screaming 9 year olds that know everything about him but not Freddie Mercury seem to be the majority. It\'s not a good thing, but that\'s the way the media wants to sell it. \n \nIt will probably bring about temporary death of good music until there\'s another music rebellion like in the 1950\'s.          \nNiccol\xf2 Paganini. \nLike a lot of classical musicians, he lived in a music world where everything was about music. Therefore able to create impressive fingerings on the violin rather than just following traditional ways of fingering.  \n \nBut a lot of the older classical musicians were impressive. Their works lasted centuries and will continue to last for a very long time.          \nAfter considerable thought and eliminating several contenders, my opinion is that J\xa0S\xa0Bach may have had the greatest influence.\xa0 He developed counterpoint virtually single-handedly from its crude predecessors.\xa0 He solved all the basic problems in composition, and modern composers, in the first years after they learn their craft, frequently turn to Bach to "see how he did it". \n \nHe\'s largely responsible even for how we tune our instruments to make complex music playable.\xa0 Previously, the pitches in the tuning system were based on simple ratios devised by ancient Greeks, called "just intonation", which allowed playing in single keys.\xa0 For example, an instrument tuned for C would sound fine played in that key, but unpleasant played in E. \n \nFor wind and non-fretted sting instruments, where adjusting pitch is possible, the players eliminate the problem.\xa0 For fixed-fret and keyboard instruments, however, this is not option, and retuning is necessary to play in another key. \n \nBach championed "equal temperament" tuning, in which notes are tuned very slightly lower or higher than just intonation would call for, evenly distributing the tuning discrepancies to make possible all keys on fixed-pitch instruments. \n \nThese pitch adjustments are built into electronic instruments, and accomplished on guitar and similar instruments by relocating the frets very slightly from their "ideal Greek" single-key placements.\xa0 Without equal temperament, modern pop and classical music is simply not practicable\xa0\u2014\xa0you could play it, but you wouldn\'t want to hear it.          \nPatti and Mildred J. Hill, the composers of the melody for "Happy Birthday to You".          \nBritish Invasion, 80\'s New Wave/Punk, then rap... There\'s alot. Depending on time and opinion.          \n\u3000 Now you did ask of Musician only, not plural, or bands or groups, and that changes some attributes to whom we think is our favorite, to who may be most well known attributed artists in the field,  \n \n\u3000 What we miss out on overall , is someone like Beethoven, where without many a written song by him has been keyed upon many thereafter,  \n \nLudwig van Beethoven \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 Thereafter, It would then be individuals alike Elvis and Micheal Jackson,  \n \nElvis Presley \n \nMicheal Jackson,  \n \n \n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u266b \u2740 \u270d  \n \n\u3000 The list can be longer than any one individual applicable, even unknowns to us from other parts of the world,  \n \nGlenn Miller , Lawrence Welk , Paul McCartney, Elton John,  \nEric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Eminem, Bob Marley, ... \n \n..          \nMany people consider Paul McCartney the most successful artist of all time, due to the level of popularity his songs co-written with John Lennon have achieved, as well as the amount of singers who have covered his song \'Yesterday\', though many would perhaps stick with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or Ludwig van Beethoven, all of them popular in their day and nowadays.          \nObviously the honor should probably go to one of the early classical composers.  However, unless you are a musical historian it would be difficult and too far removed from recent history for the average person to contemplate.  In recent time I would have to say Elvis Presley, even though there are many musicians whom I prefer.  The majority of people within the past half-decade listened to either rock, country, jazz or gospel.  Elvis was the first to take the fledgling genre of rock and combine it with elements of most other genres.   He was among the first to use electric guitar within his band as the backbone to his music.  He was definitely the first  musician of high popularity to incorporate energized movements into his performance.  He also had a wide appeal to people of varying race and musical taste.   Almost all subsequent rock or pop musicians cited him as among their earliest influence.   Twenty years from now most of the nation\'s or world\'s populace won\'t know a clue about current names on the charts.  However, I am certain that even a century and more from now Elvis will still be known (and he might even still have a few \'impersonators\' in Vegas.)       \n \nElvis:  the very first rock-n-roll \'star\'          \nMichael Jackson, thats all i have to say.          \nOwl City  \nEDIT: 4 dislikes? what do people have against Adam? His music is amazing.  \n          \nScott Joplin had the most impact on popular music as a whole. He was one of the first musicians to incorporate syncopation into music. Doctors of the late 1800s and early 1900s thought syncopation was unhealthy and could cause irregular heart palpitations. Obviously that was proved wrong. \n \nThere\'s no popular song today without some syncopation in it. Scott Joplin (also known as the "King of Ragtime") wrote many famous rags that many people could recognize today, like "Maple Leaf Rag" and "The Entertainer." Ragtime gave rise to Jazz, which gave rise to Rock and Roll, which gave rise to Hip Hop, which gave rise to 99% of today\'s popular music. \n \nIn my opinion, Scott Joplin is the unsung hero of popular music.          \nElvis Presley.He brought people together.He helped to transform basic blues and gospel music and took it to the masses.He had one of the best voices in history.A remarkable vocal range. \nMost of all he made it believable that a kid from an ordinary background could make it.A huge influence on virtually every pop/rock artist since.          \nHiphop now some hiphop I hate. Snoopdog some of his songs are cool. Hiphop express all types of feelings anger, happy, sad, and etc.          \nGive me thumbs down, but i like one direction...          \nJimi Hendrix but I have to agree with LadyMarisaa too          \nMy favourite solo artist is Michael Jackson as far as I\'m concerned nobody can or will ever touch his vocal ability or his stagecraft he (in my opinion) was the greatest solo artist ever. As for favourite band there are so many bands that i love to choose from but i have to say Guns N Roses (1986-1996 line-ups) they were the first band i heard when i actually started listening to music when i was about 5 years old and I first heard "Welcome to the Jungle" and I was hooked been a gunner ever since and will be till i die (now that\'s devotion lol)          \ndefintly michial jackson          \n3pac \n \n \n \nHe doesn\'t give a hoot.          \nWhen you consider music it would largely rule out people like Elvis and Michael Jackson as they are not predominantly musicians - singers, performers, entertainers. \n \nFor a real answer I would pick someone like Antonio Stradivarius for making violins which hundreds of years later are still individually and collectively considered to be the greatest instruments ever made. \nOther than him the great composers like Beethoven whose music is still played today and have inspired great music still being produced for movies today. \nI like the other answerer who said J.S. Bach. \n \nFor more modern influences on music I would pick someone like Elvis or John Lennon.          \nI\'m going to have to go with the classical musicians, specifically the likes of Beethoven and Pachelbel.          \nI\'ll name a few: \nJohnny Cash, Bob Marley, and Gordon Lightfoot. \n \nGordon Lightfoot because his talent of writing songs has inspired my ability to be able to do that. \n \nBob Marley because his music reached deep into my roots to re-aquaint me of my black heritage and struggles. \n \nJohnny Cash because like Marley, his music created a lot of social consciousness in me, plus when I was a kid and I was suffering from a lot of deep problems, listening to Johnny Cash\'s prison songs really helped me so I can learn about the meaning of redemption from living the low life.          \nThe answer above about J.S. Bach championing the equal temperament tuning is a really good one, but to confine my answer to modern times I would say Phil Spector. Better known as a producer, he was a musician first, so I think he still qualifies.  \n \nOver his career he produced songs and albums for some big pop acts such as The Ronnettes, Tina Turner, The Beatles Let It Be album, The Ramones, John Lennon, Leonard Cohen, and The Righteous Brothers. \n \nNot only was the sound he brought to these songs hugely influential, he is a source of some really wild stories of what takes place behind the scenes in the music industry.          \nBackstreet Boys \n \nThey influenced boy bands to give it a shot. One Direction could have been dumb if BSB didn\'t create this boy band madness. And their harmonization is excellent.          \nJustin Bieber and One Direction! <33333333 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665          \nI especially agree with Me2 and teandbikkies.  \nHowever there is one that is over looked. This is the one that brought the magical reverbarations of the electric base guitar into the souls of young people in the early 50\'s. Others had great acts and music, but Duane Eddy (Artistic Name) Whailed out with what was till then only a minor undeveloped instrument.          \nSome bands that have greatly influenced music: \n \n1. The Beatles \n2. Elvis \n3. Jimi Hendrix   \n4. Stevie Ray  \n5. Eric Clapton \n6. Queen \n6. Alice in Chains \n7. Pearl Jam                        \n8. Stone Temple Pilots \n9. Ray Charles \n10. Little Richard \n11. Bob Dylan \n12. The Rolling Stones \n13. Bob Marley \n14. Led Zepplin  \n15. Pink Floyd \netc.  \n \nSome of these artist were true pioneers and creators of Rock n Roll, Grunge, Reggae, etc. \nThese bands are LEGENDS forever their names written in gold. To all the clueless people: \nDaft Punk and One Direction are far from legends, never will be, and can\'t hold a candle to these artists. No offense, but such a comment is so off the mark it\'s laughable.  \n \nThese artists created music for the sake of music. Not a quick buck. They didn\'t pander to the music industries, or the population. They made music straight from the heart and soul. Passion, Aggression, Emotion, that is music.          \ndefintly michial jackson          ',

	{'answer': u'\nWhen puppies are young and still with their litter mates. They play rough together until one of them yelps, that\'s their signal of saying they where biting too hard. This is how puppies learn. But since she isn\'t with her litter mates she doesn\'t realize how hard she is biting. A high pitched squeak should make her realize she is hurting, then stop playing with her for 5 minutes. But after that you can resume. If this squeak shows her that your being submissive, which usually doesn\'t happen, and she becomes dominant. A firm "No." then stop playing for 5 minutes should make her realize that was wrong. If she continues to bite, or bark after you stop playing. Ignore her until she stops. But eventually she will get the idea, and playing will still be great! Enjoy your puppy.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nIt&#x27;s sad to say this but a lot of people experience what you are experiencing now. It&#x27;s simply because people change A LOT while growing up. I&#x27;ve only kept in touch with only one friend I grew up with. Sometimes I miss my friends from the past but they are long gone...we are not alike anymore :&#x2F;          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I have this friend that was my best friend for the past couple of years. In the beginning, me and her hung out all of the time and it was really fun. She has a really loud personality, and she gets really annoying a lot of the time but that\'s why I loved her. After a couple years, we got into a fight. I asked her if she could make sure I was doing okay at school because I was really depressed since my dad had kicked me out. Instead that day she paid all of her attention on my ex boyfriend. At first I got mad at her for flirting with him, and she got mad at me for it. Later on I realized that I wasn\'t upset because she was flirting with him, but more because I had asked her to help me out and she didn\'t. I apologized for getting so mad, (which I sorta regret now) and we moved past it. But she stopped paying attention to me, and she literally shoves me out of the way to be all buddy buddy and cuddly with her other friends. Which is okay, it just sucks when she treats me so shitty. But then we hang out, and it\'s like nothing ever happened, like I\'m her best friend and she\'s mine. At school however, she ignores me a lot. Not all of the time, but she definetly treats me differently. A couple months ago, she said, "You know, I don\'t know whether you\'re waaay below all my friends, or above." That was probably the most inconsiderate thing she had ever said to me, and that was sort of the last straw. After that I stopped trying to hang out with her and stopped making effort.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nThe indefinite for England is not relevant. USA and Jamaica are two different countries who do not care about your indefinite for England. \n \nYou must ask the airline/travel company/whoever organised the flight to Jamaica to tell you exactly what the arrangements are for connecting in the US. While most EU airports have a separate "airside" area (where you can stay between planes), most US airports do not have that. So you would be forced to enter the USA through Immigration and Customs, and would have to have a visa. And of course you will have to have a visa for Jamaica.          \nIf you have a British passport no, you have a visa waiver form to fill out in the US. \nIf a Jamaican passport then you will need a visa even for an in transit visit. \nEnglish visitors do not need a visa to enter Jamaica.

	{'answer': u"\nAir Jamaica was sold to Caribbean Airlines a while back.  So all of the Air Jamaica planes became Caribbean Airlines property.  Many planes still have the Air Jamaica logo though because it's still a separate airline, it's just operated by Caribbean Air (headquarters in Trinidad and Tobago).  The Jamaica government only owns 16% of the shares now, and the headquarters for Air Jamaica is still in Kingston.   \n \nThere is a long story about private investors and then privatizing the airline but in the end I believe it all had to do with financial issues between the airline and the Jamaican government.   \n \nYou can read about it here:           ",
	 'question': u'\n    I go to Jamaica Approximately every two years. I live in Boston so I sometimes have to Stopover in South Florida. Sometimes I go to JFK. Either way, My last trip in 2012, I saw Air Jamaica (Half white, half colored) in Fort Lauderdale/FLL. I wasn\'t paying attention when I landed in Kingston in 2012, even when I was going back home, I wasn\'t really paying attention to the planes out the window when I was upstairs at Kingston\'s Airport. This time my most latest visit to Jamaica, I saw Caribbean Airlines taking off in front of the plane I was in. (To my remembrance, I took JetBlue in 2012 ((BOS-FLL-KIN)), JFK-KIN 2014). When I landed in Kingston I was talking to this Jamaican lady next to me and she said, She\'ll never ride with "Air Jamaica" anymore, Jamaicans have this Hostility towards Trinidadians and started to have a war with them because they bought out the national pride of Jamaica. Anyways, when I was upstairs in Kingston\'s Airport this time, I noticed there was a Caribbean 737 and my JetBlue A320 and some other Private Jets. I asked my mom when I got back, she said "Ha! Air Jamaica sold out, COMPLETELY" Then she kissed her teeth in anger.  ',

Lots of locals will offer, but they might try to rip you off once they see your wallet.  Not a great idea.          \nHaha, you are so naive its not even funny. Don't get upset when something happens to you because you put your self in danger.          \nTHEY SMOKE SO MUCH OF IT OUTSIDE ON BEACHES ETC LITERALLY EVERYWHERE YOU CAN JUST SIT DOWNWIND.I DON'T SMOKE BUT I WAS GETTING A CONTACT HIGH.IT'S EVERYWHERE.          \nkeep your bail $$ on you          \nThe folks would know if you smoke a cigarette and grass is a lot stronger smelling then that, not to mention the high you might get.  If you are bound and determined to smoke, the best thing would be to use this trip to scout out the area so you can return with a bundle of cash (for bail/bribes) without the parents on the next trip.  Of course, on the next trip also have the name of a couple good Jamaican lawyers along with contact information for the folks and someone to get you out of jail as soon as possible (cause you don't want to spend even 1 hour there).

	{'answer': u"\nDelta.  Keep supporting the American company and employees- but look at the times they depart- airlines book flights together and although it is the same plane each airline uses a different flight number- they call this codeshare.

	{'answer': u'\nWell I prefer Air jamaica because they are very carefull about the planes condition before taking off. So yeah they do have delays most of the time.          \nwell they used to be good but started to fall apart about 2 or 3 years ago..now their flights are always delayed..half the time they give ur seats to other people even though u paid it..nice people but so much organized..barely anyone goes on their airlines anymore(not even jamaicans)..u will see about 15-25 people in there...my advice is next time you take spirit..its way better and cheaper..          \ni think the only reason like someone said above me is that they try to make their flight safer and they dont trust me they dont let other peeps take ur seat only if u miss ur flight so dont worry cuz thats what im taking in this month air jamica to montego bay          \nAir Jamaica is the only airplane that is still giving free food. Other airlines like American Airlines make you pay. \r\n \r\n\u2606 Mixed Curly Fries \u2606 \r\n(\\__/)  \r\n(=\'.\'=) \u2665 \r\n(")_(")          \nHavnt you ever heard of Jamaica time?  besides they are a great airline--you cant please everyone all the time.          \nThe service on Air Jamaica is really good, the only downfall is that they have flight delays all the time. They usually arent extremely late though.          \nMy wife is Jamaican and insists we used Air Jamaica the first few times we went.  (never had a crash yadayad  yada.)  So like other said they have had more and more delays.  Last time was the worst.  Call night before telling us the flight was cancalled and we had to take a diiferent flight. 2hrs earlier or 2 hrs later.   We took the ealier, whaich was the first flight our of JFK that day, then it was delayed an hour.  And had to stop in Montego Bay, when we were flying to Kingston. We get off the plan because they said we were switching plans, only to fine out we would get back on the same plan.  Only half full with half of those people in Air Jamiaca out fits sitting in the bussiness class and taking up almost all the overhead compartments.  On they way back it was the worst trip for me on a airline ever.  First it was delayed and hr, then another 1 and a half and finally yet another hr.  It was so bad that while sitting at the airport to leave we were losing time.  There was no weather issue or anything.  This was what should be our last trip on the airline.  we are flying Delta next week.          \nPersonally, I wouldn\'t fly Air Jamaica if they GAVE me a ticket.  We go to Jamaica at least once a year and tried to remain faithful to Air Jamaica.  However, after a work stoppage that resulted in our being stranded on the tarmac for hours, mechanical problems that resulted in a 2 day delay in our return, lost baggage and very poor customer service I have finally given up.  Never, no matter how extreme the situation has the airline offered so much as an apology (other than the flight crew).  No more for me.          \ncustoms has nothing to do with the airline. air jamaica is one of the best and safest airline but they are usually late. the pilots and the hostesses are extremely warm and friendly. u will enjoy travelling on that airline.          \nI just got back from Negril Jamaica and flew with Air Jamaica this is the first time I have ever experience something so scary in my LIFE. The plane landing gear did not come down to do the proper landing, so the plane circled  around Mo bay and Lucea unit the pilot got the heads up to land the plane. Basically we had to do a emergency landing, very scary.  Good lucky with Air JA!          ',

	{'answer': u"\nDONT DO IT !! Any form of drug inside you whilst there is a baby is unnatural and CAN have effects on the baby!! Each baby is different, therefore differnt things would affect it's progression in uterus.          \nI think it's wrong and selfish to smoke ANYTHING while pregnant. Yes the tobacco in it might harm your baby so why take the risk? There are tons of other ways to have fun while pregnsnt then getting high and harming your baby.          \nMy mom said she smoked weed a few times during the 1st trimester with me.. \r\nI don't think it had any effect on me.  \r\nBut i wouldn't do it if I was pregnant.Just because.          \nIf you can't stop until after you have the baby, then you're pretty selfish and put yourself above your child. Any kind of drugs in your system is bad for the baby. \r\n \r\nDon't do it.          \nWell I think you just answered you own question. \r\n \r\nWhy would you smoke anything while pregnant?  I would not smoke cigarettes let alone a drug that hasn't been fully studied during pregnancy. \r\n \r\nAs a mother you should want to keep your baby as safe as possible.  So if that means you forgo something you like for 9 months to do all you can to protect your child like giving up all smoking, drinking etc then you should do it.          \nThere are no proven facts that the baby would be harmed by smoking weed. It's not suggested though. I'm pregnant & personally I quit as soon as I found out I was pregnant just because I don't want to take the chances of harming my baby.  \r\nThe main issue with smoking weed while pregnant, is most doctors offices make you pee in a cup at every appt. and they will see the THC in your system. If there is THC in your system upon the baby being born, the state would be notified and they will take your baby away. \r\nSo, NO I wouldn't do it, because I couldn't live with the fact that my child was taken away due to my stupid habits.          \nThere is not reason to keep smoking weed once a women finds out she's pregnant. And if she says it's because of morning sickness, well almost all pregnant women have morning sickness and deal with it. so why can't she. Pregnancy should be a very happy time no matter if she is sick or not. And she should do anything for the good health of her baby, whether she wants to or not, and I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to. If she can't handle what comes with pregnancy, then she isn't ready to be pregnant. Smoking weed while pregnant comes with nothing but excuses of why they are doing it. No real reason to continue smoking. If one can't not stop smoking for 9 months, then what about the next 18 years of being a mother. Weed is not addictive. therefore you can stop anytime you want. And I know that for a fact. also smoking weed while pregnant will result in low birth weight. I don't see how anyone would want to or need to feel high when pregnant, it should be a joyful time. Just think about it, would you smoke a joint with your kids? So, why smoke when they are inside of you.          \nIt's a proven fact that cannabis affects the unborn child causing low birth weight and development. This is because cannabis reduces the oxygen supply to the placenta. Your choice but please don't expect tax payers to support your special needs child caused by your actions.          \nWeed doesnt have tobacco in it first of all.... I use to smoke weed and with my first pregnancy i knew I was going to abort so I did I am now pregnant again and I would never dream of it.... \nAn old friend of mine smoked weed throughout both of her pregnancies.... and her kids are slow.... they could have been alot smarter but they dont stand a chance since she smoked weed. \n \n Not to mention that puts THC in your babies body and when the babies born they will be cranky due to going through withdrawls from no longer having the THC          \nIt's a disgrace to even concider it. Hell you want to give your baby the best chances of a good healty life so why the hell would you wana spoke weed. It will cause all sorts of problems. Stop being a selfish ***** and think of that life growing inside of you and give it a chance to have a healty life          \nWhy would you ask yahoo these idiots don&#x27;t know right from left you wanna get some real knowledge go and ask your doctor          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I'm not saying its wrong or right but I'd like to know people's views on smoking cannabis while pregnant.

	{'answer': u"\nThis happens to lots of women. I was about 10 weeks before I knew I was pregnant, I drank and smoked weed and cigarettes. \r\nAs long as you have stopped now, it will probobly be ok. Tell your doctor.          \nWell of course its bad for the baby. But its better to stop now then to not stop at all. The more u smoke the worse it can be for your baby.          \nWell as long as you stop now, you should be fine.  Don't worry too much, a lot of times it happens like that.  I found out I was pregnant and a week and a half before I found out, I was out with some friends and had a lot to drink.  I didn't know.  I told my doctor and he said it was fine, it was so early and it's not like I was drinking and getting drunk everyday.  Just make sure you stopped now, and talk to your doctor about it.  I am sure everything is fine. \r\n \r\nGood Luck:)          \nSTop smoking anything! .. PERIOD!          \nUnfortunately, it is bad for the baby. If you have stopped smoking completely, then that is exactly what you should be doing for the sake of your baby.          \nIt's not good for the baby, but you can't get in a time machine and change it now.  All you can do now is look forward and strive to make this a very healthy and safe pregnancy.  No more drugs.  Take a vitamin.  Stay fit.  Eat well.  Read some books.  Get ready.          \nI've heard that it doesn't cause birth defects besides low birth weight.The main concern with smoking anything is that it causes early miscarriage. but it depends on how much you smoked and how far along you are. best thing is to tell you dr. that you are a heavy smoker and he will monitor  your hcg and do an u/s to see if the pregnancy is progressing right.           \nrelax and take a chill pill...your baby is fine just stop smoking now...weed is a natural herb unless u been lacing it with something else...tell your doctor about this though so they can check for any abnormalities...but when i was pregnant with my daughter i was smoking and when i found out i was pregnant i was already 3 month along b/c my periods were always on and off...she is perfectly fine no harm done...again stop doing it now though. good luck.          \nsimple!!! Dont smoke it again while you are pregnant :)           \nStop now.  Your baby should be fine but you need to stay away from things like weed and alcohol and start taking care of yourself.          \ntell a doctor try and get ready, like take classes or medications to stop the addictions.          \nIt's horrible for the baby, but the best thing to do is stop now. There's nothing you can do about the past few weeks, so don't beat yourself up about it. Just do what you can at this point, which is stop smoking.          \nYou should not worry about what you did in the past.  Many mothers did similar things before they found out they were pregnant and there kids turned out just fine.  You did not know that you are pregnant and the past is the past.  Just be sure that you do not do it anymore as it is not good for the baby.  The 1st 3 months is very critical for the fetus.  And you should not do any weed or anything that can harm the baby for the remainder of the pregnancy and while you breastfeed.  Good luck and congratulations.          \nfirst of all, this is all messed up...smoking weed...illegal... \r\nmake sure you stop NOW. stop drinking and smoking. I knew someone who drank all their pregnancy. and the baby was deformed and they had to fly it to a hospital and it was horrible. the baby lived for a couple months but in pain . it had diseases of all sorts, was blind, and so on. the mom is screwed..i mean shes in major debt from all that and still drinking. but think if the baby had lived...it would have a horrible life all because of it's stupid mom.          \nGirl u be fine I smoke weed until I was 6 months pregnant and my baby is healthy smart and sexy... \r\n \r\nAnd my sister smoke weed that entired 9 months and her baby is smart and healthy \r\n \r\nU be fine don't worry.... \r\n \r\nHave a safe pregnancy          \nTo the girl who insulted VA, where the heck are u from? the Commonwealth is one of the richest, prettiest, and most conservative states out of the 50!!!!!  \r\n \r\n \r\nANYWAY....  smoking BAD! Drinking BAD! Stop now! thats that- \r\n \r\n: ) You mean WEST VA a completely different state - where did u graduate from? eheheh JK i really dont care that much -          \nNow you just stop doing it. Nothing you can do about it.  Alot of women have drank or done some type of drug in the early part of the pregnancy.  Usually there are no problems.           ",

	{'answer': u'\nYea... Thanks a lot for downgrading Jamaica so much. People actually live there, you know. \r\nWell, everyone it\'s not as bad as she\'s making it seem. OK? Jamaica is a GREAT place to spend ur holidyas. No Idea why she is outlining and exaggerating the bad parts of it.          \nHe\'s probably not exaggerating but he just had a bad experience. Yes, ppl are aggressive but i think it\'s because u went on a cruise. So they stay in an area where they know that there will be crowds of tourists. If you just come and spend some time at a hotel in ochi i doubt you would have a bad time. and you won\'t see any \'half decent\' botanical gardens. \r\n \r\nThe statue that the guy was probably talking about was one of a rasta man with giant penis. That the one that people usually pay to take a pic with. \r\n \r\nI am a Jamaican, so mabye either way I would probably have a different experience from you, but I have been to ochi many times and I\'ve never had a bad experience. \r\n \r\nI don\'t recommend cruises for experiencing a country. People make it their job to sit and wait for ships to come in so they can hustle. \r\n \r\nDo not be discouraged, JA is lovely. I\'m very disappointed and slightly embarrassed about your story though. Please come again and maybe go to Negril for another try.          \nto me you sound like a big whiner. 1st of all its a 3rd world country and of course pple are hustling to make money. all you have to do or say is no thank you. it is not that big of a deal that you make it out to be.          \nI know exactly what you\'re talking about and unfortunately getting off a ship in Ocho Rios is not the best first impression of Jamaica.  There are just so many people trying to get enough money to feed their family and the ship is only there for a short time so they have to be aggressive.  Most times fares and prices are negotiated.  I have been on many cab rides in trade for a backpack. Don\'t judge Jamaica but that one limited experience.  It is a beautiful island and the people are warm and friendly. "No charge to look" is a common expression. "Being a guide" sometimes brings a tip.  They have huge competition and are just trying to make a living.  When the ship leaves the money goes with it.  You can\'t appreciate the beauty of Jamaica by getting off a ship for a short time.          \nWell I\'m sorry to hear of your terrible experience in our country.  \r\nBut if you nah like Jamaica don\'t ever come back again!  \r\nYour scaring away the tourists here on yahoo who might want to go.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Hi all \r\n \r\nFirst off, I hope this article doesn't put a dampener on anyone's holiday plans to Jamaica, this is just merely documenting my experience, and I welcome anyone to share their good/bad experience too. \r\n \r\nI was recently on a cruise and we stopped at Ocho Rios. We had been pre-warned that the sales technique in Jamaica was aggressive. As soon as I had got off the ship I was swarmed with cabbies insisting I take their cab to this and that and everywhere for very high rates. I had to battle my way through just to get to the security gate to the street! I thought it was very unfair as there were some people (elderly, disables etc..) who had to take a cab at those extortionate rates. Once I had reached the street, heading toward the downtown area, I was once again confronted by more than a dozen cabbies wanting me to use their cabs. After that I came to an area of people selling things behind a fence with special 'Tourist police' watching them. Later on I spoke to these tourist police and they told me they were there to protect tourists, and that the reason those particular sellers had to sell from behind the fence was because of their previous aggressive selling to tourists. I was offered everything from shells (which I could get from the beach) to quite decent souvenirs.  \r\n \r\nOnce I hit the downtown area I was shocked. Some of the streets looked worse than some slums in India and that unfortunately stereotypical smell of weed dominated the air. \r\n \r\nI quickly figured that the general rule of thumb in Jamaica was that if you touched something you HAD to buy it, so I was cautious to only LOOK at everything. Shop sellers came out and beckoned tourists into their stores shouting 'It's free to browse!' Free to browse? Are you kidding me? Of course it's free to browse! Who in the hell charges someone to LOOK at their shop? \r\n \r\nAfter taking a short walk through a near by botanic garden which lookd half-decent, I was confronted by a boy aged probably 16/17 who told me there was a cool tortoise sculpture I had to get a picture with. I told him thank-you I'll check it out. He insisted I followed him to it. I walked away getting the impression he definitely wanting payment just for showing me a statue. \r\n \r\nThese are just a few of the things which I experienced in Ocho Rios. Please let me know your impressions/experiences as I'd love to hear some positive ones - but if there are negative ones I'd love to hear them too! \r\n \r\nThanks all!  ",

There are certainly people who don\'t like it. However, many do like it. Most of us don\'t care one way or another. \n \nMost of us like Americans. However, if you fake a "British" accent, you will be a figure of fun. You may think it sounds authentic but we will spot it instantly. Even most American professional actors aren\'t all that good at it.  \n \n"British" accent can be English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish. All of them are sub-divided into regional accents. Which one do you think you are doing? \n \nDo youself a favour and speak in your normal accent.          \nDon\'t be ridiculous          \nNo, we don\'t hate it.  We have so many different accents between us that it\'s just another one.  You might think you do a good British accent but we WILL notice because we have so many accents ourselves and our ears are "tuned in" to it.  If anyone spots it, you\'ll look silly.  You\'re better off not trying.          \nUs British Natives always know if your not from around here. Don\'t try it unless you want to get beaten by a bunch of otherwise friendly people.          \nno because there is no such thing as a British accent , you can\'t fake somthing that dosent exist          \nYou\'ll sound like an idiot trying to put on a British accent          \nNEVER..IT goes down like a fart in church.....Plain stupid...That being said, many who do settle here get a bit of an accent......My other half speaks with a bit of  a North Of England accent, uses local phrases and sayings, but is from The Middle East . HOWEVER it sounds natural because gained over time, without being forced......By the way ALL our accents inn THE UK are BRITISH by definition.....          \nVery pretentious and that is how you will be though of.........it may sound OK to you...as for " I hear that they hate the American accent." did you also hear the British are not obsessed with accents like the Americans seem to be!          \nYou\'re acting about 10 years old. British people really dont give americans or their accents a second thought in their day to day lives. Until you said that the inane thought probably hadnt crossed people who have better things to think abouts minds. I will say it sounds fake as any British person would notice it and laugh at you within a second. You\'d be a laughing stock if you started putting on an accent and it would be a million times worse than speaking in your normal voice. What is this mythical accent anyway as there are hundreds upon hundreds of British accents and we have been living amongst them all of our lives so I guarantee you we would notice. Also I suppose you know all of the dialects to associate to this made up accent which if people ask you where it is from as as it would be generic and not distinguishable with any area and clearly put on do you? People always think their attempt at an accent is good but it really isn\'t.          \nWe hate fakers, and we are adept at spotting phony accents. So be yourself or stay away.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nI didn't realize that Air Jamaica was being subsidized by the Jamaican taxpayer.  Being a U.S. citizen I guess that's a subject that I can't comment about. \r\n \r\nWe always used A.J. when we traveled there.  A few years ago they stopped flying from Boston therefore, to avoid changing planes in New York, we've been using U.S. Air.  That was really too bad because we enjoyed the airline so much.  Always on time and very friendly.  We were even upgraded to first class a few times which was very enjoyable.   \r\n \r\nIf their service is still as good as it was then, it certainly would be a great way to show the tourists some of the friendly, capable, fun-loving ways of your beautiful island.          \nI dont think Air Jamaica should be shut down. I would rather Air Jamaica to have its own identity because its the national carrier of Jamaica. If the management of Air Jamaica  have no other choices, I do think they should merge with other airlines in the caribbean such as Caribbean Airlines and Cayman Airways and become one major caribbean airline. \r\n \r\nAnother method is that Air Jamaica can become a low-cost no frills airline. The cheaper the airfare the most likely people would travel. They can cut out  meal services to save money but still give complementary beverages. I travel to Jamaica 3 to 4 times a year from NY because of Spirit Airlines low fares. I bypass Air Jamaica because I simply cannot afford them even though Air Jamaica is still my first choice.          \nI do not think Air Ja shoudl close down because of the simple fact that it is the best airline to the Carribean.It is the best that we have. When I fly Air Jamaica I feel at home and treated good. Taxpayers pay for a lot of bullsh**t so why not air Jamaica. That is the national airline of Jamaica that would not be good for the country.          \nWell if a me a pay fah and from me born me neva go pon plane yet dem fi shut it dung. \r\n \r\nlol \r\n \r\nEconomically I think it is a waste, the only excuse to not shutting it down would be to restructure it's management and operations totally and see whether any good profit may be made.          \nNo, What they should do is try to make the airline better and stop messing up everything.          \nI dont think so but the last time I flew I had to take American Airlines b/c Air Jamaica was charging almost double the fare. They need to find a way to subsidize the fare and also a way to make profit.          \nNo they shouldn't close it down but try and find a rich investor or company willing to buy a very large portion (say 80%) and keep the name and routes.          \ni believe AJ is starting the process of trying to sell the airline to private investors.  the PM was speaking about it during his resent trip to the UK.          \nNOPE, not all atall. \r\nI perfer flying Air Jamaica, and almost only fly AirJ exclusively. I had taken American Airlines to Jamaica and it was the ABSOLUTE WORST plane ride ever. \r\nI would always spend more to travel on them because: \r\n1. its our National carrier \r\n(and WE JAMAICANS FULL OF NATIONAL PRIDE) \r\n2. its only about $20.00-$30.00 mre than Spirit except when they have one of those off the wall fares, i.e. 5 centes fare, $9.00 fare etc...but, kinda works out the same anyway after paying to check on luggage and the taxes \r\n3.you dont pay for LUGGAGE to be chceked on UNLESS its overweight \r\n4.you get champagne and REAL FOOD, not cheese trix and a half can of soda....(depending on what time you fly...outta fll to kin on 7am flight u get full breakfast) \r\n5.shorter flight time, cause they can fly over cuba and not around it \r\n6.they offer SAFE AND SMOOTH LANDINGS>>>besides anything JAMAICAN MI SPONSER          ",

	{'answer': u"\nFirst of all, you have to be the one to make the conversation--if he's got poor communication, he won't start. Then, perhaps you should let him know you're not judging him or being controlling. You just want to talk.          \ni second the not judging or being controlling.  very important point to remember.  but here's what i came to say.  tea time.  yes, i read an article about communication and it said have a set time a day or week or however often you decide.  let it be a relaxed atmosphere that you plan on for just talking.  and during that time you can both talk about your hopes and dreams and feelings and wants.  let it be as positive as possible without blaming or complaining.  just listen to each other without thinking that you have to solve each other's problems.  let the other person finish what they are saying before you answer.  my husband and i call it tea time.  we make tea and sit and talk.  it's great and has helped us a lot.  i hope it helps you too.          \nwhen me and my b/f first got together i had to write in my phone and let him read it, even though he was sitting next to me. maybe you should try and write to each other back and forth. to get it started while watching tv or what ever write down something silly like i know someone that real thinks your sexy or whatever lol and then see if he'll write back. if he doesn't have to speak word, but can write them to you he may open up a lot more. you will be suprised. look at this link it maight help too. good luck!! and remember just give him some  time. look onthe bright side if he's let just say shy around you and your with him, theres a good chance that he's not messing around on you.          \nI think u should get used to this and maby he will improve by time          ",

	{'answer': u'\nWithout a Masters or PhD you won\'t get a job. You need an advanced degree and experience to qualify for a work visa \nWhy not try Canada or Australia which have Work Holiday Visas for UK citizens? The US doesn\'t have a visa like this          \nThe UK is not eligible for the green card lottery and the USA only gives work visas to those with qualifications, experience and a job offer in a S(ceince) T(echnology) E(ngineering) M(aths) fields. Besides that you need big monet to invest or a marriage. It is hard unfortunately but the usa has a major immigration problem so only takes those it needs.          \nNot a possiblity for you....you have the whole of Europe as your playing field without the need for a visa and with all the European countries that there are you can find one which suits you  to make your fresh start...however without education and work skills regardless of where you go nothing will change, so i suggest you get back into education as with no work  then you are wasting your time and yourself as it can be used to improve your abilities and future prospects          \nOur immigration system is based on nepotism and political correctness. If you are related to an American citizen, you&#x27;ll have no problem getting citizenship. If you aren&#x27;t related to an American citizen and don&#x27;t marry an American to get a green card, it&#x27;s going to be difficult.  \n \nOur immigration system prioritizes people who come from 3rd world countries over anyone else.  \n \nMy advice, come to America without a visa, and simply don&#x27;t go back. We have so many illegal immigrants here that can&#x27;t even speak English and our government does absolutely nothing about it.  \n \nIt doesn&#x27;t pay to play by the rules in this reguard.          \nGood luck on getting a 3rd category certification and resultant visa for UNSKILLED workers.

	{'answer': u'\nHe goes into defensive mode instead of resolve mode. I would suggest a mediator like a therapist to learn good communication that works for both of you. This is a totally normal issue for couples and trust me therapy will help in the long run rather than fighting like this for the next 10 years and damaging the relationship.          \nyou are in an abusive marriage. your husband is abusing you. check with a local woman\'s shelter about what to do with domestic violence. domestic violence is not just hitting. it is the other stuff you mentioned. good luck.          \nDoesn\'t sound like communication is the problem.  He communicates.  He\'s telling you that he doesn\'t respect you. \r\n \r\n"he just snaps into this total jerk, that completely loses his temper, he mocks me, he screams and cusses at me, he is very vendictive, and completley unreasonable" \r\n \r\nYou\'re married to a boy -- not a man. \r\n \r\nGo get counseling.  If he won\'t go, then you go by yourself.  This is gross immaturity.  You need to try to bring the level up yourself -- and maybe you can.  If that doesn\'t work then I think you need to set some limits on what you\'re willing to accept.  You don\'t have to accept this kind of behavior. \r\n \r\nYou\'re married to a boy.  Your "man" needs to grow up and maybe you can help make that happen.  Get counseling.  Go by yourself if he won\'t go. \r\n \r\nGood luck.          \nThere is no way you should have allowed this behavior from him.  You need to put your foot down or he\'ll walk all over you.  Men will do anything for a woman, and you hold your rights! \r\nFirst, if this ever happens again, you FIRMLY say,  \r\n"You, listen to me (with a very determined and raised and LOUD voice)..you are either going to listen to me or there will be no more communication from both of us until then.  If he chooses not to, then you DO NOT talk to him until he talks to you to resolve the issue.  If you give in, you\'re an ***.  Then in a a very CALM voice, you let him know what it is you don\'t like. \r\nUnder no circumstances are you to get angry or cry but stay calm and IN CONTROL.          \nwow! has your hubby always been this way...most of the time when a relationship starts you know when you fight that person will always be like that, the way they were the first time...if you are having problems communicating you feelings with him you should let him know.  Have you told him that it is hard for you to talk with hime w/out being scared that he is going to blow up on you?  Men cannot read minds...if you have told him this and he still becomes angry then mabey you should get out a pen and write down all the issues you have so when you confront him, they are infront of you...if that dosent work i would try and seek some counsuling...other people that ca watch your guys\' behavior...can also show you other effective communication tools that you might be able to apply to your marriage..i wouldnt give up....          \nI think you need to explain to him the seriousness of the situation.  You need to let him know you expect him to hear you out, whether he agrees or not with what you are saying, and assure him he will have his chance to speak.  He is denying the fact that there is a problem, instead of accepting and trying to work out the whatever the issues at hand are.  Tell him that if you both don\'t work things out, that soon one of issues are going to be so out of hand that there will be no chance for repair.  He also sounds like he is an abusive partner.  It is not your fault that this happens, it is his. \r\n \r\nIn your situation, I\'m leaning towards you might want to seperate from him for awhile so he understand how serious you are about this.  I went through this for quite a while myself, and I got to the point I no longer cared about the relationship or person.  Sometimes it\'s the only thing you can do to get your point across.          \nTry listening carefully to what he is saying.  More often than not, the things he complains about most are what he sees as his own shortcomings.  And remember, nothing is so sensitive for a man as his ego - his image of himself as a man / lover / husband.  What you offer as a topic for discussion, he may interpret as criticism of him. Try focusing your comments in a way that enables him to respond as comforting, guiding you.          \nwhy stay..look, i know it\'s only been 1 year but why stay...you two should still feel like newly weds...was he like this prior to you two getting married? Tell him what you told us, don\'t make it long, get to the point. Don\'t throw accusations, he\'ll only explode, you want to make him understand and know that the lack of communication is hurting you and the marriage, if he response in a hateful way...tell him that you want separation.          \nThere is never a good reason to stay with someone that treats you badly.  You need to not accept this. \r\n \r\nThis talking stuff does not work for him in even a little bit and in a very big way.  If he has this visceral of a reaction he has serious insecurity issues and your emotional need to have these resolution talks is a very bad match for his issues.  You can try some therapy, but only if you can find a way to stop the abuse. \r\n \r\nGood luck.          \nwow sounds like my bf. I\'m not married but we live together... i feel the issue is important and needs to be discussed and he jumps up and down like a monkey. its like this Hun i say either we work on this as a team or you f.u.c.k. off out my life so i can find a man who will treat me right and who acts like a man and not a cave dwelling ape. you may not realize this but what he does is abuse. he is verbally abusing you and how can you respect him if he degrades you. write down your feeling on paper i mean really dig deep & tell him how you feel what you want and so forth then just leave it where he will find it and read it or even give it to him to read...tell him if he dont read it then   tell him its over. as humans we have to teach others how to treat us... if they are not willing to comply then they dont care about you or respect you. ask him if he want it to work...if he say yes then say "well then we have to work as a team and stop working against each other or we wont last",  because im so sick of being shutdown and not being able to talk to my partner about things that get to me.          \nIn my opinion communication is the hardest thing. There is a book called fighting for your marriage. There is an excellent communication technique illustrated in this book. With most couples there is a with drawer and a pursuer. You sound like the pursuer and he sounds like the with drawer. I used to be one. Like a drunk driver trying to see through 4 cups. People have filters when we try to listen. Sometimes we hear something different then what was said or intended. Try to paraphrase to understand better. Never place blame on one or the other, this causes men to think we have done something wrong. Most men think these old issues were solved already because they went away and everything seemed fine to them. We don\'t understand. Take slow steps using the paraphrase technique and you might understand each other a little better. Good luck.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nYou will be okay and the baby will be okay too.. Just don\'t do it anymore until after the baby is born.          \nHmmm. Yes, it could have hurt your baby. But i think everything will be okay. Try promise yourself you\'ll stop, AND you won\'t do it anymore even if you werent pregnant! Weed can mess up your body. I have a friend who smoked weed during her pregnancy, and when she had the baby...the baby had weed in her system, and they took the baby away from her, and now shes fighting to get her own child back.          \nKeep in mind that when you smoke weed - traces of weed can stay in your system for up to 6 months?! Contact your doctor for an accurate answer since you\'re early in your pregnancy but overall, don\'t use any substance during your pregnancy - 1st trimester or last - makes no sense          \nas wrong as what you did is, i\'m not gonna judge.  i\'m sure you\'re baby will be ok as long as you stop that kind of behavior from here out.  don\'t worry.  and talk to your doctor if you\'re uncomfortable about it.  good luck!          \nSo you justify the fact that you smoked weed during pregnancy because you have anxiety? You were worried your anxiety would harm your baby, but you thought smoking weed would be better for it? If that\'s the case, you\'re really not fit to be a parent. You should be worried, your child may be born with physical or mental birth defects. Pregnancy is a long, tough journey and if your "anxiety" is too bad to deal with that, to the point where you feel you\'ll need weed to deal with it, I would suggest re-examining your choice to be a parent.          \nDon\'t worry so much.  I have a 2 month old and I had no idea I was pregnant until I was 8 weeks.  I got drunk the 2 weekends before I found out, smoked weed everyday, and as much as I hate to admit it, I did ecstacy pills both weekends I drank.  I had no clue I was pregnant, once I found out, I stopped everything and my lil man is just fine.  Matter of fact being that he is 2 months old, he is ahead of most other kids his age.  Don\'t stress so much because added stress can make your pregnancy difficult.  I worried my WHOLE pregnancy about those 2 weekends and everything came out fine.  Just stop what you have been doing.  Good luck!          \n It is possible that any type of drug will harm your baby while pregnant. \r\nAnd did you smoke even though you knew you were pregnant? (When you said you smoked twice in the last 2 weeks)           \nMarijuana is the only drug that has no toxins whatsoever. The only reason why it is illegal is because the government makes too much money busting people.          \nyoure a good mommy? and you smoke weed? that doesnt sound like a good mommy to me! you can get meds for anxiety there is no reason to be smoking weed! people like you make me sick- there are so many people who would make good parents and want to have kids but cant get pregnant- then theres people like you who dont care about the baby\'s health!  \r\nand to the person who said- dont smoke again until after the babys born...she shouldnt smoke weed ever again! theres no reason to start again after the babys born...          \ni don\'t think any studies show that weed hurts your child, you sound like your doing good coming off of it so keep up the good work, your baby is fine          \nHi sweetie! First of all, what\'s done is done and worrying about it could only stress you and have a bad effect on the baby. Most of women drink and make mistakes during the first weeks of pregnancy, not knowing they are pregnant. I remember sitting in the doctor\'s office and going : "I drank a redbull, took my medicine for migraines, drank 2 beers,..." She had to interrupt me and say "Don\'t worry, everything is going to be fine." My baby is now born and she is perrrfect. \r\nAnd believe me, those pills I take for my migraines must be way worst then a little weed. Research Melanie Dreher (google her name) and it may reassure you, as well.  \r\nAs long as you stop from now on, everything should be perfectly fine. Now that you know it don\'t risk it. But don\'t worry about the past. What\'s done is done, as I said. \r\nCongrats :D          \nJust pray and not do it anymore!! not even when your finished having the baby i knwo you might get tempted but just dont do it.........because the baby will still be a second hand smoker if he/she is around you when your smoking cause the baby is gonna smell it!! but just pray and chill out! good luck girl          ',

Maybe if you spent less time getting high, you'd know this.          \nBack in the day,  I guess it was just being lazy & doin nothing.  Sitting & looking at stuff.  Doing nothing & going nowhere.

	{'answer': u"\nno, the terrorists are hiding bomb making materials in ketchup          \nas long as you don't have liquid you're good to go.          \nCall the airline.          \nFood, yes, but no drink. In order to bring food onto a plane, you have to go through security. Security will not let you have any more than 3 ozs. of any liquid.          \nHard to tell because what's allowed as carry-on seems to change a lot & vary by airport.  To be safe, I'd say mp/  Buy something after you get through security..          \nIf the plane is not from the airport, then from where is it?          \nI'm not sure you can get that through Security. I would check with the airport, not the airline. I highly doubt it but I could be wrong.          \nThey actually have Macdonald's at some airports!          \nno,  they will take it away from you unless you get it after passing through security,  also, do not bring any liquids with you in your carry on or on you unless they are in your checked baggage.  if you buy something at an airport on a conection flight, make sure it is not liquid, some foods are ok but other foods they will take away from you, exspecaly peanuts, or probably anything bigger then an m&m.  if you buy food after security, you can eat that on the plane, and they have drinks you can ask for on the flight.  soda, water, juice, and so on.   hope everything goes ok. \r\n \r\nseriously, they will make you eat it right there before you go through or throw it away.  you'll leave hungry.  most places in the airports arent that bad  only about a dollar higher.  a few extra dollars is better then waiting 2extra hours for security to tell you that you food is really a bomb.  hah.  have fun!          \nYou absolutely cannot bring food through the security check point.  That why most airports have food places on the other side of the checkpoint.          ",

	{'answer': u'\ncall travel agents now, they will advise you          \nWhat a dillemma!! I would first find out if your tickets/reservations are refundable.  You also may be able to use your plane tickets for another destination, probably for a small fee.  For example, a lot of airlines will let you exchange your ticket for cheaper flights if it is within a one year time period.          \nunder the circumstances you should get a refund go to your travel agents          \nTake a look at this link..  \r\n \r\nSeems like it passed to me but if you really want to change the trip..contact the people you booked your trip throught ASAP! \r\n \r\nGood luck and Congrats on the wedding :)          \nTake a kite.          \nYou could just hold the wedding of your dreams and let the locals, whose lives will have been shattered by the storm, bare witness to the nice foreign tourist using their land as a party ground for her own pleasures while doing nothing to help improve their grim situation..          \nTake your  mop and bucket with you and help the friendly locals clean up, they will love you.          \nGo and enjoy.... \r\n \r\nThe locals need you to come and they may need a little help. \r\n \r\nOchos was not hit too hard, you might find it has minor damage compared to the south. \r\n \r\nGo and enjoy, bring candles, flashlights, babyfood....bring things to use and leave with those who need them. You have a sobering and fullfilling trip.          \nthings should be fair to fine by wednesday.          \nI say go ahead and go.

	{'answer': u'\nwell take care of your constitutions before you leave. and don\'t down all kinds of water and eat all kinds of food. 6 hours actually isn\'t that long. Try 12 :)          \nbring a good book you\'ll get swept away in the story and won\'t notice the time "fly" by( see what i did there?). its what i always do for long journeys.          \nWhat kind of a cheap *** airplane are you flying? How could anyone possibly expect passengers to wait until their destination to use a toilet? My advice is try hibernating.          \nDraw \r\n \r\nText \r\n \r\nRead \r\n \r\nMagazine \r\n \r\nWord Puzzles \r\n \r\nEat \r\n \r\nSleep \r\n \r\nMake a book \r\n \r\nMake poems \r\n \r\nMake a Necklace \r\n \r\nhope i helped          \nbefore you go on the plane get a novel like vampire diaries \r\nor bring something like ds dsi psp laptop phone  \r\n \r\nor just Zzz 6  hours long :) \r\n \r\nor  bring cards \r\n \r\ndraw and colour \r\n \r\norder food \r\n \r\nbring a ipod or cd player and listen to music          \nSounds like you\'re going to be on a small private aircraft. \r\n \r\nRead \r\nListen to music \r\nSleep \r\nDo a puzzle book \r\n \r\nMake sure the aircraft had a "Port-a-jane" on board.          \nBy facilities, do you mean toilet? If you are flying on an aircraft that will fly you 6 hours, I can guarantee there will be a rest room. Most aircraft have them unless you are flying on a puddle jumper for like 45 minutes. Three things to do: \r\n \r\nRead \r\nListen to music \r\nSleep          \nWhat kind of airplane doesn\'t have a bathroom? \r\n \r\nAnyways, try not to eat or drink a lot or none at all before and during the flight.  Go to the bathroom before you take off for the airplane. \r\n \r\nVIVA LA RAZA!          \n"To sleep, perchance to dream...!"          \nI would recommend bringing a feminine urinary device.  No one will know.          \nif u have an Ipod or mp3 player take it with you ann upload some movies so you can watch while your traveling. you can also fill it up with all kind of music and listen till you get bored. take your favorite book with you.          \nI guess you mean how to keep yourself busy during that 6 hours then take a book or magazine, music player, watch movie, find someone to talk to and try to sleep the rest. \r\nenjoy your trip          \nRead a book! something exciting, so you won\'t notice the passage of six hours... :-))  \r\n \r\nLudlum perhaps?          \nChat to a stranger next to you then chat to the other stranger on your other side..... invite the other strangers from behind your seat.....then invite them all for a game of high stakes poker...u never know, u might be rich by the time the airplane lands!! or u might lose and have nothing to spend on your vacation          \nwell here is some stuff that i would do \r\n \r\nplay pokemon \r\nlisten to your ipod \r\nmake friends with the person sitting next to you \r\nread a book \r\ntake a nap \r\ndraw a picture (not of the plane crashing) \r\nbuy a portable dvd player to watch a movie \r\n \r\nhave a good trip =)          \n1.)

Thats nothing! Try 11 hours or even 18 hours and you\'ll go crazy if you cant fall asleep.  \r\nTake an ipod or another type of mp3 with plus a lot of magazines and books. You can do it! You can survive! I\'ve survived for much longer. \r\n \r\nAs some other users said, don\'t drink or eat a lot of food, so you dont have to ahem ahem..... go to the bathroom.          \n--Put on a diaper.  \r\n--Figure out a new place to live that has airplanes that don\'t force passengers to sit without relieving their bodily functions for six hours. \r\n--Take a few sleeping pills and let the flight attendants clean up your mess.          \nSleep \r\n \r\nIf u have a ipod u can do the following...  \r\nlisten to music \r\n \r\nOn some ipods u can... \r\nwatch movies \r\nwatch music videos \r\nread a magazine  \r\neat \r\neat some more \r\nword puzzles \r\nmore ipod \r\nwatch tv shows \r\nplay games \r\ntake pictures \r\n \r\ndraw \r\nwrite a song/book \r\nread a book \r\nlearn a song \r\nthink of some outfits to wear when you get to your vacation \r\ndesign clothes \r\nthink of baby names \r\ntalk \r\nlook out the window \r\ntext \r\nemail \r\nread a magazine  \r\neat \r\neat some more \r\nword puzzles \r\nmore ipod \r\n \r\nhope this helps, have a great trip! please rate best answer!          \nlisten to your ipod, read "Memoires of A Geisha" (trust me it\'ll keep you occupied) sing aloud. jk. fight dinosaurs (really jk) take pictures. bring a few snacks. annoy people. write draw.

No joke. \r\nI sleep most of it and sit on that little chair and just sleep more.  The plane ride drains a lot of energy, so you won\'t even be bored just waiting.   \r\n \r\nIt\'s not as if a cruise, where people get to do things.

	{'answer': u'\nAugust is the peak of hurricane season in the Caribbean. Yeah, its cheap and that\'s why -weather! You could be lucky and miss a major storm, but you could be caught in something big.  There is no way to predict in advance. \r\n \r\nIts up to you, but I\'d look elsewhere than the Caribbean, if you are open to options, for this time of year.          \nGO TO ANY TRAVEL AGENCY          \nTalk to a travel agent.  You should be able to get some deals in August, as that\'s hurricane season and Jamaica is often right in the path of hurricanes.  If I were you, I\'d purchase trip insurance, just to be safe. \r\n \r\nPersonally, I wouldn\'t GO to Jamaica, but....  Not sure how many family-friendly AI\'s there are in Ocho, but make sure it\'s a good one, as you\'ll want to stay on the resort premises and not be wandering around.  That is, unless perhaps you\'re hardened New Yorkers and used to dealing with aggressive people trying to sell you something [legal and not]. \r\n \r\nYou may want to check out Aruba.  More family resorts and it\'s out of the usual hurricane zone, but August is still "off season" there.  Plus, if you want, you can rent a car and drive around the island - or use the Arubus system [do an Internet search for info].          \nwell how about you go to nay of the caribbean islands          \nOcho Rios, there\'s a great selection of places from which to choose. There are lots of resorts over there. Almost everyone have deals check out that in website and  chose which one is suite with you. \r\nAugust is off-season so I think you will get some discount.          \ncall air Jamaica vacations          \nIf I understand, you want to go in August to Jamaica because it\'s cheaper? \r\n \r\nLike other people alluded to, it\'s a bad time to go down there due to the hurricane season. I suggest you find another area to go to like Aruba, Carriacou, Turks and Caicos, etc..  \r\n \r\nIf money is your main issue and you travel to resorts at least once a year, I suggest you either rent a condo from a private party (not directly from the resort) or invest in a resort membership.

	{'answer': u'\nCheck to see if there\'s a shuttle/charter bus that goes from the airport to the hotel you\'ll be staying in. It\'ll be way cheaper. Most hotels in Jamaica have their own transportation. Don\'t know how much taxi will cost but because they know that you\'re a tourist they are more than likely to charge you more. Have fun, climb Dunn\'s River Falls.          \ni am sure all the hotels in ocho rios has shuttle buses that pick up guests from the airport and also bring them back, atleast most hotels in Jamaica do. its safer and a better choice to travel with the shuttle, because in deed it will be cheaper, locals will definitely over charge u because they think u might not understand our currency and ur tourist, locals even overcharge locals lol, especially if u r not from the area. and besides if there might be an accident/ incident u have better chances getting compensated by the bus company. so gud luk and take care. Enjoy Jamaica, land we love. :)          \nThe hotel should be providing ground transportation from the airport, but if not get a shuttle bus ( Island Tours, TourWise, etc..they are inside the airport ) and the charge is US$30 per person to got to Ocho Rios from Montego Bay. \r\n \r\nDO NOT USE A TAXI ! They want 80-100 or more !          \nIt is good to book and plan before you come down to Jamaica so that your vacation has no hitches.  You can go on the Jamaica Tourist Board website (google it) or search for JUTA.  This is a licensed carrier that takes visitors throughout the length and breadth of Jamaica.  \' \r\n \r\nIt is so beautiful when you things in place at any destination world wide to make your short stay welcoming and fun loving.          \nIt depends on how many persons you\'re traveling with. If it is you alone it would be good to take one of the buses that stops at all the hotels, but if you have company it would be best to get a shuttle transportation. It would end up cheaper this way.  \r\n \r\nYou can contact K.A.G LUXURY CHARTER SERVICES INC at luxuryshuttleservice@gmail.com or 1-876-887-3125 and they could pick you up at the airport and carry you to your hotel and any other destination you wish while in Jamaica          \nIf transfers are included in your package price I would just take the "shared" transportation.  You\'ve already paid for it.  If not you can negotiate with a cabbie.  They are pretty flexible.  I wouldn\'t say no more than $15.00, $20.00 per person.          \nIf you are renting a car while in Ochio Rios, some companies will drive to the airport and pick you up. Just a thought.          ',

I didn\'t think much of it besides "Odd".... Though my 14 year old cousin came out of the bathroom after I straightened my room up, and as he was walking by, I seen he had a pair of my underwear sticking out of his back pocket! I of course didn\'t know what to say since it was awkward and a "WTF" moment. Everyone left though and I did a small check and found that one of my thongs from the hamper was gone (I only have a few pair so easy to tell). And two of my undies from the drawer missing... \n \nI don\'t know what to say to him.. Or if I should, or to anyone... It\'s creepy to think why... I mean maybe he just likes to wear girl stuff? Or... I\'m not sure. Either way it\'s awkward and I don\'t know how to bring it up to anyone really, or if I should. Any suggestion?  ',

And since pets are so expensive and just die on you within 5-10 years, you're throwing money down the toilet that could instead be used for paying off debts and bills and saving up for more education that you'll need if you ever want to get out of your parents' basement and not be a frycook or garbage dump worker or mailroom worker that society laughs and sneers at and calls you a loser or college sucker even though you may have gotten really good grades in college and worked and studied hard. And the economy will only get worse since the government is corrupt and lying to us about the truth of unemployment and jobs and no one will do anything until it's too late and we're going to end up just like Greece and Spain with so much unemployment that we'll end up in shambles forever. Yeah on occasion it might KINDA be cool but then again, in the end, I prefer being single anyways, and that's the way I've been ever since I was a baby, and that's the way I decided to be ever since high school and college, and that's the way I'll always be. and if people don't like that, too bad I guess.

	{'answer': u'\nYour parents are trying to protect you from a pedophile.  If they haven\'t pressed criminal charges already, they will do so as soon as they find out you\'re continuing the affair.  Talk to them and let them know you need professional help to cope with this.  In time you\'ll understand how profoundly twisted this creep is and be able to start recovering and start a new life.  If your parents, for some weird reason, haven\'t pressed charges against him by that time then you should go to the police and do so yourself.  He\'s dangerous and belongs behind bars so that he can\'t hurt anyone else.          \nHow about the fact that what he is doing is considered being a pedophile.... just cause he says those things to you doesnt mean its true. Your a child....          \nYou sound like millions upon millions of young girls. All of you are wrong. Dead wrong. \n \nThis guy is a bad person masquerading as the love of your life. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn\'t exist. \n \nI assure you, while this "man" def has lust for your little 16 year old body.. his interest in you is CONTROL. CONTROL LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE LOVE, BUT IT IS NOT LOVE. \n \nListen to your parents. If you love him, you won\'t want him to get in trouble as a sex offender. If you love your parents, you will allow them the peace of going to sleep at night not in fear for your safety. And, if you guys are meant to be together, you can hook up when you are 20. AND NO ONE, NO ONE, WILL EVER LOVE YOU OR LOOK OUT FOR YOU MORE THAN YOUR PARENTS!!!!! EVER!          ',

	{'answer': u'\nnot sure who will win but one thing is for certain there will be a winner          \nGreat to hear this, it looked as tho the aussies might fold at one time. Good for Johnson and Lee.          \nWest Indies lost a golden opportunity to put Australia under pressure by their inept batting.  Australia were in total mess yesterday when 5 wickets fell in succession.  However Symonds and Haldin saved them from total collapse.  Today when West Indies were in control of the game till time time, Johnson who had an ordinary match till then, came out strongly after tea and gained the lead for Australia.  That is the reason why Australia is a strong team as they have players in their rank who can turn the game any time.          \nIn my views if the West Indians bats to their full potential they can win this one. They have a good team but no consistence. The Australians are a tough team to beat, however they are not playing as well as they did a year ago before they lost their main 3 players. West Indies can win this one but they have to bat with patience instead of too much fire power. Batting like my fellow Guyanese Chanders can obtain them a win. They can do it, they have the potential and all they have to do is use it.          \nAs DJ Lillee said: "once in a lifetime  prospect ...".  In my opinion it was hard to see that he could remain out of form for too much longer. \r\n \r\nOnya Mitch!!          \nI must admit Ange im a tad worried about the game our batting lineup hasnt had a good tour thank christ for our bowlers  \r\nthe fielding is a bit shaky aswell there was a few catches grounded this morning \r\nif we are to win it will be of the bowlers backs  \r\nthe only saving grace is there collapses are worse than ours \r\nso on that evidence we should win JUST          \nI WAS pleased to hear that the Aussies had got the wheels back on. I hope it lasts.          \nwell firstly, congrats to brett for proving again why he is the worlds best quick right now \r\n \r\nsecondly, as some of you would have relised, i been worried about Johnson so far on this tour, as i felt he hadnt yet adjusted and stepped up to perform as a test bowler, i also admit i thought he could be dropped, well, i now sit down for a slice of humble pie, Zoolander, you proved me wrong mate, well done, Ange told me i should have some faith in him, she was right, i should have. \r\n \r\nbut also well done to Chanderpaul, its seems that theres just no way to get him out at the moment, in a side that asnt batted as well as they could have, he has been a shining light, well done Shiv          \nYeah Johnson did well.. \r\nA lot of people do have their doubts about him,but how can you doubt a player who comes out and gets 4/41...Great Bowling young fella... \r\n \r\nYeah i reckon the Aussies have this one...Windies only got 216 in the first innings,they are already a few runs behind and second innings just started... \r\n \r\nI reckon we should just call Lee Mr Consistency,because that\'s what he is,so consistant  with his wickets..Go Aussies...          \nWell Johnson was the surprise package for me he is improving by the day which is good thing for Australia another good thing for Australia is that Michael Clarke is consistently taking wickets in Test Matches he is the best part time bowler in the world and will soon become an all rounder only thing that disappoint me was Casson he is not that good Australia need some genuine spinner          \nyes its wonderful to see how good was Mitchell Johnson last night and he established himself in australian team after Mcgrath~          \nthey cant bat          \nIt was really good to see Johnson back. In the start he gave like 9 or 10 runs per over but the way he came back was superrrrrrrrrrrr  He helped the team when they really needed it. \r\nWest Indies was looking good . But hands off to Johnson.  \r\nTo be honest I had not expected that, he was really struggling but good to see that he didn\'t give up.  \r\nI hope that the Aussies bat well. Bowlers alone can\'t help the team win the match. I hate to see Brett lee scoring runs more than good batsman. I mean c\'mon yaar Batsman should take some resposiblity \r\nNow its the Batsman turn to make the fans Happy          \nThe only thing that can save the windies now is rain          \nMitchell Johnson is a great player he just needs to be accurate but it looks like he\'s aced that, hearing from his performance last night. Well Done to him \r\n \r\nThis looks like a good match. Nicely balanced, though Australia are holding the psychological advantage. .          ',
	 'question': u"\n    How good was Mitchell Johnson last night?.... \r\nMitchell came in and demolised the West Indies late in the day... \r\nHe took a teriffic 4-41.from only 11.5 overs....Whooo!! \r\n \r\nThe West Indies collapsed from a position of power at 4-167 at tea to be all out for 216!!!   'ONLY' 80 minutes later, handing Australia a handy first innings lead of 35 runs. \r\n \r\nJohnson, after a disappointing series so far, was the chief destroyer, taking the key breakthrough of Dwayne Bravo for 29- In his first over after tea before adding the lower order scalps of Denesh Ramdin for 1-, Sulieman Benn for 3- And Fidel Edwards for just 1 also..... \r\n................... \r\nI only said the other day have faith in Johnson-He's got talent,and he showed it when we needed it too.... \r\nBrett Lee also claimed 3-64,he got the openers- \r\nGayle for 14 \r\nChattergoon for 6 And  \r\nPowell for 9.... \r\n \r\nOther wicket takers were-S.Clarke-1,A.Symonds with 1 and M.Clarke with 1 also...

	{'answer': u'\nthe baby should be ok, I would definately stop doing that now, so that you dont harm the baby!!!!          \ni dont have an answer for you but i am in the same boat. i smoked all the way up to the day before i found out. i was 5.5 weeks. and iwas smoking heavily. 2 - 3 times a day. and i dont want anyone to judge me its just something i did after i lost my first pregnancy. i hope you and your baby luck.          \nyou and your baby should be fine my sister smoked weed til she was 4 months when she found out (dont know y she didnt kno sooner) but her baby is a very healthy happy baby boy u should be fine          \nThats OK. As long as you stopped it should be fine. The main parts of the body are starting to form right now so don\'t do it anymore.I had an idea I was prego bc I smoked weed and it just wasn\'t the same. It made me feel different and just didn\'t do anything for me. So I took a test. and now im 9 weeks tomorrow.          \nThere has been nothing found in good studies about smoking marijuana harming the fetus. Drinking will,but you stopped doing it when you found out you were pregnant,as did I,and that won\'t hurt anything, you found out,stopped drinking,and thats the end of that. It should not cause any problems. Smoking marijuana wouldn\'t be prescribed and legal for morning sickness in some states if it harmed the baby now,would it? No,so theres nothing to fear there,I know some women that have found out they\'re pregnant and still smoked,their kids are fine,I don\'t look down upon it,it\'s your choice,and it will not harm the fetus.          \nIsn\'t weed illegal          \nWhile I\'m not supporting her habits - she asked WHAT COULD HAPPEN  to the fetus  because of this; she did NOT ask for your opinion of her mothering skills. She could very well be a good mother and you are not in a position to judge. \r\n \r\nWhile the child is more at risk to be born with a birth defect, I would say that the risk is low to medium. Good thing you stopped when you did, many people would continue doing it. Good luck with your pregnancy. xx          \nLooks like everyone is terrified of answering this one !  Yep  \r\nlucky me the first. \r\n \r\nAll i can say is ,  now you know....you are already reacting like \r\na responsible parent....think the 70\'s we did not treat weed as you \r\ndo now, or have the information as you do now.   So i wonder how \r\nmany children were actually born from parents doing weed ! ! \r\n \r\nNOW  , you do know...so do the right thing.   I\'m sure you have  \r\ncaught it in time to make a difference especially if you stop now \r\ncompletely. \r\nWith best wishes, to you and your unborn bub..... \r\n \r\nWhen i answered this there was no O answers ! \r\nHow the H--L did all these other peoples answeres turn up. \r\nI;m getting fed up, everytime i answer something that sais \r\nO answers.....soon as my answer is finished or submitted( in a few seconds)  all of a sudden there are so many other \r\nanswers and before me too ?   how does that happen ? \r\nSorry, but i am getting fed up with YA and this kind of thing \r\nsorry for sounding of. I might post a question this and see \r\nhow many others are recieving the same treatment.          \nOf course I don\'t want people to think I\'m advocating this, or that I\'m saying go back to smoking because that\'s the last thing I\'d suggest. \r\n \r\nBut I really think things are going to be fine.  It\'s my understanding, after doing a lot of research (I\'m not a scientist, though) that there are fewer things that harm an embryo/fetus than people think.  So instead of beating yourself up about it, just adopt healthy habits now.  I think it\'s very unlikely that anything has gone wrong at this point.  Definitely stop the drinking, too; I think it is the more harmful of the two.  I believe there is no amount considered "OK" so cut all of it out.          \nSmoking cigarettes (or marijuana) while you\'re pregnant can harm your fetus. \r\n \r\nWe have a doctor to explains the risks of smoking while you pregnant in this detailed video: \r\n          ',

	{'answer': u"\nOcho Rios, Jamaica is really great.  If you visit you must climb Dunn's River Falls.  It's an actual waterfall that you can climb, it is an amazing experience that you will never forget.  Around Ocho Rios there are many shops and places to buy souvenirs.  The people are nice (they speak English!) and the area is beautiful (looks like a rainforest).  There are also opportunities for dolphin encounters and such.  It is just as lovely and probably less crowded than Montego Bay.  You will not regret it!          \nThere are at least 3 areas that are often visited by tourists.  Negril, Montego Bay, and Ocho Rios.  There is plenty to do in each area and the locals are good at keeping tourists entertained.  Oh, and yes, you can buy ganja pretty much anywhere.  I would suggest you do some research on where you will stay.  Your choice of resorts is the most important decision you will make regarding your trip so choose carefully.  Check out TripAdvisor.com to look at areas and resorts.          \nEven though ganja is available in Jamaica it is still illegal.  Many times you'll be approached while on the beach to buy the stuff.  Most of the time the authorities will not harass the tourist but they can still place you in jail and a Jamaican jail is not where you want to be! So play it safe and don't buy it.          \nwell i live in Jamaica,and ganja is quite illegal over here.if you get caught,with ganga you'll get locked up.why would you want to come to my country for ganja.mi seh ganja is nuh good.yuh hear wha mi seh.di best ting about jamaica,is to enjoy our beautiful white sandy beaches,and hotels,food,and the wonderful site that we offer.come to negril,ocho rios,montega bay,portland,hanover,and many more.          \nI have been many times and Negril is the answer to all your questions.          \nWell i am a Jamaican, but i have never travel all of Jamaica's parishes. I would say Ocio Rios,Montego Bay, Negril and maybe St. Mary.I don,t know about the picking up part. ( Is that helpful enough)          \nI have visited over 30 times and totally agree with Valerie, Negril is THE place to be. About the ganga....Keep a low profile, don't use it in public and never travel with it in an auto.  If you must, place it in a seperate drawer in your room. Never place it in your geer as it reeks....way strong. \r\n \r\nVERY IMPORTANT: Never travel at night alone, anywhere.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Hello all, i am planning on visiting Jamaica soon, and i was wondering which part of Jamaica is nice and has a lot to do. Might be a little off topic but i also want to go there because of there "ganja"! Dunno whether you can just pick it up from basically anyone or what? Anyone information i can get about Jamaica from you all?  \r\nThanks..  ',

	{'answer': u"\nGo live with your dad or a relative and leave your mother a note explaining why you left.THAT will get the point across.You cannot help if your mom and step dad are dufus heads hon.You sound like a good kid who is intelligent and rational, but hurting and I can understand why.GOD loves you and has a plan for your life and suicide is not in that plan.Get some goals and follow a plan and show them you do not need them and that you ARE somebody!Get in church it will help you.You will make friends who will genuinely care about you and encourage you.The United Pentecostal churches are good.          \nplease dont you have a right to live. you will make it out of this. try talking to them          \nI'm very sorry to hear you're feeling this way.

No matter how bad your situation is, suicide is never ever the answer. Please don't talk that way. If you really want to let her know how you feel, talk to her, go see a counsellor at school, talk to your stepdad. if that doesn't work just ignore her. Be a duck, let it roll off your back.          \nI love you! I don&#x27;t care who you are and what you&#x27;ve done. I LOVE YOU. You are loved. Please don&#x27;t be selfish and end your life, life is hard but it&#x27;s not fair to take the easy way out. I believe in samsara: what this means is if you take your life you will be put in the same situation in your next life. You have to make it through this life, it&#x27;s all a test. Be strong! There are people you can talk to who REALLY CARE and want to help you.

It takes courage to share this information. Suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem.  If you are feeling that way, you want to definitely talk to someone.

	{'answer': u'\nI am guessing SLC is Salt Lake City, but what is LGB? [Logan, Boston??]- Matters, because time and distance influence what you take as carry-on.  The longer the flight, the more stuff.  (food*, self-entertainment,,,, *but drinks cannot be from the "outside" - you must buy after you pass security. \n \ninformation needed: flight #, etc.  {some people print their ticket out at home, others at the airport computer kiosks.}  Personal ID is a drivers license, state ID card (for minors), and /or a birth certificate or passport.  [ Look on line for specifics. ] \n \nYou will get a meal on a long flight, but bringing your own snacks can help relieve the boredom. \n \nArrive a couple hours early; go through security, find your gate, then go in search of restrooms, food, etc. \n \nMy guess is the bag fee is each way.  The website might tell you for sure ( or confuse you - lol. } \n \nMy wife swears by EARPLANES (a specially designed ear plug) for combating take-off and landing air pressure variances.  {They are typically only good for a max of 1 landing, 1 take-off, so you might need 2 or 3 pair.}          \nLGB is Long Beach, California \nYou should arrive at least 90 minutes before departure. \nIf you check a bag, the fee is per person, per bag and each way so if you check one bag for the round trip, it would cost 70.  \nYou will need your driver\'s license or state id and the credit card you used to buy the ticket.  You probably won\'t need to show the credit card but it\'s good to have it.   \nWhen you arrive at the airport, go to the Delta ticket counter and you can check in at the kiosk.  You will then pay for the checked bag fee and drop the bag off with the gate agent.   \nThe main thing with carry on is you can only have 1 bag that goes in the overhead bin and a small bag or purse that must go under the seat in front of you.   \nTake a look at the sites below for details on what you can and can\'t bring.   \nIf you are checking a bag, put all of your liquids and toiletries in the checked bag.  That will save a lot of trouble with your carry on.   \nWhen you get to the security check point, just watch what everyone else is doing.  Take your shoes off and if you have a jacket or sweater, you\'ll have to take that off too.  \nThe air pressure in the plane is regulated pretty well so you should be okay.  You can always get some ear plugs that would help          \nI fly all the time, and Delta Airlines is probably the best domestic airline in my experience.  \n \nNormally, arriving at the airport one hour before your flight is enough time, but if you\'re not used to flying or going through airports, I\'d arrive at the airport at least an hour and a half before your flight leaves. The $35 fee to check your bag is for each bag you check, each way.   So if you check one bag going to California and one bag going home to Salt Lake City, it will cost you $70 total.  You can check your bag when you check in at the airport for your flight, and then you pick it up when you arrive at your destination (just follow the signs that say "baggage claim" when you get off the plane; and they\'ll probably either make an announcement or will have TV monitors telling you exactly where to claim your checked bag).  There will also be Delta employees at the airport who you can ask where to go if you need more information.  \n \nAs far as bringing liquids on the plane:  You can bring as much as you want in your checked bag - just make sure they\'re well packed so the containers don\'t break or leak.  Liquids that you bring in your carry-on bags must be in 100ml (a little over 3 ounce) containers, and must all fit in a one-quart Ziploc bag.  They\'ll have more specific information on exactly what you can bring in your carry-on bags on the Delta Airlines website but basically, no knives/scissors/weapons and no liquids in larger containers.  \n \nAs far as air pressure hurting your ears:  I\'ve never had this problem before, and I fly all the time.  Some people say chewing gum will help.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    As Silly and Naive this may sound, I need help with some information on a Trip that I am taking.  \nI am flying for my first time since I was 8 and I am not sure what to expect, pack, bring what time I should be there Ect. \nSo all those of you who travel help a person out because I always travel by car so this experiece is all new to me. \nI am flying from SLC to LGB for a week Vaca. How early should I be to my Flights? I have been researching Delta flight information but still not understanding it all. With checking baggage is it $35 per person and Per flight, $35 round trip per person? When checking in anywhere what information and documentation do I need out. What do I need to expect after checking my bags? What items are allowed in my Carry on bags. \n \nAnother thing is I have never flown without having tubes in my ears. So this is the first time I would have to equalize the pressure behind my ears. Does it hurt as bad as people say it does? \n \nAny Trip advise will help. Please and thank you =)  ',

	{'answer': u"\nWow what a topic to bring up... \r\n \r\nOkay, mostly its has to do with arrogance and playing the Malay's fear from the politicians. Its supposed to benefit all Malays but so far only for the rich Malays gain somethings which is like 3%. \r\nIf you read your history textbooks, its says this is why Singapore seperate from Malaysia but Discovery Channel says that our dear 1st Prime Minister just kick them out...(haha our textbooks are wrong) \r\n \r\nEven though the Orang Asli are the real natives...(the most abused people in Malaysia in my opinion) even the textbooks won't exactly tell you that the Orang Asli are the 1st people here.          \nin malaysia , we have a special malay right ,nobody can question their right , it is a sensitive issue          \nWhile the Chinese were living in towns and own shoplots, the Malays were still in rural areas without electricity or water. Therefore the Malays were given special rights so that they could catch up with the Chinese and have at least 30% of the economic pie. \r\n \r\nSadly the history textbook omits the percentage of economy in British's hands. \r\n \r\nAdded: \r\nWhile the NEP objectives may have been achieved, its achievements will be kept secret so that 'orang-orang tertentu' can have more. In the meantime, some Malays were kept poor (and stupid, I mean remain 'hulu') so that NEP can be potrayed as still not achieved (while potraying the rich Chinese) thus NEP or whatever policy that favors Bumiputra must continue to stay.          \nBecause the Malays are afraid that the Chinese and Indians may over rule them, take over the country.          \n,,,, you must ask the similar question in yahoo singapore section,,,, \r\n \r\nWhy the Singaporean Malay and Indians don't receive the rights the Chinese receive? \r\n \r\n,,, hehe,,,          \nthe same reason why there 4 juta unregister voters in Malaysia \r\nthat mean if u met a non malay that is more than 40 yrs old , he likely to  \r\ntell u he do not care and never vote once yet.........lol \r\nimagined a state like Johor having less than 1000 non malay civil servant \r\nwt the internet register for voter on , the malay r asking for problem          \nveritas is right .... everyone worked hard for Independence, not only the Malays ... but they are so selfish by turning the tables and calling the non-malays 'pendatang' now ..do u think they could have got their independence alone during British time....they cant even speak proper English now imagine how they spoke then with the British ??? Educated teachers from India and China came to Malaysia where they conversed in english with the British ...  \r\nIf there really is a 1Malaysia concept they would declare Good Friday/Easter/Vasaki/Chap Goh Meh as a Public Holiday.... the true malays here are the orang asli .. the malays you see now are all mixed breed...if you check their history they all come from Indonesia...married chinese and indians in malaysia and that's what you see on the roads now ...  \r\nJust pray for our Country..that's all I can say          \nThis is simply because the Malays are in general not as smart as the Chinese and the Indians. If they were to be on the same footing as these two races, they simply can't survive. That's why the government have been helping them by giving them special rights and privileges all the past decades. It's sad to say they still can't perform despite all the help given. No offense.          \nWith a rational and practical understanding, please read my analogy: \r\n \r\nA civilization 'Z' began in the year 2000BC on a huge and fertile land, with the founding of large cities, organized and centralized governance, and a unifying culture, language, and tradition among its citizens. So advanced was civilization Z during its golden age, that it was common knowledge among its people that they were their empire was the centre of the world, much like america today presumes its sole-superpower status. Assume civilization Z continued its outstanding and persistant administration and knowledge-based civilian heritage for 4000 years, and what sort of society would you get? \r\n \r\nA civilization 'B' started in the year 4000BC on a large tropical continent with great rivers, with the establishment of one of the first well-planned urban communities in the world, and having rulers who give priority to science, technology and education. Civilization B may not be as unified as civilization Z culturally and linguistically or even politically, but it is because of this diversity that every society in that civilization compete with each other through war and trade. Constant contact with the other nations made it the centre of trade, and the sheer wealth of the nation made it attractive to more advanced empires. Furthermore, not only is the civilization entrepreneurial and scientific, it is also spiritual. So much so that a few of the largest religions of the world originated from it. Assume this civilization molds its people in its economic, scientific, and religious nature for 6000 years, and what kind of community would be created in its 6000th year? \r\n \r\nA civilization 'N' began to exist circa 200AD on a divided homeland of islands filled with thick jungles and rocky rivers. Having safety from foreign invasions because of its geographical division, each island (and in fact each valley) matured independently and left to its own devices. Only two ancient native kingdoms managed to unite the peoples of the islands, and they only existed briefly. Without political unity, it would be hard to concentrate effort on anything, namely scientific and common adoption of traditions among the people of N. However, assume one good thing about civilization N is that it is strategic. Anyone in civilization Z who wants to go to civilization B must go through civilization N. Having this position civilization N develops a pretty much tolerant, welcoming, and open-minded view of the peoples of the world. So people of N intermarry with people of the west, east, and among people from the other islands and valleys. After centuries of exposure and tolerance, civilization N welcomes everyone to live in it, creating a vibrant and colourful society. But since people from Z and B are more advanced and have an older (therefore more experienced) tradition than civilization N, people of N are at a disadvantaged when competing with them. \r\n \r\nAssume alotting a perfectly equal reasources to a person of Z, B, and N cultures. Each of them instictively know what to do, but since a person thinks and acts according to his mold, wouldn't the result be at varying degrees of success? Shouldn't the resources then be alotted justly, rather than equally, since Z, B, and N know and understand each others' background and how each of them came to their current predicament?          ",

	{'answer': u'\nDUDE! you\'ve got a really f*cked up life there.... well if it makes you feel better i\'ll tell you mine: \r\nim 15 right now. when when i was 6 my parents beat each other in front of me. im mexican (i had the super good luck to be born Fing mexican). when i was little i was really fat. i went to one of those school were everyone seems to be happy and all of them are a bunch of faGgotts including me. i was truly depressed all the time. i had terrible grades. my father always wanted me to get good grades but i just didn\'t care. my mom never has cared A LITTLE for me, she likes my brother way more than she likes me. then when i was on 7th grade i went to this american school (which is the very best and expensive in the state) and i turned into this badass atheist guy who always smoked and got drunk every weekend. i started being a dick to everyone cause i had the same problem you have (being a nice guy and everyone trying to get advantage over you) like for example one girl felt in love with me and directly told her "go F yourself i don\'t give a F about you" and she cried like for 2 weeks.  the only person i didn\'t treat like **** was this girl, which i\'ve been in love for 3 years and this weakened rejected me. now because i\'m a dick to everyone people started to hate and i started to hate people. i realized i\'ve only have 2 good friends and i\'m getting sick tired of one. this week it has been the most depressing week of my life. i\'m trying to start again but its hard...... \r\nmy adivice to your situation is to fight back those Mother Fkers and control yourself from any "evil impulses you get" \r\n \r\nluck bro          \nI truly hope you do feel better - you are certainly worth it b/c you care that you are this way.  I see alot of potential for you b/c you have alot of interpersonal perspective - you know alot about yourself and your feelings.  Many people do not have that, and some are downright reptilian - no feeling, no emotion.   \r\n   \r\nYou may need to see a doctor.  That is the best way.  I knew and still know people with the same anger issues, and they feel terrible.  Medication helps, but weed does not.  I know the feelings of depression - many people have them.  Many who do not go through this will not understand - you have to be forgiving of that.  But many people know what you are going through.   \r\n \r\nI personally know many bad things happened to me, and I have been considered one of the nicest people anyone knows.  I still feel I get verbally stabbed in the back by people I know b/c they may not be happy with themselves, and for some reason see me as being on the "grass is greener" side - which is not true.   \r\n \r\nMy bad luck cycles for a few years, then is good for a few years.  In one cycle of the "bad luck years" I remember working many jobs at once, family members (gradparent) dying, pets dying, tortourous things in the hospital (made her worse for a period of 2 agonizing years - she smoked all her life - the meds and procedures caused her to erase the last 20 years of my life from her brain) happening to my grandparent before she died, not having money, issues with people in my immediate family and their lifestyle (alcohol, etc), fights, etc.   \r\nDon\'t feel bad if this real story of bad luck makes you feel a little better - it just lets you know that you are not alone - b/c no one wants to feel alone. And that is why I wrote this.   \r\nFind a doctor if you cannot take it.  Believe me, you will realize your potential in life.    Bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people, and vice-versa.  Personally, it gives me more faith in God.  For some people, it does the reverse.          \nI know dude life his hard for everyone. You need to stay positive and focus on college and getting a career and being successful and being happy. I think those girls did something very wrong but at least you didn\'t marry either one then find out they were cheating. I heard from someone a couple of things. 1 God never puts anything on our shoulders we cannot handle and 2 What doesn\'t kill us makes stronger. Thing about those things.          ',

Heres my life...Parents always drunk and fighting when I was a kid before and during school k-12. I was always the one left out and made fun of in school. I was sent to a school in 9th grade for bad behavior cuz i was skipping class and was beat up almost every day by other kids for half a year and i fought back twice but got in trouble and the cops said if i did i fought one more time i would go to juvenile hall so i just took the pain everyday for half a year. I than went back to regular high school and I finally met a girl who made me happy for the first time in my life and was with her for a year....come to find out she had cheated on me almost the hole time and never loved me and than she left me for another guy....i was heart broken...that was when I was 17....4 months later I loose my best friend who I had for 8 years because of a car accident he got hurt in the car accident very bad and i didnt so he never talked to me again even though it was just an accident cuz i fell asleep at the wheel no drugs or alchol involved...a week later my dog died and I held him when he did...I had had him since I was 5 that was hearbreaking. Than I turn 18 in september and in december my mom died of a drug overdose 4 months after my dog died....she had been doing pills for 4 years and was a zombie and alcholic everyday i couldnt even talk to her...my dad didnt do pills but was an alcholic too....it was heartbreaking....than in april of this year I meet a beautiful girl who was the sweetest ever to me and i thought she was perfect and possibly the one....we talked about getting married and she even talked to me about what to name our kids and told me she loved me everyday and wanted to marry me and called me all the time....than I find out 6 months later...today...that she had been ******* another guy...she told me she loved him and that she never loved me and that she might be pregnant with his kid....she didnt even care how hurt i was....this happened TODAY....i was lied to the whole time.....now here i am more depressed than ever and shes ******* another guy happy as ever....this is the secnd time this has happened to me with my second true girlfriend.....this life i cant take anymore, i just give up, and i dont care anymore, from being torn down all my life i just have no emotions left inside of me. I have come so close to death a few times in car accidents and motorcycle accidents and walked away fine but it didnt even phase me i wasnt even scared that i could have been killed because in my mind i didnt care...i had a car come into my lane driving down to the beach and almost hit me and i didnt even blink. I didnt care. I am nice to everyone and truely care so much about people but no one cares about me. ive been told im a good looking guy and gone out with hott girls so i dont think its my looks.....bad things just happen to me...its like everything beautiful in my life dies...i cant take it anymore..i just want to give up and fade away...i have gotten an anger problem in the last 2 years from being beat down all the time which i keep to myself but sometimes i will flip out and beat walls and cry and break down and sometimes i do crazy things like go 170mph on my sportbike and do things normal people wouldnt dare to do and i dont even care if i would die like i have no fear. I smoke cigs about a pack a day and weed but rarely and drink rarely. Im clean besides that. I just have no happieness or hope left in me. when im alone Im dark, cold, and distant. Just a face made of stone. But when im around people i try to act normal and happy but im really not. I feel dead. i dont know what to do. i try and try soo hard and give everything they could ask for as far as kindness and attention and always am left behind....being hurt so much has changed me from being nice to people and makes me want to become an asshole who cares about nothing or no one. I feel this way sometimes and im afraid i may just turn out to be that person. a dark cold mean psychopath. I may end up in jail or dead...the pain has changed me from being a good guy to a bad guy because everyone i mean everyone hurts me or does me wrong. even cops. I feel like i have become a danger to society and hurt someone or myself. I dont want to be this way but the more i try to be good the more i get put down and become badder....i need help.  ',

	{'answer': u"\nYou need help child!! Make him move out of state make him go to drug rehab and make him get his life together. If he want you need to get the hell out before you and your daughter get killed leave while he is sleeping go to the homeless shelter          \nyour a little kid facing adult problems, ugh god take me out of this world from serious ignorant kids, go talk to your parants you stupid child, if your parants dont want to talk to you, than tell them seriously and proudly. ugh u stupid child, i love you but you have to talk to ur parants, now go stupid kid, go to your parants          \nThat's a really tough situation you're in, i'm also afraid for you and for your daughter's safety. Coz you can't tell what he can and might do to you or your daughter if he's not himself. Consider all those possibilities, it seems like you don't know him at all. Moving out is the only solution i know, and try to talk to your mom once again, probably she might be able to understand your situation and maybe after seeing your daughter or her grandchild she might eventually accept your situation, coz of all people she's the only who could understand you. About your child's father, it will be hard for you to change him if you choose to stay with him. I also wouldn't want my child to be around with an unpleasant environment. chances are, your daughter's future will greatly affected, ive seen situations like yours. growing up, they tend to do worst and be rebel. there are jobs out there for you, you're just afraid to move and try coz you think you lack skills. just do trial and error. until you find the right job for you, if you will resort to change him, the only way is to send him to rehabilitation center. it will succeed if he was open-minded, and really willing to undergo for his family, that will tell if he really cares and love his family. But the final decision, is for you to decide, you have to weigh every possibilities of it. Good luck..          \nTell him nicely to go to rehab          \n*facepalm* \r\n \r\nI want to you go back and read everything you just wrote, and pretend it was your daughter that wrote it. What would you tell her to do? Wouldn't you want better for her life? Wouldn't you tell her she was being stupid and naive and that she needs to get some self esteem and quit living in fairy tale land that somehow everything is going to end up ok? Because it's not. You're insane if you think this is what a normal healthy relationship is. You're insane if you think this kind of lifestyle is better for a child than a life with no father in it. You need to grow up, get some self esteem, and focus on your child instead of this immature little boy of a boyfriend. You can't change him! Period. If he wanted to change, he would have done it by now. You aren't going to fix him. Your love for him is NOT enough.  \r\n \r\nYour number one priority should be on how to raise your child with dignity and self respect, and the role modeling you're providing her by staying and putting up with this and exposing her to this kind of lifestyle is far from being a responsible parent. You need a serious reality check little girl.          \nWatch enough staring Jennifer Lopez and take it from there          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I met my boyfriend when I was 15 (he was 18)...he was my pot dealer. at the time he was also dealing worse stuff  \r\nand I knew he was also stealing cars with his homies and other stuff...at the time I didn't mind at all. I mean he was just my pot dealer after all. Then after a while we started dating and I totally fell for him...he was like the best boyfriend a girl could dream. If I wanted anything even very expensive I just had to ask him and after a while he would get it for me. He told me he loved me and that I was special girl everyday. He gave me pot for free but didnt let me touch other drugs. He made sure I stayed out of trouble. The only things that bothered me is that he didn't want to tell me the details of what he was doing and he lied to me a lot. Also when he got mad at me he was really scary It wouldnt have surprised me at all if he had started beating me but he never did he just hit himself or started hitting stuff...but he didnt get mad often like most of the time he was really a cool headed kinda guy and I soon learnt not to piss him of.  \r\nThen when I was 16 I got pregnant and my mother kicked me out of the house. I was scared of his reaction but to my surprise he was really excited to become a father he was really happy. I went to live in his appartment and for a while life was real good. He promised me he would find an honest job and be a good father and I believed him but he didnt. He doesnt seem to care for our daughter at all he says he loves her but barely talks to her.He buys toys for her but thats it he never plays with her and barely show her any affection. He says he love me but expect me to basically do everything in the house for him and doesnt help me at all. He doesnt want me to find a job or have friends. He disappear for days sometimes weeks and when he comes back hes either full of money or wants us to change appartment/city/neighboorod. I think Ive lived in 20 different places so far.  \r\nAnd now I think he mustve pissed of the wrong people or done something really horrible like a murder. He's not himself anymore. We had to change appartment again and he doesnt let me out anymore he says that its too dangerous. He sleeps all day and only go out at night. He has panic attacks despite all the pain killer he take and the weed he smokes and seem really terrified all the time like hes going to get killed soon. \r\nAnd now Im scared really scared. Scared of whats going to happen to him (he doesnt what to tell what he has done) and scared for me&my daughter. I dont want my daughter to grow up living such a life but I dont want to be a single mom I dont want to grow up with no father like I did. And I dont know where I could go what could I do. I cant go back to my mom. I dont have any friends. I havent worked since I was in high school. I have no skills. And I dont want to abandon ''Kyle'' first because I still love him second because Im afraid of what hes going to do to me if I do. And I feel like we are really kindred soul I mean we are really similar at heart. I grew up without a father with my mother abusing me and he grow up with a step father who beat for no reason almost everyday and a mother who was either to stoned or drunk to properly take care of her children. He had to basically raise his brother at age 6 he changed his diaper fed him etc. Then when he was 14 he ended up in juvie for a year and when he was out his parents didnt want him anymore so he was basically kicked out. \r\nI feel that he really is a good person at heart he just never had a chance. \r\nSo what should I do? I know that this horrible situation is my own fault but please for the sake of a child (my little girl) dont just start insulting me be helpful \r\ndo you think theres anyway I could change him? And what do you think he has done? \r\nWhat should I do? I dont wanna leave him but things cant go on like that  ",

	{'answer': u"\ndangereous.... carry a weapon with you....dont trust anyone!! \r\nwell...dats wat i heard          \nit would be safer to hire a local for a guide and not merely venture out on your own.          \ni've not been myself but from what i've heard it's dangerous. Whites and non locals a warned not to venture out from the holiday complexes in jamaica.          \n80% safe          \nTake this answer into consideration from a real Jamaican, who lives in Jamaica...It depends on the area you want to go to , for example the North Coast is safer than in the south coast... Remember though that not every where in the universe is 100% safe. You do not need to carry a weapon, just do not loiter or idle on the streets around that's all unless you are in a large group. \r\nHope this Helps!!!          \nGet a guide, don't go yourself. Driving there is crazy and some of the rural roads are a disaster if you don't know them.  \r\n \r\nPlus a guide is always good if you find someone your cool with and trust. They deal with all the locals for you and get you good prices, make sure your taken care of.          \nnot too safe....          \nOK, the areas you are desirous of visiting are pretty safe. If you plan on exploring the Blue Mountain range I would recommend more than just a regular road map but rather a topographical map. You can get topographical maps at the National Land Agency. You would need a sheet 13 or 18, don't quite remember which. I would further recommend that you not try to explore the Blue Mountains on you own but rather get a tour guide.  Also note that if you want to get to the peak you will have to do some hiking in rough terrain so be prepared for that- good hiking boots, water, snacks etc.  \r\n \r\nDriving in Jamaica is a bit tricky. Road users don't necessary follow all the rules of the road esp. indicating be prepared for that. The roads can also be a bit narrow and winding. There is a Black River safari that you can try. You will go with a tour guide and get a guided tour of quite a bit of the river.

In addition to the Smithsonian museums, there is also the Holocaust Memorial Museum. The Capitol Visitor Center is open.

	{'answer': u"\nI don't think it would cope very well in an apartment, even if you do take it on regular walks / swims. \r\nYour best dog size would be something a bit smaller, maybe the size of a standard poodle? Big dogs need space, and apartments aren't the best for them.          \nMy grandfather had one and it was great. They are in my opinion the best dogs when it comes to children. Now i do not know much about them but i can tell you that they do grow to be quite large. Between 130-150 pounds for a male, a little lighter for the females. So that's something to think about depending on the size of your apt. Also i think that it is great that you have a lake near. My grandfather lives next to an enormous lake, and his newfoundland loved to swim. After all that is what they were born to do. I have looked up some info for you also. The dogs droopy lips and jowls makes the dog drool. The Newfoundland dog is legendarily known for its benevolence and strength. It is known to be one of the kindest and gentlest dogs, if not the very best and gentlest dog of all when it comes to children. They have deep barks, are easy to train, are fine guardians and watchdogs, and are extremely good with children. There are several health problems associated with Newfoundlands. Newfoundlands are prone to hip dyspepsia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint), Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder). Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis, also referred to as subaortic stenosis or SAS. This is a common heart defect in Newfoundlands involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. Other than the size issue believe you have chosen a great dog. i hope this info helps you in your decisions.          \nYes they can live in an apartment if taken out regularly,as they are general quite a laid back dog.Yes they are really good with kids they are one of the best dogs with kids i know.Grooming,is probably their only down side in my opinion they shed a lot and have a very long thick coat.Vet fees will depend on the dog and how it was bred. \r\nThe lake idea is very good,they love the water and are still used in many parts of the world as water rescue dogs and sometimes companions for fishermen. \r\nYes there is something else you should know they may overheat in summer and loose jowls may lead to saliva control problems.          \nnewfs are great dogs... be prepared for hair and drool and expect the dog to lay right in the middle of the hallway or right infront of the sink.  we have two large hairy dogs and they are overwhelmng at times (we have 18 acres).  altho they may say these dogs are suited for apt life, i would doubt it. \r\nand grooming?  with a large hair dog, expect to spend 1/2 hour a day grooming...  be prepared! \r\n:)          \ni can tell you from my experience my opinion, my newfie is 7 months old and 95 lbs.  i think a newfoundland is a special breed (i have owned many breeds over the years) he is very gentle great with my grand children (2 years and younger). if you can brush him every day that will cut down on alot of any shedding and keep the coat beautiful plus it doesn't take long to brush him if u keep up with it.   \r\n a good quality food is best for them because they grow so fast.  my pup is on a grain free food because of allergies.  \r\n i think they can adapt to any size house or apartment as long as they can get a daily walk. \r\n if you get you newfie from a good breeder you vet fees shouldn't be much more than any other dog.  take your time and look for a very good breeder or else it will cost ALOT at the vet.   \r\n my pup was so easy to train !  with treats in hand they give you there full attention and listen very well. eager to please you !  \r\n you will need heavy duty toys (kong) the cheaper toys don't last more than a couple of hrs.  \r\n  as i mentioned this breed is unlike other breeds you will fall in LOVE with a newfie. \r\n i hope this helped and if you decide on getting one i wish you the best of luck.          \nThe Newfoundland is a wonderful addition to a family that can deal with hair, slobber, and hugeness and is willing and able to teach the dog good manners before it weighs 100 or more pounds. \r\n \r\nAfter your dog has less energy and your dog might feel hungry as well. That is the best time to train your dog as he is willing to do anything you ask in order to get the food treat. \r\n \r\nBecause of the size of this animal, I would recommend to get this dog only you have a landed house that has at least a small yard. They are ok with apartment, but without freedom to walk around, they will be bored. \r\n \r\nNewfoundland Dog is sweet and gentle, and good with children. They are also courageous and intelligent which make them the dogs that are eager to save people in the water.  \r\n \r\nWhen rearing puppies give them soft food, such as well-boiled rice and milk, as soon as they will lap, and, shortly afterwards, scraped lean meat. Newfoundland puppies require plenty of meat to induce proper growth. The puppies should increase in weight at the rate of 3 lbs. a week, and this necessitates plenty of flesh, bone and muscle-forming food, plenty of meat, both raw and cooked. \r\n \r\nMilk is also good, but it requires to be strengthened with casein. The secret of growing full-sized dogs with plenty of bone and substance is to get a good start from birth, good feeding, warm, dry quarters, and freedom for the puppies to move about and exercise themselves as they wish. Forced exercise may make them go wrong on their legs. \r\n \r\nMedicine should not be required except for worms, and the puppies should be physicked for these soon after they are weaned, and again when three or four months old, or before that if they are not thriving. If free from worms, Newfoundland puppies will be found quite hardy, and, under proper conditions of food and quarters, they are easy to rear.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I was looking for a good family dog and I came across numerous sites that mentioned the Newfoundland. I read a little more about it and it seems like the perfect dog. We live in an apartment but from what I read it should do okay as long as its taken out regularly, is this true? We also have a lake very nearby where we can take him to swim. I just want to know as much as possible about this dog before I make up my mind. Are they really wonderful with kids? Can they be happy in an apartment with exercise?  What about grooming and vet fees? (just to get an idea) How trainable are they? and anything else I should know!  ',

Jamaica is a wonderful place to travel, but just like any other city in the world, you have to be mindful of your surroundings.   \r\n \r\nAs for a quiet place to reax and write, I would definitely recommend Montego Bay.  I've never been to Negril, so I am not sure what you can expect there.  However, I have been to Montego Bay and found it really relaxing and peaceful at night.   Granted, depending on what day of the week you travel there may be more people out in the street than usual due to parties and stuff, but overall, I found it really relaxing. \r\n \r\nYou may want to check out the Gloucestshire Inn.  It's located directly across the street from Dr. Cove's beach, and the rates are pretty decent.  The rooms are nice and the service is also decent.  The hotel features a really nice outdoor balcony that I enjoyed sitting on and watching the sun rise and set over the ocean. \r\n \r\nJust remember: Make sure you're aware of your surroundings at all times, just like you would be in your hometown, and enjoy yourself! \r\n \r\nSafe travels!          \nI've been to Jamaica 6 times (Ochos Rios, Mobay, Negril and Falmouth) and felt safe each trip. Although I never travelled alone I have left the resorts by myself and no problems.  \r\nAs with anywhere you go be sure to be aware of your surroundings and keep your guard up. You will be asked to purchase things as well as ganja but a simple no thank you will let them know you're not interested.  \r\nI think Jamaica gets a bad rap, it isn't fair. Every state, city, country has a good part and a bad part.           \nI would advise you not to travel outside of the tourist area and only stay in crowded areas like plazas and restaurants. A friend of mine and his brother who visited Jamaica was jumped when he tried to go into town where the locals frequent. A couple I know said they were repeatedly approached and ask if they wanted to buy pot when they got off the cruise ship.   \r\n \r\nNO, do not go on the beach at night. We were advised of this by the Bahamian police when we were on Grand Bahama island and I'm sure Jamaica is no better. It's a great place to be mugged. It's dark and it's hard to yell for help.           \nI have been to JA 4 times this year by myself...  my first time, I got the same reaction from people I told.  My trips have been great!  I do have friends that live down there and spend a lot of time with them but there were times I went to the beach or in town by myself and had no problems.  As in anywhere you are - be aware of your surroundings.  There are plenty of places any where you go that can be dangerous,  I got a JA cell phone number through Digicel and had my cell phone unlocked through TMobile so I could use my phone while I was down there.  Everyone had my number and could call and check on me when ever they wanted and I could do the same.  Enjoy your trip - just keep reassuring everyone and things will be fine.  Good luck.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Ok, so I\'ve asked a similar question, but mostly on what to do there near Negril.   \r\nSince I\'ve announced my plans to friends and family, I\'v heard nothing but negativity about it.  One friend of my mother\'s, who travels frequently, went so far as to say "you couldn\'t PAY me to go back to that country", saying they were assaulted when they refused to buy drugs.  She practically begged me not to go by myself, saying she\'d worry for my life.  I mean, geez, I know there\'s crime in the world, and I know it\'s in Jamaica.  ...But, is it really THAT bad?  I just want a quiet, relaxing, beach getaway, to think, write, and enjoy the beauty that is there. \r\nI was told not to go out after dark as well.  Is that good advice?  I mean, not go out at all after dark?  Even to sit on the beach?   \r\nIt\'s disheartening to think that one of the most beautiful places in the world could be thought of so poorly. \r\nSo...is it safe?  Should I do it alone, or wait til someone can join me?  What about walking around the country roads..can I do it?  Can I walk to a restaurant or something 5 or so miles away alone and not have a problem? \r\nI\'m not completely naive, but I do like to find the best in people.  My mother worries I will befriend just about anyone, which is mostly true, but she says I shouldn\'t trust anyone if I even go at all.  How paranoid is that, or is there some truth to it?  ',

	{'answer': u"\nYou will get a better idea of the expenses after you get to the US. Then you can decide whether you need to take up a job or not. Travel and room-rent is a major expense abroad, so if that is taken care, I think you are well off. \nA lot depends on your lifestyle also. If you shop / party / gift a lot, or eat at expensive restaurants, obviously you need the money to pay for those. \nI would say that one dollar is roughly equal to ten rupees. I know that the exchange rate is closer to 1:60, but that is only when you convert the currencies. If you are going to spend there it is closer to 1:10. So your $125 translates to roughly Rs. 1250. If you can manage with that, you don't need a job.          \nI think,the amount of weekly pocket money parents are giving to children has increased by 8.7pc.          \nWhether that's enough money or not, I doubt you will be able to find part time work as a non-citizen and teenager.          \nAs an exchange student you cannot legally work in the USA. \n \nAt that age my daughter was given an allowance of $20 a week and she managed on that.          \nyou need to be careful on what type of visa you are granted to be able to work in the US  \nit all depends on which state you are going to live in, some states are cheaper or expensive than others. I would personally say that this amount of money is risky, you need more than that in cases of emergencies of if that money is not enough for you  \ntransportations are not that cheap at least in where I live in the DC area          ",

	{'answer': u'\nwho knows but santos and atlante suk          \nATLANTE - Maldonado still hasn\'t got its definition sharpened, we hate playing "canchero", impossible for any team to win all 6 games straight....ahhhh what else.......luck wasn\'t on our side.....giving the young players a chance to show what they got and develop, who knows maybe someday we will create our own andres guardado or carlos vela          \nCruz Azul couldnt beat DC by goleada is embarrasing \r\nDC United is doing horibble in the MLS \r\n \r\nPumas tying was kind of good since it was against Dynamo \r\n \r\nSantos losing to Puerto Rico, well the game should have been suspended, everything was in favor of PR, and losing to an unknown team from Panama is just wrong \r\n \r\nAtlante is doing bad also          \nit\'s mostly the mexican teams not giving a rats ***(which i hate). the players are still collecting their pay checks either way and the players know they aren\'t going to be judged on their performances in the concacaf champs but in the league vs teams that are playing their hearts out just to get some attention \r\nusually the teams that want to win the most will win.          \nthey just think because they play in a better league there going to win. I know understand why the fmf only lets the big teams like chivas and america play in the conmebol tournaments because if they put these teams it would just embarrass us          \nAll I noe rite now is that Santos is doing horrible in Concacaf and CRUZ AZUL is like the only team thats really representing Mexico...yea i noe the goal was kinda wack but at least we\'re still in the competition, also we didnt use titulares on that game casi puro sub...          \nPumas have been pretty solid, pumas had some subs and missing a couple couple of starters, the subs aren\'t rally all that bad. Pumas started with a good line up at first. we were scoring, by the second half tuca put all subs in, and had a hard time scoring,we had possesion the hole second half but just couldn\'t get the finish. I\'m not going to lie houston is a good team, they started the game by scoring on us 2-0 in 12 min. I though we were done for somehow we cought up and tied, better then a loss to JOE PUBLIC! (No offense) \r\n \r\nI don\'t know if is just me but why isn\'t the fmf taking this serious! First santos lose 3-1 to the islandes or whatever then atlantes loses to joe public yesterday. COME ON! WHERE THE FMF! MAN! How could we be losing! Something needs to happen!           \ni agree that atlante, santos, and pumas are doing horrible in the tournament \r\ncruz azul isn\'t playing that great either but we are at least winning the games \r\nI think Cruz Azul is taking it more seriously because we are using a team with titulares and a few subs. i hope cruz azul wins it all          ',

Are the mexican teams really not caring of this tournament? \r\n \r\nCruz Azul, now they been doing ok i guess, wins here and there. But yesterdays game vs. DC united was a 1-0 game and the goal was a fluke, bounced of someone else and went in. and DC in the MLS is doing baad... \r\n \r\nPumas, a lil bit more understandable, probably the strongest team from the MLS, Dynamo, a 4-4 tie...pero at home, they gotta get those wins. \r\n \r\nAtlante, how can you loose to Joe Public? is there an excuse? and they lost at home...give me a legitimate excuse, not "they needed a wake up call" \r\n \r\nand finally Santos, if there is any fans on here...but whats up? 3-1 last week against the PUERTO RICO Islanders an USL team, and today they loose 2-0 against uuhhmm who Tauro right? or that team from Panama.... \r\n \r\nI aint clowning on any team, if my team aint playing in a international tournament, ill root for any mexican team...i just want to know from those that have followed the games whats up? or is it just plain and simple, the Mexican teams dont care about this tournament?

	{'answer': u'\nCab albeit it is the most expensive way.  CHeaper and safe is take a cab to Caribbe Tours or Metro in Santo Domingo and a bus from their.  It is a LONG trip so you may want to rethink flying into Punta Cana or La Romana instead.          \ntake a cab to caribe tours which will probably be around $1000 pesos, and if you dont speak the language they will try and get more from you.... \r\nyour gonna go 15 miles west of the airport to then drive by it again on the bus, to get to punta cana... which i think is 80 - 100 miles... puerto plata is alot better... in punta cana you will be limited to activities in the resort because thats all there is in punta cana, and maybe 1 or 2 little clubs here and there... but puerto plata you have a nice town you can visit, some of the best clubs in the whole country, lots of different tours, dunebuggies, 4 wheelers, country adventures, dirtbike rentals, parasailing, swin with dolphins, scuba, the 27 waterfalls, i dont know what else but it will all be advertized in your hotel lobby.... i suggest you take a cab to caribe tours and then a ticket to puerto plata... look up hacienda resort and the playa dorada complex which has more than 15 or so resorts to pick from... and thats where the awesome clubs are... full of tourists and locals till 6am! here are the clubs you have to go to while here, spice, coco bongo, hemingways, roadway and the others surrounding those...  \r\nyour gonna meet lots of girls too dominican women are very friendly... :)          \na cab but it wont be cheap....but boca chice brings back memories...boca chica is popular with the tourist but it isnt very relaxing.

	{'answer': u"\nNot too sure,  but I am from the carribbean,  dont go anywhere you don't know without a native of the country.  You can hang out at the resort and stuff,  I heard jamaica is nice,  but i personally wont go there...... Nevertheless Have fun          \nI would think that 2 single women could get into alot of danger and/or problems with drunken guys partying....like that one girl who was on CNN for vacationing in Aruba, she had just graduated high school, and was with 15 close friends, and look what happened to her.  Bring some guy friends or a brother or someone with you guys...          \nAs in any foreign country, should any emergency situation arise, especially at the domestic level, it is advised to immediately contact your government's embassy or consulate. Governments usually advise travellers staying in the country for an extended period of time to notify their embassy or consulate so they can be contacted in the case of emergency. \r\n \r\nNote that homosexuality is not generally considered acceptable in Jamaica, and can lead to violence. Do not display affection to people of the same sex in public - Jamaica is not a country renowned for its tolerance for homosexuality. \r\n \r\nMarijuana, although cheap, plentiful and powerful, is illegal on the island. \r\n \r\nIf in need of police, dial 119. \r\n \r\nAlso, it is best to avoid certain parts of the island at night. Rural areas of the island are generally safe, but inner-city parts of the island such as some neighborhoods in Kingston (Trench Town etc.) should be avoided even during the day.          \nHow are two of you traveling alone?          \nStay on the resort or take only organized tours with a group.  Jamaica is traditionally known as having an extremely high crime rate.  When I was there last, a knifing took place a hundred yards in front of us - and that was in the tourist part of town.          \nJamaica is a nice and beautiful place to go but you should always be careful everywhere you go, especially when two females are by themselves and when you are not familiar with your surroundings.

	{'answer': u'\nYou\'re absolutely right.. and most teachers will agree with everything you say.  NCLB is an example of government interferance that - like almost always - turns out to be a very BAD thing. \r\n \r\nTo change it, they have to change the current law.   Parents (and teachers) need to be much more vocal about how this is damaging their kids.          \nAgreed.  There is too much political correctness and not enough Reading writing Arithmetic and Geography. \r\nThis is the problem. \r\nTeachers hands are tied from the mandates from the government requirements.  Government has decided that the  slow and the talented students will be taught together and this only slows all of them.  The program is over the heads of the slow children and the program is too boring for the talented student.   \r\n \r\nThis is an example of socialized education.  Shadows of Nationalized Healthcare.          \nExcellent statement.  I happen to be in college, with the goal of obtaining a degree in secondary education (to teach science).  I want to teach, but I have already steeled myself for the reality of our education system.  I hope changes can be made to improve it, but like any large bureaucracy, it will be slow in coming.  Considering the starting salary in public education in our state is $30,000, most people think I\'m crazy for wanting to do it, but it is my dream to teach and I plan to do it.          \nWe have the same problem in the UK: endless ridiculous testing.  I think its the Government wanting to control everything by measuring it.  Measuring something does not mean that you have it under control, it just means that you\'ve measured it!  We don\'t need to endlessly test (measure) everything in school.  We have teachers who are professionals and can make their own, more accurate, assessment of a pupil\'s progress. \r\n \r\nThe Government here also wants to set a "national curriculum" which sounds a bit like social engineering sometimes. \r\n \r\nOf course Government statements always like to push the idea that its the delivery or the implementation that is the problem.  Always someone else\'s fault!  Its never their own dogma that\'s at fault is it???          ',
	 'question': u'\n    And not the product itself? \r\n \r\nLet\'s examine education from a scientific and economic point of view. \r\n \r\nWhy do all of the plans focus on product delivery?  "It\'s the teachers.  They\'re not committed like in the old days."  Or "It\'s the local school officials.  They don\'t know how to manage."  Or "Parents don\'t take responsibility."  Much of that is true, but is it the cause of current problems? \r\n \r\nPeople end up attacking the labor unions of people who do the equivalent of board-of-directors-level corporate work but in a public system, for salaries comparable to the employees at Home Depo. \r\n \r\nWhy the focus on product delivery and NEVER the product? \r\n \r\nThe current testing mania has gotten to the point where in some places legally-required tests and courses take the majority of local school budgets.  Every dime of that goes to big companies like McGraw and Kaplan, not for teachers and supplies.  And the tests don\'t serve as a sample to measure what and how well kids have learned if the system has teachers "teaching to the test." \r\n \r\nThe tests don\'t actually measure the kids\' education.  They measure how far schools have changed things to match our system of measure. \r\n \r\nAnd for every low grade, a megacorp gets another multi-billion$ contract to snatch more school money, money that won\'t go to the schools that got the low grades. \r\n \r\nMeanwhile, curriculum has deteriorated.  School security is either treated like riot police duty, or police states in miniature.  And sometimes (at the same time!) important security threats are ignored entirely. \r\n \r\nI personally know a public school teacher who has gotten to the point where he picks students he think can make it and meets with them privately.  "The stuff I have to put in my courses may help them pass tests, but it\'s useless in learning how to write college papers, or read anything more complicated than a gossip website.  If I don\'t help them, they won\'t make it."  He buys supplies to use for these private tutoring sessions out of his own pocket.  He has been teaching for twenty-one years.  He makes approximately $33,000 a year.  In some places a first-year prison guard makes more than that. \r\n \r\nIn my job, I am involved in education in a non-school bureaucratic setting.  I know my boss would crumple up the average American high school curriculum into a ball and throw it in his little basketball wastebasket.  Then he\'d drop the idea of contractors and go talk to our in-house staff and see what they could come up with. \r\n \r\nOur kids don\'t know math.  Our kids not only don\'t speak French or Spanish - they usually (native-born too!) don\'t really speak English either.  They think an engineer has something to do with driving a car and that Franz Josef is the name of that German kid being scouted by the NBA. \r\n \r\nSo my question is, with all the suggestions on how to address the crisis in American education, why the focus on the delivery of the product and not the quality of the product? \r\n \r\nThe product stinks.  Why are we ignoring that? \r\n.  ',

Also,  she needs to start taking a multi-vitamin daily until she has her appointment. \r\n \r\nIf she\'s not pregnant, her period being late could be due to stress or worrying that she is pregnant.  If she goes longer than 4 weeks without a period and a negative pregnancy test, then she needs to see a gynecologist to rule out any other problems.          \nShe might be but it won\'t be to you. You can\'t fall pregnant while you have your period.          \nShe could be. You may use a pregnancy kit to check or better yet, bring her to a gynecologist to be sure.          \nprobs \r\n \r\new u did it while she had blood pouring out of where u stuck your **** in          \nThe only way to know is to test. No one knows for sure hon. Sorry :-(  Thats my final answer!!! TEST!!!          \nShe can be and don\'t listen to the people who say its not yours because you CAN get pregnant when your on your period and thats how there\'s so many kids running around with no father\'s and end up on talk shows like "I\'m 110% sure I\'m not that kid\'s father because....." and it comes back to be theirs.  So take a test and if she is you need to be supportive of her and if you have any doubts wait until after the baby\'s born and take a test.  Also if she is DO NOT have her take any vitamins until she gets into the doctor.  They have found in a recent FDA study that multi-vitamins have higher levels of the different vitamins in them then prenatal vitamins and can cause birth defects.  Wait until she gets into the doctor and they give her something.  You NEVER start taking anything without dr\'s permission, especially when pregnant.  I didn\'t find out I was pregnant until I was 3 months and never took vitamins, didn\'t exactly have the best habits and my son was born perfectly healthy.          \nListen dude, i had a same questions 2 week ago and i was completely out of my senses just like you are because it was really shocking for both us us... My girl was behind on her periods for like 1 week and we went for urine and blood test... That report cleared us that she is not pregnant and now after 2 weeks her periods also started so just go for a test and it will be much better \r\n \r\nRemember, "Tests are much cheaper than worries"          ',

I think you should invite a male friend and go out with him in the evening. I don\'t think its safe to go alone          \ni dont think its safe u should go wit an adult \r\n \r\nsee the movie taken its based on a true story          \nI second considering bringing a male friend with you just to be safe. I do think it will be OK, though, as long as you don\'t go out at nigh in secluded areas. People may take advantage of your being a tourist as well, and not knowing the area. Be aware of that and just be careful. :) \r\n \r\nHave fun on your trip! Lucky.          \nIt is pefectly OK, as long as you make sure not to go to secluded places, or to "strange" neighbourhoods. Also, don\'t be trustworthy with people you don\'t know (e.g. don\'t get in cars of strangers, etc.). I would have no problem going to Paris all alone, European capitals are safe crime-wise, but of course you can never guarantee where a criminal will show up!          \nMy best friend and I take long weekends in Paris whenever we can, we\'re in our mid 20s. We\'ve never had a problem with safety. I think if you use common sense, you\'ll be fine. We walked around the Eiffel Tower and back to our hotel about half an hour east of the city centre in the late evening, and saw no evidence of danger. \r\n \r\nMen can be very flirtacious there and some will approach and try to speak with you. Don\'t give them too much information, and if you feel uncomfortable just leave. Eye contact and smiling is permission to make an advance, so if you don\'t want them to, don\'t look at them. \r\n \r\nI recommend avoiding the red light district after dark (in the north, around Pigalle and Montmartre), and parks/cemeteries. They\'re lovely during the day, but a bit dodgy in the evening. \r\n \r\n \r\nDress like a local, and don\'t take large backpacks and other items that will make you stand out as a tourist. Be wary of pickpockets in crowded touristy areas, and never leave items unattended. Ask your hostel/hotel for safety information, and if there are any nearby areas to avoid. And don\'t wander around late very intoxicated, even though Paris is normally safe you do need to be aware of your surroundings. Enjoy your holiday :)          ',

	 'question': u"\n    I met my boyfriend when I was 15 (he was 18)...he was my pot dealer. at the time he was also dealing worse stuff  \r\nand I knew he was also stealing cars with his homies and other stuff...at the time I didn't mind at all. I mean he was just my pot dealer after all. Then after a while we started dating and I totally fell for him...he was like the best boyfriend a girl could dream. If I wanted anything even very expensive I just had to ask him and after a while he would get it for me. He told me he loved me and that I was special girl everyday. He gave me pot for free but didnt let me touch other drugs. He made sure I stayed out of trouble. The only things that bothered me is that he didn't want to tell me the details of what he was doing and he lied to me a lot. Also when he got mad at me he was really scary It wouldnt have surprised me at all if he had started beating me but he never did he just hit himself or started hitting stuff...but he didnt get mad often like most of the time he was really a cool headed kinda guy and I soon learnt not to piss him of.  \r\nThen when I was 16 I got pregnant and my mother kicked me out of the house. I was scared of his reaction but to my surprise he was really excited to become a father he was really happy. I went to live in his appartment and for a while life was real good. He promised me he would find an honest job and be a good father and I believed him but he didnt. He doesnt seem to care for our daughter at all he says he loves her but barely talks to her.He buys toys for her but thats it he never plays with her and barely show her any affection. He says he love me but expect me to basically do everything in the house for him and doesnt help me at all. He doesnt want me to find a job or have friends. He disappear for days sometimes weeks and when he comes back hes either full of money or wants us to change appartment/city/neighboorod. I think Ive lived in 20 different places so far.  \r\nAnd now I think he mustve pissed of the wrong people or done something really horrible like a murder. He's not himself anymore. We had to change appartment again and he doesnt let me out anymore he says that its too dangerous. He sleeps all day and only go out at night. He has panic attacks despite all the pain killer he take and the weed he smokes and seem really terrified all the time like hes going to get killed soon. \r\nAnd now Im scared really scared. Scared of whats going to happen to him (he doesnt what to tell what he has done) and scared for me&my daughter. I dont want my daughter to grow up living such a life but I dont want to be a single mom I dont want to grow up with no father like I did. And I dont know where I could go what could I do. I cant go back to my mom. I dont have any friends. I havent worked since I was in high school. I have no skills. And I dont want to abandon ''Kyle'' first because I still love him second because Im afraid of what hes going to do to me if I do. And I feel like we are really kindred soul I mean we are really similar at heart. I grew up without a father with my mother abusing me and he grow up with a step father who beat for no reason almost everyday and a mother who was either to stoned or drunk to properly take care of her children. He had to basically raise his brother at age 6 he changed his diaper fed him etc. Then when he was 14 he ended up in juvie for a year and when he was out his parents didnt want him anymore so he was basically kicked out. \r\nI feel that he really is a good person at heart he just never had a chance. \r\nSo what should I do? I know that this horrible situation is my own fault but please for the sake of a child (my little girl) dont just start insulting me be helpful \r\ndo you think theres anyway I could change him? And what do you think he has done? \r\nWhat should I do? I dont wanna leave him but things cant go on like that \r\ni already posted this inother places but didnt get answers PLEASE SOMEONE ANSWER  ",

You must be very wise &amp; independent if you&#x27;re capable of saying you don&#x27;t want a boyfriend at this age, considering it&#x27;s so mainstream!          \nI think it&#x27;s really smart what you&#x27;re doing. Boyfriends can be time consuming. They can also make you really stressed haha. It&#x27;s more important to worry about your education right now.          \ntrust me...the best feeling is not wanting to have a boyfriend ! because, once you have this feeling...life just gets worse everytime you see couples, romantic movies,,,songs Aaaaaaaand ! \nThat feeling is gonna take away all your seriousness on work..career and etc..! \nIts not bad, love happens,..not with your permission...it just happens ! \nand...no telling your age doesn't help...I'd say the same even if a 30yr old would ask me.          \nIf you are happy single stay single. You will have desire to date being in love and hurt later. Until then dont buy others bullshit. \n \nFlirt and joke it will make you feel more alive. Lead just a bit others it will give you power and inspiration.          \nNo, it is not weird. You have plenty of time for boyfriends later.  Sixteen year old girls that have self confidence, friends and a direction don't need to be distracted by boys. You are busy developing your interests and hobbies. Boyfriends bring drama, distraction, rejection - they can bring plenty of good stuff too, but at 16 - 18 they are not the most mature members of humanity.

	{'answer': u'\nIt was wonderful and very relaxing! Pack lots of sunscreen; the sun is very strong. Pack a good book too, and when you get there, just let your cares and stress go away.          \nI didn\'t stay at the Sandals resort, but we visited this paricular town on a cruise last May. \r\nIt was a lovely place, but when you go into the town to do any kind of shopping, be aware that the street vendors are very aggressive!! \r\nHaggle with them as best you can, there is always a better deal around the corner and you should say so, whether you know it is true or not.  \r\nThe people there pay a ridiculous tax rate on everything (even 17% on groceries!), so those tourist $$ are very important for them. \r\nTake the time to talk to the locals, that will make it a memorable trip. \r\n"No Problem" and "mon" are their favorite terms!! \r\nHave a great trip.          \nI\'ve visited the Sandals Ocho Rios and it is beautiful.  Basically, any Sandals is equivalent to a Marriott or Hyatt with the added benefits of being all-inclusive.  The pool area is gorgeous and the  beach is nice.  I also highly recommend that you take the tour of Dunn\'s River Falls.  It is touristy but well worth the visit to climb the falls.  Also, take advantage of the opportunity to "Stay at one, play at all" of the resorts.  You have the opportunity to try out the facilities of all other Sandals properties without any extra charge.  There is the Dunns River property nearby and if you\'re game for some island exploration..... head over to Montego Bay or Negril for some great touring and eating opportunities.          \nCheck out TripAdvisor.com and type in your resort name in the search area.  Lots of reviews of previous visitors will be available to you.  I was near Ocho Rios in July and you will have to visit Dunns River Falls.  We also did the Canopy Jungle Tour which was COOL!  You go up to the top of a mountain and attach onto a zip line and ride the trees down.  It is thrilling.  We both hated the shopping and found it very annoying.  Jamaica we loved, though.  You will have a wonderful time.          \n          \nI haven\'t been to this Sandals, but I also recommend that you visit Dunns River Falls. \r\n \r\nI have stayed at the Sandals Montego Bay.  While there, we met a couple who had vacationed at the Sandals in Ochos Rios.  They were spending their last night at the Montego Bay property because it is so close to the airport and they wanted to have as much time to "play" as possible.  You can check out of your room but still have full use of the facilities for most of the day.

	{'answer': u'\nThey think they are better than everyone else. Just give a mean growl and they will run away crying.          \nprobly because fance is the rich place. \nwith some rude people most people from france are nice. \nlike my bff  \n \ni hope this helps!!!          \nParis is NOT France. \r\nIt is the \'New York\' of France with an "OD\'ed on tourists", attitude to boot.          \nthey were nice and very welcoming towards me.          \nYou should take this question with the proverbial grain of salt  The person who placed this question has asked five questions in the last day.  One is exactly the same as this one in languages - Also answered four questions about shopping in Glasgow, differences between the USA and Britain, wearing thongs etc etc.  Very interesting answers on the languages site \r\nBTW  I have asked a number of female colleagues if they have found the French to be rude. \r\nAnswers have been (with one exception) unanimous.  The French - men and women are not rude and it all depends on your behaviour. with them,.  If you are snobby, overbearing or terribly pushy they will certainly appear rude.          \nTROLL!!  Read her other questions.          \nTroll. \nThe French do not care about the British and I have never seen a French being rude with a tourist. Also, when you say "I was sitting minding my own business and some guy sat next to me and touched my leg" That has never happened to any of my friends in 20 years living in Paris          \nWomen look at each other in France, it is not rude, it is sizing up and appreciating her clothes, make up etc. I do it, it is done to me, nothing to be bother about. Pretty women and show off can expect to be sized up even more. You\'re not saying what clothes you were wearing. Short stuff? Bared midriff? You can expect to be looked at, as you might have noticed among the millions of tourists in shorts and sneakers Parisians do not dress that casual.  \r\nYou can also expect to have the sleazy ones coming out of the wood as the way you dress shows that you are not local, young and helpless is even better for them. You will meet the same kind of guys everywhere in the world by the way.  \r\nAs for the photos stuff, these are not Parisians, and probably not even French. They are part of the crowd of thieves and scam men who come every summer in Paris to graze on the tourist crowd. Learn to look for a cop in that case, at least in countries where the police is not part of the problem or if you can\'t see one raise your voice.  \r\nI\'m just a bit dubious about the claim that anytime you tried to speak you got an eyeroll, I\'ve never ever seen that reaction in 28 years in Paris. French don\'t roll our eyes, and as you will notice if you read about us we don\'t chuckle, laugh or smile either unless among friends.  \r\n \r\nAnd as a Parisian I can tell you that in summer we hide in the back streets. You won\'t meet us unless you travel in non touristy areas because we avoid these places like plague.          \nthe \'french\' are not rude. you can\'t blame an entire city (if you mean paris) of people on just a few. yes, paris is confusing. you\'re going to get lost. when people see a girl crying in the middle of a big city, you have to understand that they have to be somewhere and although some may or may not have wanted to help you, they have lives too.  \nalso, french boys are extremely straight forward. before you went to paris you should\'ve done some research on it. that\'s just their culture, they\'re not trying to offend you. \nand the people in paris don\'t like to see legs. so if you were wearing shorts that\'s probably why they were staring at you. in addition, in paris you may have noticed that most cafes are either completely open or have a large window on the side- with many people dining outside. the french love to people-watch (who doesn\'t?), and it\'s widely-accepted to do there. they don\'t mean any offense by "staring" at you.  \nand lastly, i have a feeling you might\'ve been pronouncing something wrong or maybe not trying to speak the language correctly? i mean, if someone started to ask you a question (keep in mind it must happen a LOT for the parisians and they\'re going to get sick of it) with a very, very heavy accent and sloppy english that doesn\'t make much sense, how are you to help them?  \ni\'m sorry for being so straightforward about it. but next time you visit, you may want to understand the city better. paris is wonderful, the people are incredible and the entire city oozes with a very, very pleasant vibe. you may have even ruined the trip for yourself by convincing yourself that you didn\'t like the city.

	 'question': u"\n    I just got back from travelling through Europe. I went all over and France was one of my last stops.. Paris for 2 weeks and my god. I have never felt so unwelcome and so much like a tourist before.  \r\n \r\nThe young girls around my age would just stare at what I was wearing?! Not that I was wearing anything bad.. They did this so obviously too. \r\n \r\nI got lost on my second night there and panicked as I had no clue where I had ended up on the train and how I would ever find my way back.  To cut a long story short, it took me 6 hours to make my way back and I was crying at one point and I had some revolting French guy try to hit on me. I went into a cafe to buy a crepe to calm myself down and some other sleazy guy told me how beautiful I was and started discussing me really loudly to the other staff he was working with. \r\nNot one person approached me when I was crying.. Clearly I looked lost and confused but no. Thank god for meeting a lovely English guy who directed me and even went out of his way to go on a different train line so I was safe and sound. \r\n \r\nI was so pestered under the Eiffel Tower on my third day.. I had two random guys in gorilla outfits just run up to me and kiss me and grabbed me for a photo. I said no I had to be somewhere and one of them got me into such a tight hug I couldn't move. They took the photo and demanded money. They kept following me until I gave them some. And then I was sitting minding my own business and some guy sat next to me and touched my leg, he didn't even know me?! \r\n \r\nI learnt French so I know a bit but not much, anytime I attempted it, people would just look at me, chuckle and roll their eyes.  \r\nI was at gare du nord train station making my way back to England (thank god) and asked the lady at the information desk about if I could change my ticket time. She asked rudely if I was English and even though I said no, she didn't even end up answering my question and the next person in line just pushed in. \r\n \r\nIs this just Paris that is like this? Cause it was just shocking to me. I understand I don't speak the language, I understand France has the most tourists per year out of every country in the world. But I was nothing but civilised, friendly, smiled and did attempt to speak French during my time there.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nThat is a racist question, and please don\'t deny that it is.  \n \nMore often than not, when a white male marries a Mexican girl, he usually admits to liking "dark meat", as some of you like to say.  \n \nWhichever one is the lucky one in the marriage (usually the white one, as they want the dark ones badly like some kind of badge of honor) depends on each circumstance.          \nMexican is a nationality, not a race.

Different people can own different layers.  Like here in the US there are lots of places where an individual owns the surface, but the government owns the minerals (which are obviously underneath the surface).  So if they decide to go after those minerals...they can tear up your land.          \nNegative. Most people don't even have mineral rights to their property.          \nDon't think so funny girl.          \nNot always.  While many people do own both the surface and mineral rights to their property many do not.  They can be sold separately.  If someone owns the mineral rights they own everything beneath the soil- they can remove any water, coal or any other minerals (obviously) underground.  If someone owns the mineral rights to the property you own the surface rights to, they can dig up all your land to get to the minerals they rightfully own. \r\nIf you're interested in more, try reading up on the coal mines of West Virginia. \r\n \r\ngood luck with your new nation :)          ",

	{'answer': u'\nI agree with you about the term "African-American." Not all dark-skinned people come from Africa--and not all of them were born there in the US. There are many CAUCASIAN people in Africa--and in my experience, several REAL "African-American" people I\'ve actually known were actually Caucasian--one was from Morocco and one was from South Africa, and came from Dutch ancestry. Neither one of these was dark-skinned or even close to black.  \n \nThe government and some politically correct well-meaning people have tried to "gentrify" the language to exclude COLOR--because they believe that pointing out colors is wrong or bad. It\'s not always--mostly it\'s descriptive--but that\'s the society we live in. And it\'s not important. Racism is not dead, not by a long shot. Not anywhere. You\'re absolutely correct that racist problems are driven by skin color. At least in this country for the most part. And I also agree that muddying these terms only adds to confusion and misinformation.  \n \nBut that\'s what we have. And we have to live with it until something better comes along or we figure out how to speak about it without the sensitivity it causes.          \nThe only people who prefer the term "African American" over Black are the ones who for some reason think the word "Black" is a racial slur...          \nI think the term "African-American" was developed to make fun of "retarded" racists.  You see, racist Americans would discriminate against "black" Americans, segregate them, and tell them to go back to the jungle in Africa.  Even if the "black" person had blonde hair and blue eyes, but had some black ancestor 5 generations back, they\'d still be segregated.  But if an unmixed dark skinned black student came from Sub-Saharan Africa, they wouldn\'t be subject to segregation.          \nYes, it annoys me as well.  I am white, born and raised in the UK.  However, I am not called a White American or a British American; so why on earth have things changed so drastically that we accept Asian American, Chinese American, Mexican American, etc., etc.  If we are born here, or naturalized we are still AMERICAN!          ',
	 'question': u'\n    OK, I\'m a language Nazi and really resent the way my culture (American) eliminates perfectly acceptable words and replaces them with new words that mean the exact same thing.  "Retarded" is my classic example.  It\'s short for "developmentally retarded", which is an accurate description of that malaise.  But I\'m not allowed to say the word I grew up with any more, I have to say "differently abled" or some nonsense like that.  Don\'t get me started on midgets and "little people". \n \nSo sometime in my lifetime, the race formerly known as "black" became "African-American".  This bothers me because it obscures the issue.  The antipathy held by the power structure in the US isn\'t directed toward a continent of origin.  Nobody ever has any problem with Africa itself, or Africans.  Heck, I lived next door to an African-American.  He was white, and fled S Africa at the fall of apartheid.  He never got stop-and-frisked.  The problems in this country(and racial problems everywhere) are all based on skin color and nothing else. \n \nAnyway, I\'d like to hear from anyone who genuinely prefers "African-American" to "Black".  If you do, why do you prefer the term?  Don\'t you see that it just adds a layer of misinformation about racial stuff, and helps white people ignore the fact that racism is alive and well in this country?  ',

	{'answer': u"\nIn case you didn&#x27;t notice, Mexico is Multiracial Country, They have Whites,  Asians,  Blacks, Indians,  Arabs.  \n \nNOT ALL MEXICANS ARE BROWN,  Some turn brown because they&#x27;re in the Sun or work in the Sun too much.          \nWhy did Michel Jackson want to be white.Why does a girl with long straight hair want curly brown hair.If your fat you want to be skinny if your skinny you want to gain weight.If your poor you want to be rich if your rich you want to be richer.People are missing something in their heart, a relationship with God. Until that gap is filled no one is happy with the way they are. Seems to me anyway.          \nSo just because I fell in love with someone different that automatically makes me a self-hater? You honestly think I fell in love with his race? Wow.. you obviously don't understand I fell in love with another human being. Why should something as dumb as race stop me from being happy stop me from being happy? I love him and he loves me and that's all I care about.          \nI&#x27;m Mexican and I hate interracial mixing but if I had to mix it would t be a gringo, why do you think we want to be white? That&#x27;s asians who do not us, we don&#x27;t even like gringos that&#x27;s why we call you gringo and you guys hate in us all the time!!!! And we live in the ghetto with blacks and Arabs.          \nDepends on the person, maybe they genuinely liked someone. Maybe they do have a caste mentality.

	{'answer': u"\nyeah, pretty much. \r\nlol \r\n \r\nI feel the same way, haha... grr those frenchies are annoying!          \nIt sounds like you've just had some bad experience with the French, so now you're generalizing... \r\nI'm sure not ALL French people are like that. :)          \nthey have a superiority complex          \nC'est pas tout monde qui est chaleureux but i am i wont b mad at you if ya dont speak perfect french or speak english to me ^^          \n...all of the French people I've met have been extremely nice to me, even though I horribly butchered their language... \r\n \r\nI think you're just generalizing based on a few bad experiences.          \nActually I've had very few of those rude experiences. Only two, in fact. I had as much or more rudeness in London, and I would still say Londoners by and large were delightful. \r\n \r\nOn another occasion I had a lady get snippy and end the conversation when she found out I was American. But that conversation was in French. And that was the only time I encountered anti-Americanism. \r\n \r\nAnd I assure you, my accent and vocabulary would not fool any French person into thinking I was fluent.          \nI don't mind at all when someone speaks poor French. I live in a mostly bilingual town, so it's pretty common here.          \nIn my anecdotal experience French people are rude when I speak English and don't try to speak French. I guess we have met different people.          \nYou shouldn't generalise people. But, it's safe to say that some people will get offended if you don't speak their language, especially if you're forcing them to speak your language. Never force your own. It's impolite. Try putting yourself in their shoes. I strongly suggest you master the French language and don't forget your accent. A language is not without an accent. If you are to go to some place, you should learn the language of the locals. Never expect them to speak your language. You learn theirs. Not the other way around. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.          \nPeople who learn a language, know how difficult it is. \nPeople who do not, criticize.          \nThey do love to hate people, that's true.   \r\nBut it's mainly because France is full of tourists often, and the locals get fed up with it and just want to carry on with their everyday lives without having to deal with someone who speaks very bad French and can't find their way to the hotel. \r\nThat said, they (we) are a nation of angry people who love to hate, go on strike and start protests.          \nIt is a bit of a stereotype, but I have experienced some interesting reactions of native French speaking people. (I am fluent in the Parisian variety). \r\nIn Quebec, the mainly French speaking province of Canada. I found that the native Quebecois feel that they are looked down as inferior with their ancient patois. When one speaks French French. they answer then in their broken English. \r\nI was member of a government delegation from Canada to France. We had a civil servant who was from Quebec and he insisted to address the Chamber of Commerce in Paris in his patois until a french delegate stood up, interrupted him and asked that he should speak English since nobody would understand his alleged French. \r\nSo they are rude to their own people and heritage. Don't take it too seriously, though. I still love them all, arrogance and conceit and all. It's just a shield from their own deficiencies.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    Of course I speak French to French people, but I'm not very good at the language and when I talk to them they refuse to talk back and say I'm talking in some foreign language. I did the same thing with Germans, they were not rude but politely corrected me. The French hate when people speak English to them and they also hate when people don't speak perfect French, either? \r\n \r\nDo the French just love to hate people, or what?  ",

Clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots. \n \nPsalm 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. \n \nProverbs 18:7 A fool\'s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. \n \nProverbs 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. \n \nHalleluYAH - praise ye the LORD!          \nBecause Christians don\'t agree with your opinion. Thanks for sharing. \n \n""your opinion" Reality is not an opinion." \n - Reality is not. What you claim to be reality is. Thanks for sharing.          \nThat\'s easy. It\'s because it isn\'t impossible or ridiculous to them.          \nPlease look up the dictionary definition of belief.  It has nothing to do with evidence, plausibility, or consistency. \n \nIt\'s belief, nothing more nor less.          \nBecause I don\'t find it so impossible or ridiculous.          \nSame reason Muslims believe the Quran: Faith.          \nRevelation sums it all up.  It spells out the end game, same end game the dinosaurs had.          \nIN Logic class this kind of statement is used to illustrate how an idiot thinks. \n \nMany do, so if it were ridiculous it would put the burden on YOU and not on them. I mean that is the logic of it. You admit the facts : \n \n1) Many believe \n2) It is ridiculous and \nQED what does that prove ? That you have no explanation.  \n \nBut you are too illogical to see how dumb what you say is.          \nthey are indoctrinated into that religion from a very young age. In all actuality most of the people that believe in Christianity were just brought up to the faith, they didn\'t made the choice. Christianity is vicious hoax bestowed upon humanity to enslave the credulous minds. \n \nRid yourself of Christianity  \n \nChrist only came here for the lost sheep of Israel \n \nMatthew 15:24 \n \nplease visit  \nExposing Christianity.com \nJoy of Satan.com          \nI\'ll stand up for my beliefs, but why do you indulge in it if you don\'t believe?  No ones forcing you to; so why ask stupid questions?          \nWhy do you think its ridiculous?  There are so many books and resources to assure you of why the Bible is the most authentic book and one of history that exists bar none.  Read a book by Josh McDowell called " Evidence that Demands a Verdict" (several volumes) Hope this helps          \nBecause down throughout the ages it\'s been tested and found to be true, working in the same way in our lives now as it was back then.  These days we have a more rounded philosophy, but the human experience has been one of anguish and joy.  If we need words of Wisdom for those times of anguish, why not during times of joy?          \nwow, I hate people like you, your a hypocritical, bigoted moron who obviously has no life if you don\'t have anything better to do then make fun of Christians! You say that Christians are delusional but obviously you are too if you think that doing things like this are a good idea.          \nHow can you call talking snakes, 900 year old people, animals on a boat, zombies, magic sky deities and guys who have superpowered hair &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot;? They&#x27;re in the bible, so clearly they&#x27;re true!          \nOnly Sola Scriptura Protestants do, like fundamentalists. \n \nMost of us understand that the Jews were recording THEIR perspective on what they thought God expected of them.  \nJesus spent quite a bit of time telling them they misunderstood most of it.          \nA lucid person will say that we&#x27;re the product of a vast mind. Not the byproducts of mindless biological processes. \n \nOk we can agree there is a God then. Who is he? \n \nWe can survey religious texts. The bible stands out supremely. \n \nDoes that answer your question? You&#x27;re heaving around terms like impossible and ridiculous suggests nothing but arguments based on insanity would satisfy you, given what I assume you believe about origins, human or otherwise. Have a great day.          \nPersonally I just think god puts people in out lives like you to test us and see how we defend our religion. If you do think you are getting into peoples minds saying this... You aren&#x27;t :)          \nThey lack the ability to think it through. If you were unkind you would say they are a bit thick          \nJesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God." Luke 18:27          \nI find it laughable that anyone would say that the Bible is not the Word of God and impossible, much less ridiculous.  ANYTHING is possible in reality.  What is not PROBABLE is often considered as impossible and your assertion that the Bible actually being the Word of God is ridiculous, is YOUR OWN opinion.  It isn\'t fact.  You can\'t say something isn\'t possible when it exists unless you have proof that the possible isn\'t what it appears to be.  You don\'t have that proof.  No one does, where the actual written words are concerned because not one single person is alive that was there when the words were first formed.  And ridiculousness becomes absurdity in the face of ignorance and lack of proof.          \nAtheists are a joke..dont be conned by atheists.  \n \nProbability and Order Versus Evolution  \nby Henry Morris, Ph.D.  \n \nOne of the strongest direct evidences for special creation is the existence of innumerable highly complex systems in the universe, systems composed of components occurring in a pattern of "order" rather than disorder. Creationists maintain that highly ordered systems could not arise by chance, since random processes generate disorder rather than order, simplicity rather than complexity and confusion instead of "information."  \n \nFor example, consider a series of ten flash cards, numbered from one to ten. If these are thoroughly and randomly mixed, and then laid out successively in a linear array along the table, it would be extremely unlikely that the numbers would fall out in order from one to ten. Actually, there are 3,628,800 different ways in which these numbers could be arranged, so that the "probability" of this particular ordered arrangement is only one in 3,628,800. (This number is "ten factorial," written as 10!, and can be calculated simply by multiplying together all the numbers from one to ten.)  \n \nIt is obvious that the probability of such a numerically ordered arrangement decreases rapidly as the number of components increases. For any linear system of 100 components in specified order, the probability is one in 100!, or one chance in 10158 (a number represented by "one followed by 158 zeroes").  \n \nA system requiring such a high degree of order could never happen by chance. This follows from the fact that probability theory only applies to systems with a finite possibility of occurring at least once in the universe, and it would be inconceivable that 10158 different trials could ever be made in our entire space-time universe.  \n \nAstro-physicists estimate that there are no more than 1080 infinitesimal "particles" in the universe, and that the age of the universe in its present form is no greater than 1018 seconds (30 billion years). Assuming each particle can participate in a thousand billion (1012) different events every second (this is impossibly high, of course), then the greatest number of events that could ever happen (or trials that could ever be made) in all the universe throughout its entire history is only 1080 x 1018 x 1012, or 10110 (most authorities would make this figure much lower, about 1050). Any event with a probability of less than one chance in 10110, therefore, cannot occur. Its probability becomes zero.  \n \nThus, the above-suggested ordered arrangement of 100 components has a zero probability. It could never happen by chance. Since every single living cell is infinitely more complex and ordered than this, it is impossible that even the simplest form of life could ever have originated by chance. Even the simplest replicating protein molecule that could be imagined has been shown by Golay1 to have a probability of one in 10450.  \nThere are only 10 to the 82nd power atoms in the entire universe. Numbers don\'t lie , atheists do.  \n \nTrue followers of God must avoid mixing with wordily people or you might get tricked into worshipping Satan as they do.  \n \nDoes avoiding atheists imply that our faith is not strong enough to discern truth from falsehood? That our faith is not strong enough to discuss different views? Not at all. In our ministry, we discuss with those who have different views. Atheists differ from those we meet in our ministry. Atheists are not sincere in their expressions. Their aim is to manipulate your mind, and undermine your faith. (Psalm 12:2 read) With good reason, the Bible then tells us to avoid Atheists, just as we would avoid a person who was infected with a deadly contagious disease. (1 John 2:18-19 read)  \n \nBecause they oppose the truth, Atheists are part of the Anti-Christ. They are liars and deceivers, out to destroy your relationship with God and his son, Christ Jesus. Therefore, we want to avoid them, for they are not of our sort. (Deuteronomy 32:46-47 read)  \n \nLike Satan, Atheists are unruly men who cook up wicked reasonings and season their brew with poisonous lies that deceive minds. Their preference is to partake of falsehood at the table of demons. Atheists are part of the seed of the serpent spoken of at Genesis 3 verse 15. If we wish to please God, we cannot be feeding at his table and at the same time be nibbling at the table of demons, eating from the hands of Satan\u2019s helpers \u2013 Atheists          ',

	{'answer': u'\nTHESE ARE THE FIRST ONES....NONE OF US LIVED BEFORE...          \nI was a cockroach.          \nBefore I was born, there was nothing but billions of years of nothingness. The same will happen after I die. Believing otherwise is at best wishful thinking if you ask me.          \nThen you really don\'t understand how "past lives" work or what their purpose is.   \n \nWe are here again and again to learn how to love unconditionally.  In your past lives, you may have been those things, but chances are pretty darn good that at one point in time or another, you were also a cannibal, at one point you were a slave, a slave owner, a murderer, a criminal, and other greedy, selfish things that young souls do when they are mostly ego, and know very little about love.  \n \nIn any case, if you are talented and blessed with those gifts, use them wisely, and don\'t forget to grow in love.          \nYou just believed a lie from Satan. \nYou just made this up, people have no memories of past lives, only wishful thinking. \nBy reincarnation, people excuse themselves for sinning and doing evil, thinking they can fix it in the next life. \n \nGod gives us only one life to repent and believe in His Son Jesus Christ, those who do will get to God\'s Kingdom of Heaven. \nAll the rest who refused to believe and repent, will be thrown into Gehenna, the burning lake.          \nI&#x27;m like Ganondorf... while others come and go, in different incarnations, my hatred lives on, growing more powerful over centuries...

	{'answer': u'\nIt\'s because of what some may argue is their "backwards and socially retarded culture". They subjugate and physically cover up women, so men don\'t see women as equal human beings. Because they are covered up so much, and because of they are so sexually repressed, the men in those countries fetishize any part of a woman\'s flesh so they think behaviour like this appropriate.          \nYou are a white girl from the UK, did no research on the culture, and now complain when the culture offends you?   \n \nYou should think things through a little bit more.  While I agree that behavior is messed up, it\'s their country, their culture, and over there, it\'s permitted.  If you are the one willing to risk men groping you all day, that\'s your own fault due to lack of research and knowledge of another foreign country you are travelling to.  This should be pretty much common knowledge, if you are going somewhere, you should know details on the damn society.          \ndepends where in the middle east i went to dubai i saw all races black,white asian.  im a british muslim i wore western clothes didnt do that to me, they are all nice.          \nlike this? \n \n          ',

	{'answer': u"\nEnglish is considered a complex language and is considered quite hard to learn. English has large variation in sentence structure, German would be a better option.          \nI'm not sure what you are asking. \n \nIf you're asking whether English shold be the worlds dominant language, the answer is no. There's too many things worth saying that can't be expressed in English. \n \nI think there shouldn't be a dominant language at all. What we need is a common shared SECOND language. One that's easier to learn than the national/ethnic ones, that doesn't belong to any country, religion or ethnic group. Until something even better comes along, I support Esperanto for that role          \nAbsolutely not. It is only as widespread as it is because of military and economic imperialism of the past. As the dominance of the UK and the US fades, the usefulness of English will fade as well.          \nNo. English-speaking people take up only 30% of the world.          \nMore people than ever are learning English as it has become the international lingua franca for almost everything, particularly in business. Although I am a native speaker I think it would be a terrible shame if other languages declined because of English. Although in some places this appears to be the case where local languages are disappearing due to linguistic imperialism. It would be a very boring world indeed if we all spoke the same language.

All the travel sites seem to be trying to get me to book a flight, and like I said, I\'m nowhere near that stage. I just want to figure out how much money to save before I even bother trying to book a flight. \r\n \r\nSo my question is this: does anyone know where I can find flight estimates WITHOUT pretending to be booking a ticket? There are too many specific factors I want to include (like the two separate destinations; and I want to agree to as many layovers as possible, as my friend tells me that layovers will get you discounts), so getting a decent estimate from a site that\'s trying to get me to book a flight is hard. Any site I\'ve gone to wants to make me fill out a \'search for a flight!\' form, and when I do it that way, I can\'t specify the multiple destinations and the desire for layovers. \r\n \r\nAnyone that can help me will be much appreciated! I will "best answer" the most helpful! \r\n \r\n \r\nADDITIONAL: Please don\'t just give me a link to another travel site that\'s going to make me do the same thing!

	{'answer': u'\nYour son is over 18.  You will have to wait until (if) you become a citizen to sponsor his immigration.  Legal permanent residents cannot sponsor immigrants.  If you become a citizen and sponsor him, it depends what country he is a citizen of and how long the line is from that country.  Could be 5 - 15 years.  If you just got your green card, 6 years or so before you actually get citizenship.  If immigration applications continue to increase, it could be longer by that time.          \nYes but it takes between 8 to 14 years at present depending on the country of origin. If he gets married then you have to be a citizen.          \nNo.  He is too old and you need to be a citizen first          \nJust about everything ibu guru told you is false. "Your son is over 18. You will have to wait until (if) you become a citizen to sponsor his immigration." That is 100% false. \r\n \r\n"Legal permanent residents cannot sponsor immigrants." That is 100% false. \r\n \r\nLawful permanent residents can petition for their spouses, their children and their unmarried sons and daughters.

	{'answer': u'\nhmm.. if u\'ve done the proper steps.. then u shouldn\'t have any problems \r\nmaybe u didn\'t place the ink correctly and fix it, that\'s y it goes good then blank again.  \r\nor \r\nmaybe the ink in the cartridge had dried up??          \nYou got what you bargained for.  Inkjet cartridges are not meant to be refilled, despite what re-fillers would have you believe.  Ink formulations are proprietary, so after market producers cannot exactly duplicate it.  The fact that it does not work should not be too much of a surprise.  If you are refilling because of cost, consider getting a Kodak printer.  Their new refills sell for about half of what everybody else\'s sells for. \r\n \r\nedit 1) The evidence that refilling does not actually work, is in your printer.  And yes, some companies thrive selling crap.  Take fast food for example.  It is rubbish, but people buy it anyway, just like refilled ink tanks.          \nIt seems that you have got the refilling from a wrong person or your printer was idle for more time. \r\n \r\nSolution:  \r\n \r\n1. See if you cartridge is properly fitted in the printer and the printer status moniter properly detects the cartridge. If not fit it properly. \r\n \r\n2. Your cartridge head might have block due to overage of time. \r\n \r\nJust soak you cartridge in luke warm water for 5-10 min. do not dip your cartridge fully in water, then take it out and press it lightly on a tissue paper, here the ink should flow quickly. \r\n \r\nIf nothing is one your tissue, then take isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab and clean it gently. and damp on clean tissue.  \r\n \r\nIf these do not work, then just purchase a new cartridge, and be happy.          \nWell assuming that 40 is a heavier consistency than 37 what you have done is blocked the print heads and possibly damaged the heater inside it. \r\n \r\nYour only choice is now to have the print head replaced in the printer. \r\n \r\nTake this a lesson that refilling cartridges is a false economy and never works properly.          \nThe ink cartridges for your printer is PG 40 & CL 41. \r\n \r\n \r\nPlease make sure you got the right cartridges for your printer. Then if the refilled ink cartridges not working, please follow these instructions below: \r\n1) Turn on the printer; take out the cartridges \r\n2) Turn off the printer for a few minutes \r\n3) Turn on the printer, when it says "insert inks", and then insert the compatible cartridges one by one, making sure the cartridges are sitting completely in the slots. \r\n \r\nHope you can use your printer very soon.          \nit is very easy to refill ink cartridges          \nI do not know why people buy refills ink to fill there cartridges up with, when you can buy compatible cartridges that will do the job for half the price, I have been using compatible cartridges now for over ten years with different printers without any trouble at all, the printer that I am using now is a epson and I can get the compatible cartridges for it for \xa31.85, if I buy 12 then I can get them for \xa31.65 and there no mess          \nYour cartridge isn\'t actually filled correctly, your print head is far to dry leading to an inconsistent print. \r\n \r\nMany refilling companies actually are going out of business as they do experience about a 25% failure rate. \r\n \r\nThe only reason they have survived for so long is they inject about $0.04 worth of ink and charge you $15. \r\n \r\nThose cartridges are among some of the easiest to refill if you have the correct equipment.   I am willing to bet they didn\'t flush the print head, resulting in debris getting caught and negatively impacting your print.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nThey are the most peaceful religion, and they will blow the **** out of your if you say otherwise.          \nReligious leaders are cynical and manipulative - best to get people frightened into following your religion (or at least not criticising or condemning it) so as to make yourself richer.  It's just a marketing exercise for their business.  The sheeple are too stupid to see through it.          \nMuslims are no more aggressive than any other theistic religion. Study history.          \nActually, unlike the average stereotype most Americans put on Muslims, they are not actually. They strive to be peaceful. We are learning about this right now in my history class, and its probably the most interesting thing I've ever learned in this class. We read a quote said by Muhammad. It went something along the lines of 'the only thing better than doing the 5 pillars is being peaceful with one another'.  \r\n \r\nMost Americans think the way they do because the only Muslim they ever hear about is Saddam Husein. Others are a bit more informed, and know that there are two groups, who are usually identified as the 'violent' and 'non-violent'. Actually, the only difference between the groups is that one believes the leader of the religion should be elected and the other believes the leader should be a relative of the prophet. They fight mainly with each other, and that is because they believe God is happy when they fight for what they believe in and win. They also fight any who challenge their beliefs. Hence why they don't like the general Western hemisphere.          \nthe majority of the Muslim population is not aggressive, its only the radicals. We often forget this and base our opinion a giant group of people based on the actions of a small portion if its population.          ",

I also understand that they believe that the west has started another "crusade" and that\'s why they fight. I\'m a christian and i just cant get my head around there aggressive behavior. \r\n \r\nThank you for any help or info\' you guys/girls provide.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nwell Orla C made it sound like prison , me personaly have no problems with Americans , but some facts have to be told , number 1 you\'re American with Irish ancester , thats fine , number 2 it\'s not Irish Gaelic , calling it that makes no sence ,Gaelige or Gaelig ,prounced  Gaylic is what they call it in Donegal in Irish , in the rest of Ireland it\'s called Gaeilge prounced Gael a ga in Irish , in English , it\'s called Irish , calling it Irish Gaelic is basicly saying Irish Irish , the correct word is Irish Goidelic , but again that would be like calling German , German germanic . so it\'s simpley called Irish , number 3 don\'t be ignorant . number 4 stop complaing about the weither it\'s only rain , number 5 be your self . and we know all about american culture          \nYou will be perceived as an American.  No kids your age are going to care if you\'re a descendant of an Irish person, and the only likelihood it would ever come up is if you are doing a project for a history or geography class or writing something specific about you personally say in English class.  They will be curious about America but probably find you interesting.  They will probably only hate you if you\'re an unpleasant person, or if you go on and on and on about how "great" America or how much bigger or better stuff is in America or how "in American we do this....." or "we do this better in America" stuff like that is a major turn off regardless what country you come from.   \n \nI doubt they\'d have issue with your accent.  Probably curious about that too. \n \nNobody says Irish Gaelic.  That doesn\'t exit as a term here, it only exists in the minds of ill informed Americans who claim they are a quarter part Irish but have never even seen Ireland and have no concept of Ireland being a modern country.  English is spoken widely for the majority as a first language, Irish (Gaelige) is taught all the way through school and generally only spoken in school, with exception to those living in Gaeltacht areas.  You may or may not have to learn Irish, for you it would be optional.  You may find other kids your age and younger speak another language as their first language and English as their second.   \n \nIf you like some sports (not American football though) like soccer, play playstation or xbox, films, books, skateboarding, being on a bicycle, music, adventure, and stuff like that, you\'ll probably find that you have a lot in common          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Hi, I'm 14 years old (eighth grade), I live in New York, and in September I'll be moving to Ireland. My father's job was transferred to Dublin; I've known we were moving there since last year, although it's recently just hit me that I'm actually going to be moving to IRELAND. \n \nI am Irish (Irish American that is, my great-grandfather moved here in the early 1900s) and have an Irish last name. Will that make any difference when I move there? \n \nAnyways, I have some questions about what life is like in Ireland- \n \n1. Do people like Americans? I know that a lot of British people don't like us and lots of countries think we're ignorant and annoying. Will the kids hate me because I'm American? \n \n2. Will people think my accent is weird? I don't speak with a heavy New York accent, rather a general American one. Will they hate the way I talk? \n \n3. Does everyone there speak English? I know that they speak Irish Gaelic as well because my great-grandfather was a native speaker, and my grandmother can speak it somewhat. I read that the school I'll be attending is an English language school (well, all the videos and the websites are in English, so I'm assuming.) But what will everyone speak to each other? Do they speak Irish mainly to each other? If so, how long is it going to take me to learn Irish? \n \n4. Do the kids there like the same things? Is the culture similar at all? \n \nThanks! I could ask my parents but they're really stressed rn....I wanted a broader answer from here!  ",

YOU would be mad also if some foreign countries did that to you.          \nWhat is WITH this flood of anti-muslim posts today? \r\n \r\nLook, everything you said about Muslims could also be said of Fundamentalist Christians, okay? Just substitute "the Bible" for "the Koran".  \r\n \r\nAnd Fundie Christians are some of the most hostile, aggressive, violent (watch some videos of Tea Baggers. Read up on the threats to abortion providers and their children!!) people on the planet. \r\n \r\nNormal, moderate, everyday Muslims are no more violent or aggressive than anybody else.  \r\n \r\nSo just stuff your slanted world view - we don\'t want to read about it.          \nyea that doesnt sound like a nice life at all. Religion that puts such stupid barriers on people should be ashamed of itself. And I dont just mean the muslim faith, i mean all religions. Its no wonder people turn out the way they do when they are opressed by things such as religion. Even where I live, the Catholic church rules the land, basically, and for years people have been made to feel ashamed for the stupidest or naturalest of things. I heard recently the pope has said that IVF treatment is a sin, and if you cant have children you just have to live without. What a load of tripe. Thankfully i see changes coming though, the youth are not as gullible anymore and wont swallow it.          \nhow can you say that muslims are aggressive, what has religion gotta do with muslims being aggressive?! i dont get that Lol cause theirs alot of cultures in the world but you cant just say muslims are agressive because of stupid reasons like "not having sex before marriage" thats got nothing to do with being agressive muslims its just what we believe, other cultures can have as much aggression as muslims, muslims dont have to fast btw or read the whole "Quran" (its not koran) off my heart its up to them how they lead their life but we believe in fasting because we get to have that experience of what poor people have to deal with in the life today.          \nI  do not believe "your" answer is correct.  For U perhaps?  It\'s always is so easy to pick fault with others, their religion, or anything  else for that matter.  What is a negative to U, perhaps even to me at times; Is not necessarily to others.  This is where "respect" comes in.   It is difficult at times, however; we must,  MUST, RESPECT OTHERS, THEIR WAYS;  including the religions they practice.  I am a Roman Catholic by birth, yet I do understand the men\'s thoughts on how females in general are demoralized here in America..media;  "they are right"!   Anyone who disagrees with that: (in my opinion, needs more moralizing themselves. (Plus a few ethics courses, I might add).  What kinds of junk are we exposing our children/men to?  Don\' most of you all out there feel it only contributes to the crimes against women?  Statistics show  illicit-pornography surely IS the culprit there/here from Internet\'s.  Adults who are mature, Parents, especially;  all understand this.  Plus, would probably honor the female, woman, wife, girl children and "all other relatives" it would pertain to,  in a different light if we could adjust our own practices and thinking.  It\'s just  quite differently here in America, as well as other places;  (but with more respect we could curtail many problems.) That\'s a given.  This is just one of the venues for discussion about "their ways."  I think Muslims have some good ideas,."praying several times a day" just another example. We should be that great/dedicated!   I mean it!  "Not the terrorist stuff, of course, as I believe "they just use the Museums as a front!"  There are plenty of good loving Muslims, even here in America, as well as abroad.  The others, who worship their God, be it my God Jesus Christ,  or their own should be "respected" above all.          \nHave You Studied Some Statistics On (Abortion...Single Mothers...etc?) And The Causes For That? Do You Know The Biological And Psychological Effects Of Interacting Too Freely With The Opposite Sex (Extra-Marital Affairs....Divorce...Breakups...Betrayal... Do You Know The Scientific Link Between The Type Of Music We Hear And Its Impact On Our Thinking, Speech, & Behaviors? Do You Understand The Social Impact Of What You Wear? Do You Know The Wisdom Behind The Restrictions Of Certain Food? Too Much Of Games Is Never Good (Do Some Research On It)...And "Muslims Cannot Read Lots Of Book" is a Myth...The 1st Word Of Quran Revealed Was "Iqra" means "Read"...Reading Is Highly Encouraged As Long As Its Beneficial...I Don\'t Think So Learning The Quran Is That Difficult...It\'s Just As Interesting As Reading Your Favorite Book/Novel/Magazine Again And Again...Go And Read Some Medical And Moral Benefits Of Fasting... \r\n \r\nYou\'ll Be More Shocked To See The Statistic Of Murder, Rape, Robbery, Abuse, And Any Type Of Domestic Violence Among The Non-Muslims To See Their True Level Of Aggressiveness....

Any time you win something, you don\'t have to pay to receive it or give out you bank information.          \nDon\'t even click on it it\'s a scam i have seen it before don\'t even click on it it\'s just trying to get your computer infected with a virus          \nSave your money hon, if you didn\'t enter, you didn\'t win...and no lottery is going to ask you to send them fees so they can send you a check, there\'s also more to it than getting an email from them. \r\n \r\nSearch your memory and you\'ll probably discover that you never entered this and thus by not sending them money you are not making THEM win the lottery. \r\n \r\nTake care,          \nSCAM          \nIt is a crooked scheme, do not send money, you will not hear from them again if you send money.

	{'answer': u'\nBoiling water and poke it with a stick.          \nFirst pour OXYCLEAN powder down the drain, then add a pot of boiling hot water, and wait for awhile.  Try the drain and see if its still backed up.          \nBleach will disolve anything.  I don\'t know if something like Draino would work better.  Bleach has very harsh fumes that will make your eyes and throat burn so be careful if try it.          \nDepending on how far down it is in the drain...You may be able to pull it out.  One time, I had a cork inside a wine bottle.  I used about 12" of a wire clothes hanger, bent it in half into a shape like tweezers and I was able to grab the cork and pull it out through the bottleneck.  You could try something similar to pull the soap out of the drain.  Good luck!          \npull the cover off the overflow pipe the silver plate under the spout. Use a coat hanger to wiggle around as far as you can get it in the overflow pipe. If that doesn\'t work tru a good old fashioned plunger. Plug the overflow hole with a wet rag to form suction, then plunge the hell out of it. if that doesn\'t work call your local ServiceExperts office          \nSoap will go down with hot  water  every easy  & it also will mealt in hot water  so  gust  try to send  hot or bollig water with prsure down your pipe & be sure it will mealt that pice of soap          \nI wold use a clothes hanger and try to break it up a little,if you can reach it ...and hot water will dissolve the soap...sooner or later it will dissolve and be clear...just keep at it ..          \nWell a couple of insertions of a plumbers snake might do well.

All this happened after a highschool student neighbor of my mom's used the computer for his school work. He tried to fix it himself only to make it worse, and he said it wouldn't print when he sat down to use it, so that's why I had to get hp to fix the printer problem after I tried troubleshooting it. His mom paid for it all. He should have told my mom it wouldn't print instead of trying to fix the computer.  Anyways, I had to reinstall microsoft office 2010 after hp had fixed it, and my mom sat down to print something yesterday, and the default printer was switched to One note. I googled it, and it says microsoft office is to blame, but why does it do this? I had to change the default printer back to the HP today, and now everything works again.  ",

	 'question': u"\n    This girl in my art class is a year younger and she's one of my good friends. She's really cute and funny and one of the coolest people you'll ever meet. Last couple days, we've grown really close. I suck at art and she's a whiz, so she's been flirting with me a lot and teaching me art etc.. and I don't know how I feel about that. It seems like she likes me sometimes but I can't be sure. Yesterday she was teaching me something about shading in art and on impulse I grabbed her hand. She was really surprised but didn't let go until the class ended 30 minutes later. It was really casual and comfortable and I'd love to ask her out.  \n \nIt's weird though, because we haven't talked to each other until like 3 days ago. I don't even have her phone number.

I feel like she could also be using me to get into prom, since I'm a junior. Actually I wasn't concerned about that until my friend told me that she's the kind of girl to do such a thing.

	{'answer': u'\nThat\'s a good idea. When you are in your room, keep an eye on your cat. Discipline him every time he gets into a plant. Eventually, discipline him when he starts looking at a plant with intention in his posture.  \n \nI have not been professionally advised about disciplining cats, but I suddenly inherited two of them. So what I started doing was\u2014well, here\'s one example. The cats wanted to rush into my room at my bedtime. They had never been trained about staying out of a certain room, so they were in the habit of going wherever they wanted to.  \n \nSo I did it 1/ psychologically. I felt masterful. 2/ I sounded masterful. I spoke in a loud, low voice. I picked up a cane, and I waved it at her. I said "NO!!"  "NO,  YOU CAN\'T GO IN THERE!" if she kept crouching, and staring at the door opening as if it were prey, I\'d say "NO, DON\'T EVEN THINK ABOUT." Just to make the loud voice last longer, not because they could understand. If she persisted in her intentions, I stuck the cane out and poked her softly with it while saying "NO." 3/ I gave her a reward. Not food, but I made my voice all syrupy and said, "GOOD GIRRRRRLL!!  a few times.  \n \nFirst it worked that way. \n \nNext, it worked just by my staring at her and holding the cane and saying NO! She didn\'t move, and then looked away. \n \nNext, I didn\'t say anything, just held the cane and stuck it out toward her a bit. \n \nNext I didn\'t have to do anything except check.  No cane, even. Then I\'d say  "GOOOD GIIRRRRRLS" in the or she didn\'t move, or look with intention to spring forth and run through the door. (You can really "read a cat\'s mind" by their body posture.)  \n \nAnd NOW, almost always, they will not even BE in my room at my bedtime. They will have gone to sleep in their favorite spots. That amazed me the most.  \n \nYou are going to do this training in steps, and it will probably take a few days to complete. Start with just you and him in the room doing your routine with your plants, when he goes near one, first when he\'s actually physically touching one.  You walk over and say NO in that loud voice, pick him up gently but firmly and put him down gently and if he doesn\'t make a beeline for the plant again, you say in a loud syrupy voice,  \n"GOOOOOD BOHYY!!!"  a few times. That day, every time he goes near the plant, do the same thing. NO and some other loud words, and pick him up and move him away.  (If he turns it into a power struggle, just put him outside the room for awhile. Let him in and try it sll over again. Next step, but not the same day, use a cane or a stick. Never hit him with it, just poke him or shove him a little AWAY from the plant, while you talk in a loud voice if he doesn\'t listen to your voice alone.  Just point the stick toward him, eventually.  In between, when he is ignoring the plants, tell him what a good boy he is, and other things like that, in your singing voice. Next step. Put the cane away and just use your voice. NO loud and low if he moves toward the plant, and high sing-song talking in between. And then fall silent, and like read or something and see what he does.   Eventually, you might only say NO once.  Always use the loud low voice for discipline and at no other times.  Do as little as possible, for it to work, getting less and less all the time.  Finally, when he is never walking towards the plants, tell him a whole lot what a good boy he is. Remember, NOT walking towards a plant is a behavior, too, so you want to reward for good behavior.  I DO think they like the praise, but this is the first time I\'ve ever tried to train a cat, because I have not had any cats for YEARS!!          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I have a cat that likes to tear up house plants. I started growing some tomato sprouts and right now it's not a big deal because I have a cover over them. I don't have anywhere I can move them where he can't get to AND where the plants would get sun. The only thing I can think of is to lock him out of my room (where the plants are) 24/7 until I can put the tomatoes outside.  \n \nThe thing is I'm his favorite person. Where I am, he has to be. If I have him locked out of a room I'm in, he meows and sticks his paws under the door. Even when I go to the bathroom.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nYou\'re gonna go for a lil\' swim.          \nThe plane lands on the water at a slow speed. And then you will have to wait for a boat.          \nLook out for the whitetips.          \nYou never fly to a place from which you cannot land safely within certain time limits. Long flights are full of alternatives along the way.          \nYou did not say which type of emergency - \n \nWith a twin engine, such as a 767, they are ETOPS and have landing airports - \nA friend of mine was flying with US Air as 767 captain - \nHe once had to land in Iceland, nasty winter weather and fog... on one engine - \nHe told me the diversion was the longest 90 minutes in his life - \n \nI used to fly airplanes with 4 engines - 707, 747... even 3 engines is ok - \nAn engine fails, you still have all options... continue, go back - no worries - \n \nAtlantic emergency airfields are... \nGander (Canada) - Keflavik (Iceland) - Lajes (Azores) - Shannon (Ireland) - \n \nOr... you better know how to swim - and your nickname not be "Sharkbait" - \n.          \nWhen crossing remote areas, aircraft usually have diversion airports planned. ETPs (equal time points) are plotted along the route to tell you which airport you are going to if something goes wrong. \r\n \r\nCrossing the Atlantic for example, you will reach an ETP between say Goose Bay and Keflavik. If anything goes wrong before that particular ETP, you go to Goose Bay, anything after and you go to Keflavik. There will be another ETP between Keflavik and maybe Shannon or Prestwick and so on... \r\n \r\nIf it\'s so bad that you can\'t make it to an airport, then you crash.          \nCAN YOU SWIM.  ( On a Boeing Jet, if there\'s an emergency concerning a engine, that engine will be dropped and the other engine can handle the whole flight alone without any problem. I retired from Boeing and I know the Boeing aircraft is the safest best flying aircraft in the skies).   Mike          ',

	{'answer': u'\nGo to the gardens in Ocho Rios.  They have all sorts of local plants...and also have 2 of the largest and most fragrant cannabis plants I\'ve ever seen.  True story.          \ngo see the green grotto caves.  river rafting.  go up blue mountain its beautiful, coffee place up the mountain is great and theres a place to stop and see the biggest bottle of rum and get the taste of all sorts, leave feeling real happy. the veiws up there are great.          \nthe scuba / snorkling is not good in Jamaica,  the prob is that the gov\'t didn\'t have any kind of preservation plan in place so now the reefs are shot.  Although this will be overrun with cruise folk, you may want to try the \'origional canopy tour\'  it is a total blast.          \nWe were in Jamaica last month and stayed about 15 minutes from Ocho Rios (Runaway Bay) and did visit Ocho Rios.  We went to Dunns River Falls which is very cool.  We also did the Canopy Jungle Tour which is a series of zip lines  you go down.  Very thrilling!  This trip was out of Chukka Cove which had cycling, horseback riding, atv tours, and a few more.  Chukka Cove is only 10 minutes or so out of Ocho and if you want activities it is a nice central one.  You can go to Bob Marley\'s home and even meet his mother in Ocho Rios.  For coffee plantations try the Blue Mountain tour.   \r\n \r\nCheck out TripAdvisor.com for info on that area.  There is a ton of stuff there.  You can even type in your resort in the search area and get reviews from people who have stayed there.  Be sure to check out the forums section which is a question and answer area.  Very informative!  Have a great trip!          \nCheck out the website :    They have great suggestions and companies to deal with. \r\n \r\nWhen I was in Jamaica I stayed in Ocho and did a horseback riding tour through a working plantation - interesting and a nice tour.  Ended with tea on the porch of the plantation.  Very nice.          \nHeave-Ho Charters!!!          \nfor diving , try Port Royal. thats were all the pirates used to come in and port. apparently , thats what the tour guide said. Blue Mountain is cool. Went on a bike tour there. Its was funny caus every three seconds some one was saying yeah man. My parents are Jamaican so the ja"fake"can accents were getting to me. Really if you want bit of the culture . Ocho Rios has a huge mix of it. Most of the restaurants there are local and you can get seom excellent food .  \r\nFor wild life , I would say to walkk in the mountains. Its ful of wildlife .  \r\nThe advantage of my family being from there is that Im not a tourist so i get to see all these things. I went back in 2004 for a family reunion and saw  hummingbirds .parotts , rabbits ,lizards just being in the country.  \r\nIf you ever get the chance to go to the country sdie , take it !!          \nduns river falls is fun          \nDunns River is a must! Do not go on the tour with the guide. You can go by yourself and take your time and hang out there. Alot of these things are going to be touristy. We don\'t like the touristy things so we always go the "other way" Where you see all the tourists, go the opposite. Ochi is a lot of fun. There is a local market and a local artist shop. These things are on main street the oher way from Taj Mahal. You will see and know when you get there. Margarittaville is overrun with tourists and REALLY pricey. Go to some of the local bars and support the Jamaicans who live there. Instead of MoBay, go to Negril. Alot more laid back and prettier. Snorkel in Ochi was ok. Negril is great for SCUBA. For the best food, stop at the little stands on the sides of the road. They may not look the greatest but the food is the best!Jerk Chicken is the way to go as is Akee and Saltfish (national dish). For the coffee plantation you\'ll want to go to the Blue Mountains. This will take a day trip. Don\'t be afraid to leave the resort. Go out and mingle and Jamaicans are big on respect. If you are nice, they will be nice! Have fun.          \nLots to see. Do include Montego Bay and Ocho Rios if you can. \r\nGo on line and check things out.  Also if you have the time before you go, call the Jamaica Tourist Board (800 number) and they will be happy to send you some brochures that you can browse through and make some simple inquiries. \r\nTry to stay with a group though, the crime there is bad. \r\nNo matter what you are told, stay with organized tours and groups unless you are the guest of a native and then I am sure they will be most happy to accomodate your sense of adventure. \r\nEnjoy your trip and be safe. \r\nGood Luck.

	{'answer': u'\nIOWA 31 and I\'m 100% Against illegal Immigration.          \nAgainst illegal immigration. \r\n \r\n/For/ increased, well-regulated, legal immigration. \r\n \r\nCalifornia. \r\n \r\n40s          \nNC, 40-something and came here 5 1/2 years ago legally.  I am up for citizenship - just waiting for the interview.  I paid a lot of money to come here.  I do not begrudge that because the American taxpayer should not have to pay for others to immigrate, even legally.  I do begrudge illegals being charged less in some cases than a legal immigrant.  That would have been the case had the recent immigration bill passed. \r\n \r\nIllegal immigration is wrong.  It does not benefit the USA economically.  We should do whatever it takes to deter illegals from coming here on our dime.          \n32 pro reform Illinois          \ni am all for illegal immigrants.... to be arrested and deported!!! \r\n \r\nnevada \r\nage 40          \nI am against the US foreign policies that prey on Mexico and other Latin American countries, which in effect encourages immigration. I also don\'t like some of the policies of the Mexican government that encourages illegal immigration as well.  \r\n \r\nI know some illegals personally and have great respect for them. They are risking their life (and made a journey I\'m not sure I could do) to have opportunity. They work hard and are good people in general.  \r\n \r\nI know that most people who are privileged enough to be born here could not make the trek here and risk their life for the chance to have a very hard, low wage job.  \r\n \r\nI know this country was founded by immigrants and our strength is on our ability to change and be flexible. Liberty is not just a WASP value. I cringe when people insinuate that freedom is not for brown people. I think that that is racist.  \r\nI think there should be a way to integrate immigrants though, and I believe in INS reform.  \r\n \r\nI am from california.          \n220% against illegal immigration(it\'s more like an invasion now), 40\'s Connecticut          \n100% against illegals. \r\n50ish. \r\nFlorida          \n200+million USA citizens an me against the amnesty bill it failed.   Florida  58          \nTexas, early forties. Firmly opposed to illegal immigration.  \r\n \r\nI have helped (and will continue to help) anyone wanting to immigrate.  \r\n \r\nI speak a couple of foreign languages and have lived abroad.  \r\n \r\nI fully agree with my American-Latino friends in "You Don\'t Speak For Me" (Pro-Security, Pro-Justice, Pro-Wall) and encourage their efforts.  \r\n \r\nSimply put, the law must be written to respect those who respect it.  \r\n \r\nPeople are not coming to all of North and South America by the millions; only to the United States. The land is NOT that different.  \r\n \r\nEvery nation on these continents is a European invention yet the illegals never acknowledge it. They want to come to the one nation that thel people globally are trying to enter and using the "it\'s ours, too" argument. What?!! If this patch is yours because Europe invaded, then all those other patches are equally yours, right?  \r\n \r\nSo, why is no one fighting to get into Honduras or Columbia or Nicaragua using the argument that "we didn\'t cross the border, the border crossed us"? And, "We\'re only taking back what the Euro\'s stole?" Funny, a simple DNA test will prove that most Caucasians in the Americas have quite a bit of pre-Columbian blood just as most Latin-Americans have quite a bit of European blood. Do they know where the word "Latin" is from? It\'s from the Latin word meaning "Latin". Which is European.  \r\n \r\nDitto the following: Hispanic, Spanish, Latino, Hombre, Amigo, Columbia... Which of those is NOT European?  \r\n \r\nIf these people ever get truthful about their fight, they\'ll be suicidal.  \r\n \r\n...          \nAgainst - 40\'s - Arizona          \nAgainst illegal immigration;Arizona;past the quarter century mark.          \nI am against illegal immigration... \r\n \r\nI am a citizen that resides in California & I am a 37 year old mom of 4 boys!          \n26 Tennessee I am against Illegal immigration, it\'s not that they do the work we dont want, Its that they do the work for less money, and Real Americans have problems finding work because of them. My advice go home and make your crap hole country better.          \n100% AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND AMNESTY - It\'s wrong \r\n \r\nSouthern California age 50          \nAgainst I live in California and im well my age isnt important          \nagainst  / California / older than most of you          \nGood question. I\'m 20, In college here in WI.  \r\nAnd I am not against illegal immigration, but I\'m kind of not for it. Why, you ask? I think we need to secure our borders, right? We can agree on that. That\'s realistic.  \r\nBut this is where we differ. Ok, we already have 12 million illegal immigrants in the country. We can\'t and won\'t deport all of them. They are deporting but for every you deport, 20 come in (i heard). So I go back and say we really need to secure that border (not close it), but we need to understand that we can\'t do anything but to make the ones already here legal. Legalize them. But they would need to do things for that to  happen, pay a fine, learn English (for those who don\'t know), etc. And give them they chance to become citizens 5-10 years after legalization. Hope you understand my view, it;s what an reasonable person wants. And enforcing the laws (if it ever happens) would only cause chaos. \r\n \r\nedit. . . . .  \r\n \r\nNo, I don\'t live where there are lots of illegal immigrants. But I\'m from Chicago, and there, I have a house that I live in at an area where there seems to be lots of Hispanics. Some might be illegal but I can\'t tell. I don\'t mind them being around.  \r\nWhat people say about illegals is not how I feel. I know people\'s frustration but these illegals are only trying and wanting to work and making money so they can survive.  \r\nAnd even if I lived in a city in a border state where there was a high population of illegals, I still wouldn\'t think differently about them. I live in Chicago, and no, the border is not close, but it\'s almost the same.          \nSouthern California.  It is the pit of illegal immigration.  Everyone should take note of what is happening in California and how destructive it\'s been because this is what many other states have to look forward to if we don\'t get a handle on this problem.  I am so against illegal immigration.  I am of voting, tax paying, child bearing, alcohol buying age.          \nAgaint illegal immigration \r\nThe great state of Texas \r\nbetween 45 and 50          \nsunny CA, against, that\'s my secret!          \nI am very much against illegal immigration (like any sane person is), I live in Utah, and I\'m 17.          \nmy age is 19 (almost 20). I live in NY.  \r\n \r\nI feel that it\'s not fair that we blame illegals for the problems here. And we shouldn\'t be mad at them. We should blame the US and the other countries because they are responsible for their people and if they are being forced to leave their country to enter the US illegally, that is not their fault.          \nI am against illegal immigration, pro legal immigration. Age,( here goes...) 52. Live in Las Vegas,Nevada.          \nI am against illegal immigration totally, Pro legal immigration and I live in South Carolina and 56.          \nI am against illegal immigration, period!  Whether they are illegals that just crossed the border or illegals that have been here for 20 years--THEY ARE STILL ILLEGAL and if they are ILLEGAL, they are CRIMINALS for breaking our laws.  The only resolution is to arrest, deport, stop the benefits, and militarize our border from this senseless invasion.   \r\n \r\nThey came here illegally and decided to raise a family so they can jump into the free chow line?  Come here legally and do it the right way OR deport the whole family.  Sounds too heartless to the bleeding hearts out there?  Not really when you stop to realize that illegals today are getting more free benefits paid by our taxpayers than millions of poor, disabled American citizens that will never get the same benefits from our government!  There are many hard working American middle class and low income working taxpayers (many work 2 jobs) that go to bed hungry, don\'t have proper housing, have no health care, can\'t afford medications for their illnesses and have no hopes of affording a good education, but the illegals do!  That to me is not only heartless, but despicable. \r\n \r\nAmerica needs to STOP handing out incentives (freebies) and allowing employment for these criminals, by doing whatever deems necessary to: \r\nSTOP employers from hiring illegals \r\nSTOP the anchor baby BS \r\nSTOP the subsidized housing \r\nSTOP the welfare and food stamps \r\nSTOP the free healthcare \r\nSTOP the free education \r\n \r\nThis illegal alien invasion is truly a form of "terrorism" that is bound and determined to deteriorate our country\'s infrastructure.  How?  It has resulted in consistently overburdening our schools, hospitals, welfare programs, unemployment programs, social security programs, our security & police forces due to the increase in crime (murders, assaults, drug trafficking, identity theft, drunk driving, uninsured motorists, unlicensed motorists, hit & run accidents), overcrowded our prison facilities, just to name a few. \r\n \r\nArizona.  I\'m old enough to remember the quality of life in America before the illegal invasion; and young enough to fight this form of terrorism right here on America\'s soil!          ',

The kitten's life is in your hands - it doesn't want to hear about wresting practice and school.

	{'answer': u'\nyes it is beautiful.          \nthey make good bread          \nI heard Jamaica is dangerous and dirty, but I never saw it myself.          \nDid you win this trip, thats what I wanna know?? Theyve been giving away trips to this place on a radio station..just curious. But to answer your question I know nothing about this place..i bet its beautiful though          \nA wonderful place with beautiful scenery and very nice people.  The Jamaican currency isn\'t much, so the American dollar is very valuable.  The locals will bargain themselves down to nothing.  They will offer you something for say $60.  If you say no, they will go away.  Then they will come back and drop the price down to $50.  If you go long enough, you can get stuff for very cheap.   \r\n \r\nAlso, on your cruise, sign up to go on the Dunns River Falls excursion.  It is totally awesome!          \nI used to work on a cruise liner that went there. From memory when you get off there is a big open space and then you go accross to a load of cheap crap market stalls. If you go through these and come out the other side you can walk into the town a bit, but be careful because a lot of the locals take advantage of tourists naivity and can be a bit threatening.  \r\n \r\n     It\'s hot and nice though with that typical laid back carribean vibe. If you prefer, go on a guided tour of all the main local attractions. The trouble with a cruise is that you don\'t really get to see or experience anything real because you are not there for long enough.  \r\n \r\n     Well just relax and "every ting gwan be Irie sista"          \nthe place is very beautiful whare bread is made quite well.. \r\n      but the place is very dangerous.....as well as dirty          \nOchos Rios is the second most popular city in Jamaica, first being Montego Bay. Montego bay is the party city for Jamaica and is about 2 hours away from Ochos Rios. Dunn\'s River falls is the biggest touring site in Ochos rios and you can climb the falls with an experienced tour guide. Make sure you bring good waterproof climbing shoes or you will have to rent some for about $10.00 U.S. There are also a few stables in Ochos rios and you can take a horseback ride through the countryside that ends up on the beach! If you are into dolphins, you could try a visit to Dolphin cove, which is also close by. Negril is the city in Jamaica that is know to have the most crime but none of the cities are so bad you wouldn\'t want to visit. Jamaica makes almost all their money from exporting Rum and from tourists, so the people in Jamaica are super friendly and always helpful! Their income depends on it! If anyone asks how you are, just say Irie (eyeree). This is a national word there for everything is awesome! Hope this helps and you have fun in the sun on your Jamaican vacation. If anyone is looking for the best deal on resorts and airlines, we recommend this travel agency we used called Zoom Travel at www.jamaicavacation.com. They beat out prices from travelocity, Orbitz, and even Sam\'s Club Travel Services!          \nIt\'s wonderful.  Since you\'re going on a cruise, you won\'t have too much time for local tourism, but definitely do the Dunn\'s river falls tour.  It\'s great. Where else can you walk up a waterfall? if you have a full day, the Marley Bus Tour is fun too!          \nit is nice. I am planning on going back.   \r\n \r\nHaggle with them, I got stuff for like 1/3 of what they were asking. We honed our skills at the beach sale at our resort. They had local vendors come in and set up on the beach.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nparasailing, there is wonderful scuba diving in cozumel when your in cozumel go to carlos n charlies. :)          \nI have been to the caymans several times ...since it will be a cruise and you will be there one day I recommend visit Stingray city (trust me ---I have swam with these 4 times, ppl bring kids out there, and they have been tamed completely or are lame(no barb injured) So despite Steve Iwrins accident (one in a million) \r\n \r\nI would go you can request a copy of the video they shoot of everyone playing in the water  In the caymans there is nothing better to do check it out online (cayman island website)          \nCozumel-Shopped for silver jewelry, real bargins \r\n \r\nCaymans-Went to a turtle farm and after that a lunch while laying on the beach \r\n \r\nOcho Rios-Rode mopeds/swam \r\n \r\nCaribbean to me has the prettiest water around          \nSwimming with the sting rays is really fun in the Caymens. They do try to get you to kiss them (yuck) and feed them nasty little fish \r\nMy then-6 year old was afraid though so if you have kids, keep in mind that that might happen. \r\nWe went on this submarine in Cozumel that was really cool, but I forgot what it\'s called :-X          \nWe went on the submarine reef tour in Grand Cayman - it was breathtaking!  Try the town tours and get to know the cities.          \nIn Ocho Rios you have to climb the Dunn River Falls. That was great.  In Cozumel - swim with the dolphins or just rent scooters and cruise on the island yourself. careful not give boarding passes or credit cards.          \nWe\'re going to those same exact locations in less than three weeks. \r\n \r\nGrand Cayman - Pirate ship cruise, drinks and beach time. \r\nCozumel - Trimaran to snorkeling, then to a beach. \r\nJamaica - Local tour of some sights, then a climb up Dunns river falls. \r\n \r\nWe\'re also stopping at a place in Haiti for some pure beach time. \r\n \r\nCan\'t wait! \r\n \r\nGood luck!          \nHave been to all these ports several times.  You don\'t mention what kinds of things you like to do, so it\'s hard to give specific answers that would apply to you.  However.... \r\n \r\nIn Cayman, as others have said, you should go to Stingray City.  It\'s not a "city" at all, or even a developed area.  It\'s a shallow sand bar out in the bay [water will be knee deep to shoulder deep] where the stingrays gather because they get fed by the tourists.  It is a terrific experience, even if you\'re a "scardey-cat" like me.  You can arrange for this trip on your own - there are several reliable people who do this trip [Captain Marvin and Nativeway are ones I\'ve used] or if you might have a tight time frame, you can do it through the ship.  The ship\'s tours will be VERY crowded, however. \r\n \r\nIn Cozumel, Chankanaab Park is beautiful.  [They have a website - check it out.]  You can snorkel, lie on the beach, take a nice walk past "ruins", etc, etc.  This is very easy to do on your own.  Just get a cab outside the port and go.  When you want to return there will be plenty of cabs waiting.  Just don\'t cut it too close on the time getting back to the ship.  Many people like to shop in Coz, which again is easy to do on your own.  If you want a less "touristy" experience, go in a block or two from the main drag.  Most places will "bargain". \r\n \r\nIn Jamaica, I would not try to do a tour on my own.  Everyone says that Dunn\'s River Falls is a must-do.  It is pretty, but it\'s also very crowded and unless you like to get wet while climbing up the slippery falls, this may not be your cup of tea.  There is a boardwalk you can use to see the falls without having to climb.  You might want to consider doing a "party boat" or some such that goes to the falls and back.  If you do go to DRF, you can avoid the annoying vendors at the exit by going back to the entrance and exiting there.  One thing we did that we really enjoyed was tubing on the White River [not to be confused w/rafting on the Martha Brae].  It was a lot of fun and very easy.  If you don\'t want to go on any excursions, you could walk over to Island Village, a limited-access [no locals] recreation of a Caribbean village shopping area.  There is a Margaritaville there, and if you buy a drink [soft or hard] you get a wristband that allows you to use the facilities.  It\'s literally a five-minute walk from the ship - you will still be harassed by locals to buy various things [legal and not] and/or get your hair braided; just politely say "no" and keep walking.  Some people like to shop in Jamaica and there is a shopping area in Ocho, but it will be a gauntlet of vendors.   \r\n \r\nFor more info on things to do at these ports, go to CruiseCritic.com, click on "Boards" and then "Ports of Call". \r\n \r\nHave a great trip!!          \nsince u have a few months...def. check out cruisecritic.com....I\'m goin on a cruise in less than 3 weeks and have used that web side as my cruise bible!!!

	{'answer': u"\nIs this a Celebrity cruise on the Century ship? I went on the same one like 5 years ago! It was great!!!! In ocho Rios i went to a waterfall and climbed it and I snorkeled. In the cayman islands i went swimming with sting rays!!!!! SO MUCH FUN! and in cozumel we went to the mayan ruins and also went to a beach! hope that helps and hope you have fun!          \nIf there's a Zip-line excursion do it. My wife and I did it in Hawaii and loved it.          \nDo the Dunn's River Falls in Ochos.  It is fun.   \r\nThere is a great 7 mile beach in Cozumel that is really fun.  They will have the banana boat rides that you can go on there.  Cayman Islands are great for snorkeling.          \nThere are a ton of things to do in Cozumel.  I recommend the Cavern by Jeep tour.  You take the ferry to Playa del Carmen and you get to drive a jeep to a cavern with an underground river.  You can swim in the underground river which is a unique expereince because they won't even let you touch the water in underground caverns in the US!  Then back to the jeeps to drive to a private beach with an authentic Mexican lunch. \r\n \r\nThe submarine ride in Cozumel is fun but avoid if closed in spaces bother you. \r\n \r\nThe dolphin experience was fun but expensive. \r\n \r\nCozumel is fun to shop...but avoid the mall.  Hit the open air markets for the best deals.  Bartering is part of the experience. \r\n \r\nYou should definately take one of the stingray adventures in Grand Caymans but skip the one that includes the trip to the Turtle Farm and Hell.  Those side trips take up too much time and are not worth it.  The locals in Grand Caymans are not as friendly as in Cozumel and they will not barter with you in the markets.  You have to tender (take the ferry) from your ship to the dock in Grand Cayman.  Allow plenty of time for this. \r\n \r\nNo recommendation on Ocho Rios...we were in Montego Bay.          \nThe most popular: \r\nOcho Rios, Dunn's River Falls \r\nCozumel, Swimming with Dolphins (alternate/cheaper: swim with sea lions) \r\nGrand Cayman, Stingray City. \r\n \r\nLots of other things to do, but these three are must do's!          \nDunn's River Falls in Ocho Rios was really fun, and beautiful, The best thing in the Caymen Islands is to snorkel or just swim at the beach it is also very beautiful there, when your in Jamaica if people follow you around trying to sell you stuff just keep walking and ignore them you will be fine.          \nI went on this same cruise on Royal Carribean Rhapsody of the Seas. In Ocho Rios, climb Dunn's River Falls. It's awesome. In Grand Cayman, go on the submarine. And in Cozumel, swim with the dolphins. BUT DON'T BOOK THROUGH THE CRUISE LINE!!! You don't need any prior reservations to climb the waterfall, and in the other places go on the internet and Google them. Book it through the company itself, and it will be a thousand times cheaper. Have fun on your trip! Hope this helps!          \nOK, it really depends on what you like to do.  My wife & I really enjoy snorkeling, my (adult) sons, do too, but they like some of the go-fast activities better.  That said, here goes: \r\n \r\nGrand Cayman \u2013 have done the Reef & Wreck Snorkel once, and the Stingray City Snorkel tour once, and enjoyed both.  The wreck is about 80 years old, in water shallow enough to see clearly, and it has coral growth begun on it.  Kinda cool.  And the reef portion of the tour is quite nice, too - good numbers and varieties of fish and plentiful coral and plantlife.  If you want to see the stingrays up close, the other tour is the way to go.  They swim all around you and brush up against you.  No injuries, according to the guides.  Potentially, you could do both of these, since they each offer a morning tour and a noon-time departure.  Similar cost, I recall \u2013 in the $50 per person range. \r\n \r\nCozumel \u2013 wife & I did the Palancar Reef Snorkel tour once, and the 3-Site Snorkel & Scuba Tour.  Palancar was good, but deeper than the tours in Grand Cayman, ranging from 15 to 35 feet deep, and you just drift with the current, so it\u2019s not strenuous at all.  The snorkel/scuba combined tour wasn\u2019t so good \u2013 the snorkelers enjoyed some drop-off points, the scuba\u2019ers enjoyed others, so the whole thing felt like a compromise.  Sons did beginning scuba (from the shore) and enjoyed it.  Also, they have just walked ashore and rented a scooter and tooled around town \u2013 but beware the police shakedown potential, being stopped for no real reason other than to get a few bucks off you. \r\n \r\nJamaica \u2013 Dunns River Falls is pretty, but can be a strenuous walk in wet shoes up a slippery path.  We enjoyed the Jungle River Rafting \u2013 very serene, through a lot of bamboo and palm forest in a very shallow river \u2013 16 tubes lashed together, led by a guide.  The boys did the jungle zip line and really liked it a lot.  We also did a semi-sub there, and didn\u2019t like that experience \u2013 the walls of the boat below the waterline have windows, and the thick glass was scratched/fogged enough that the sights were kinda hazy.  Pictures came out horrible, but maybe that was just our bad luck with that one boat \u2013 so buyer beware. \r\n \r\nShopping is available at any of these ports, and the ship will have announcements or classes on where to go and what to avoid. \r\n \r\nGood luck and Have fun!!!

	{'answer': u"\nBook a double room online, many online agencies offer free cancellation. Then ring up the hotel, pretend to be someone else and find out. Then cancel the room. Life is that simple!          \nI don't think they can tell your parents that info. most won't even confirm guests names for privacy. just book two room's you can alternate nights in the two rooms. try telling your parent's it would be easier to get two room's if one was paid for. if they are so concerned maybe they'll even pay for one of the room's.          \nYou're both adults, it's really none of your parents' business .... but I don't think any hotel will give out such information to people phoning.          \nAre your parents from the middle ages?          \nOh just have a good romp on a park bench after all that's all you're going for is it not ;)          ",

The money used for the trip will be from our own savings. \n \nThe thing I'm anxious about is if my mother rang the hotel and asked if there's any bookings under our names, and if so, if it's a double room or two single rooms. Can hotel staff do this? \n \nWe thought of aliases however we then discovered that most hotels will ask for ID. \n \nThanks!  ",

	{'answer': u'\nYou need to measure the diameter of the stem of the caster (the shaft that is inserted into the chair), and the diameter of the caster wheel.          \nPop off one of the casters and go shopping, like in a really good big hardware store. You may well not find an exact "match", but could find one that will do the job - and then replace all of them, so it sits level and rolls well. A good office supply store, one that sells lots of office furniture, would also be a potential resource.          \nRefer to your manual on your chair or call the store that you bought it from.

And the bottom of the chair nor anywhere else has a brand name.  Looking online (for example:  it seems that there are no pre-requisites when it comes to casters and that one size fits all.  Is this a correct assumption?  Or do I have to buy the same casters that came with my chair?  ',

	{'answer': u'\nRoll back what progress?          \nthe part in question is illegal immigration, it were legal there would be no issue, to try to paint it as a shade of grey is the problem, it is illegal.          \nFor some reason it pisses me off when minorities talk about all the \'progress we\'ve made when it comes to race.\'          \ndo you mean like a little illegal...          \nMiddle ground?  What ******* part of "illegal" don\'t you understand.  Murder is illegal.  Is there a middle ground when dealing with murder?          \nIf that \'middle ground\' consists of having them stay here I\'m not listening. That isn\'t middle ground. That\'s giving them what they want (WANT, not NEED) at a time when we need to be concentrating on the needs of citizens and legal immigrants.          \nSo what you are after is a Semi-legal or maybe semi-illegal? I don\'t understand. If the law is broken then it is illegal. If the law is obeyed then it is legal. So how do you get to this middle place you speak of?          \nSeems like the biggest wacko here is you.          \nJust how do Republicans want to "roll back all the progress of race and immigration relations in America?"  Im curious to hear your explanation and citations for that one. \r\n \r\nAs for immigration.  Republicans have no problem with legal immigrants.  My wife is a legal immigrant.  Its illegal immigrants that are part of the reason for the  backlog and increasing fees in the legal immigration system.   Republicans I know want to fix legal immigration, not roll it back. \r\n \r\nRepublicans want to do 3 things in general: \r\n1) Fix the border and stop more from coming. \r\n2) Fix legal immigrations and help those in the system first. \r\n3) Path to citizenship or deportation of those here illegally (basically the person\'s choice as long as they are not guilty of other crimes). \r\n \r\n+++++++++++ \r\nAgain please show a source that Republicans are trying to stop all immigration and particulary Asians from coming to the USA... again my wife is a legal imigrant and an Asian.          \nIt\'s- "to an educated son of Indian.. blah, blah, blah." Get a better education.          \nUm, no. Republicans, pretty much all Republicans, support managed legal immigration. As to your comment about stopping it, no one wants to stop it. You need to remember that ALL nations, even India, have immigration quotas to protect their own people. Turn it around. Can you imagine how difficult it would be for me, a technical professional, to immigrate to India and possibly take a job from an Indian worker? Do you think I\'d get much resistance from the Indian government? Bet your bippy I would!  \r\n \r\nAs to the Democrats, you\'re right. They\'re all for open borders and government borrowing billions from China to provide social services.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    To a educated son of Indian legal immigrants, I feel that both parties are taking a stance antagonistic to legal immigrants. The wacko wing of the Democratic Party wants to open the borders, and the Republicans want to roll back all the progress of race and immigrant relations in America. BTW I am socially liberal in all aspects except for illegal immigration, which I consider a fiscal and national issue.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nWell ive been to cozumel several times and my best advice is that you should rent a jeep for your time in cozumel. Drive atround the island and see everything its a beautiful island and the people are friendly....but yes if your going to book an excursion, make sure you do it throug the ship because they do not gaurentee the ship will wait if you are late getting back from some private tour.....but in cozumel the island is not very big and so you have PLENTY of time to drive around the whole thing, stop at the beaches and play in the surf..the other side of the island is sooo great, a lot less people and beaches to yourself..jave fun          \nDepends on how much research you\'re willing to do ahead of time, how comfortable you are in being on your own, how good you are at watching the time and allowing for possible problems, whether you\'ve been to any of the ports before, how many ships are in port, etc., etc.  Some ports are easier/safer to go it alone than others. \r\n \r\nOn your itinerary, Coz and GC are very easy/safe to do on your own; Ocho is not; Labadee is a private island so the point is moot.  GC is a tendered port and tends to have several ships in port at the same time.  Thus it can be hard to get around quickly.  Port time sometimes differs from ship\'s time, too.  Coz also tends to get a lot of ships at once, but there are three piers, so the arriving/departing crowds are spread out somewhat.  Ocho will be a test of your ability to put up with being harassed every step of the way, if you go it alone. \r\n \r\nYour library has books on "Caribbean Ports of Call" or you can go to CruiseCritic.com, click on "Boards", then go to "Ports of Call" for up-to-date great advice from experienced cruisers.

	{'answer': u'\nFirst cruise....you have so many to pick, you\'ll need to do a little research and homework.  Fortunately, there a great websites, youtube videos, and books/resources to help you decide. \r\n \r\nFor our first cruise, we went to the Mediterranean on the Disney Magic. They spoiled us but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and were glad Disney took care of us from the moment we landed to the ship to shore excursions, Dinner, Shows, activities, etc.  Disney was great and the weather was perfect. \r\n \r\nWe then went with Princess for our second cruise to the Baltics.  Again, we were impressed with the Crown Princess.   \r\n \r\nNow is a great time to book cruises with the recession driving alot of cruise lines to cut their fares for all cabins.  Some offer great discounts for 2009 and 2010 cruises. \r\n \r\nwww.cruisecritic.com is a great web site that tells you info on each cruise line and cruise ship, both good and not so good.  But all the information is important so that you know what to expect and prepare for so you are not surprised. \r\n \r\nGood Luck and have fun!          \nHonestly speaking, I\'ve been on three different cruise lines. Disney, Carnival and Norweigan.  \r\n \r\nDisney was by far better than the others, but it\'s more kid and family orientated.  No matter who you are you\'ll have a good time, but if you don\'t have kids, don\'t waste the money. \r\n \r\nDon\'t bother with Carnival. At all. They\'re horrible.  It\'s a floating casino.  They\'re unorganized, the staff isn\'t friendly or helpful at all, the food and entertainment suck, and the rooms are just an "eh" rating. \r\n \r\nNCL would be my pick.  The ships are beautiful, the staff is so friendly, there is NO DINNER TIME! Which is nice, because if you don\'t feel like going to dinner until 8, you can. If you want to go at 5, you can. And you don\'t have to get all dressed up! THere are more options for everything, the rooms are awesome no matter what kind of room you have.  NCL is always ahead of schedule, and as soon as you step onto the pier they\'re at every point along the way to welcome you and help you with anything you need.  They give you free drinks when you get onboard and they have lunch waiting for you when you board the first day. The shows get better and better every night, the food is fabulous, theres something to do for everyone, always. \r\n \r\nCheck out their website (its down below in the sources) and just search for a cruise in the time frame you want.  You can call their number and talk to a cruise consultant and they\'re there to help you, not get your money. They\'re all very nice.          \nIf you\'re planning to go in September, that really doesn\'t give you much time to do all the research necessary before you can book.  There are so many variables - no one cruise would be suitable for everyone.  It is also very late for making a reservation for September, although, since kids will be back in school and it is still hurricane season, you should be able to find something. \r\n \r\nYour ages will limit which cruise lines you can choose from.  You will then need to decide itinerary, type of cabin, length of cruise, which ship in which line, etc, etc.  Your library or bookstore has books that outline the basics of cruising, and they also have books on Caribbean ports of call.  Once you\'ve done some reading, go to an experienced travel agent, who can help you book your cruise.          \nHi I had never cruised before and we took a Carnival Cruise out of Miami around the Carribean, had a great time and I am now on my 5th cruise in January, one answer says Carnival is no good but they are classed as fun ships and I would think that if you are under 50 (and I think you are) you should have a great time, (we are in our 50\'s) \r\nYou should get a good deal booking late.take a look at   and   \r\nyou can read reviews of other cruisers on the latter site even on a particular ship          \ndefinitely a caribbean cruise on royal caribbean international. \r\nbest service. best ships. loads of activities and fun!! \r\nplus the caribbean is so beautiful. you ll have a great time! \r\n \r\ngood luck and have fun!          \nWhen my bf and I took our first cruise, we went on the Carnival Legend. \r\nIt leaves from Tampa and our itinerary was Belize, Cozumel, Honduras, and Grand Cayman. \r\nIt was a 7 night cruise. \r\nWE HAD THE MOST AMAZING TIME OF OUR LIFE!!! \r\nSorry for the caps, but I had to say it loud and proud! \r\nAs for the negative comments about Carnival, please don\'t let that steer you away from them. \r\nFrom personal experience, they are far from a "floating casino" and the food, service, entertainment, etc were outstanding! \r\nWe are both 24 and not huge partiers, but we had literally the "time of our life" as the commercials say. \r\nI dont know what port you are leaving from, but honestly, as a first cruise, I think you should look into this one. \r\nBon Voyage! \r\nAny questions, email me!          \nPick one that you can drive to if possible. That way you save on air fare at least. Take a Carnival cruise, they are fun and less expensive then most others. Doesnt really matter where you go, just go!!!          \nBeen on several cruises and love the Caribbean.  Royal Caribbean had more class than most but I hear Carnival is the most fun. You will be treated like a king and queen on any of them.          \nAll of the Caribbean and the Bahamas are beautiful, so you can\'t go wrong there.  Since it is your first time, I would recommend Carnival, Royal Caribbean and NCL in that order.  You will receive great service on any of these lines, but because you are in your twenties, Carnival might be a better pick because there is always something to do. Check with the line about insurance since it is hurricane season!          ',

	{'answer': u"\nHow does it sound to you? I have never watched X-Factor, so I ask you, how does it compare to what you have heard on X-Factor? \nI only listened to a little bit of your singing. Maybe it was the choice of material, but I didn't think it was great. You weren't awful, but I'd say you could improve.          \nNo          \nI think you have a very good and unique voice, but i think you should choose another song that fits your voice. I do love this song though!          \nX-Factor? Yes \nRecord deal? No          \nSorry, but no. \nYou have a nice little voice, but you often went flat, your breath control isn't too good and you're very nasal. \n \nThere are thousands of girls with better voices out there - it would have to be much stronger and much more interesting to get you anywhere.          \nHmmm... \n \nWhen you got started, it sounded as you lost a few years and ended up being younger than you looked. As a singer of being 10 years old. \n \nTo say as well, unless the style was meant to sound this way... the tongue held back in expressing the whole song. It seemed to have grown and taken over the voice.  \n \nAll but a typical rendition, from most teeny boppers around. \n \nLollipop.          \nSorry but its not a good choice considering that Adam Lambert sang that song and will be pretty hard to beat him.

	{'answer': u"\nIf you hate him.. leave right now.  Don't even think about it another moment.  Love is never hate.          \ngo ahead and leave he seems to have some anger problems          \ndoes he take steroids          \nYou should leave...          \nThat is somewhat scary.  Sounds like he has rage issues.  You need to have him get to the bottom of these issues so that he can learn to control his temper.  The scariest thing is--what does he do to you when he gets mad at you?  Not a good thought.          \nleave him but find a good psychiatrist for him          \ndo you see yourself ever being able to be happy with him acting like that? that is not anywhere near normal. that is abusive and it may only get worse.          \nleave him for your own safety          \nOH U SHOULD HAV BEEN LEFT WEN IT GOT OUT OF CONTROL          \nhe could be stressed from work or other things........kinda sounds like how my dad was and he got so bad my mom had to kick him out of the house....          \nIt sounds like your husband has some real anger issues. I would say talk to him about it first and then if change doesn't take place, leave. It also sounds like his anger can lead to abuse.          \nif you really want to leave then just do it, there is no point in staying with someone that you no longer want to be with \r\ngood luck          \nI'll address the only question in your post.... \r\n \r\nIs this normal? - No \r\nCan You leave him? - Yes if you feel that is the best thing to do. \r\n \r\nEveything else in your post is a statement - if your looking for someone to tell you its OK, well your the only one that can make that decision for yourself.... \r\n \r\nBest of luck, sounds like its a matter of time before he starts hitting YOU.          \nWell, after hearing that, I can't say I blame you for wanting to leave.  The sooner the better, as this violence is only going to escalate, and he's probably not the kind of guy you can have a meaningful discussion with, and solve some problems. \r\n    If you have family that you can count on, try to arrange some temporary accomodations with them until you get your own place....Count on him being angry, blaming you etc. etc. and he'll probably pull the sad/crying act when the blame game doesn't work.   \r\n       Eventually, you will hopefully find a guy who's a little more mature, and treats you the way you deserve to be treated. Don't settle for anything less...life is too short to be miserable. \r\n       Take the first step before it's too late...Good luck!  Dr. Harvey Glimebinder          \ndon't leave him. can you remember why you married him? he is obviously depressed and frustrated, don't leave him in his vunerable position..although it may seem more hostile than vunerable. marriages are meant to endure these hardships. try to speak to him when he is not in one of his moods, but calmly. Suggest going to counseling together. You are probably extremley fed up with him...but do you really hate him?? He is probably causing you a lot of emotional pain, but he seems to be struggling with himself. I'm not telling you to tolerate it, take action, but don't let this action be leaving him. Find some common ground to work with, counseling may save your marriage. There are many more options just than leaving him, marriage was meant to endure these terrible and frustrating times. I hope you do what is best and repatch your marriage.          \nI too have the same problem with mine. It has been going on for 20+ years now. I am very laid back and easy going and he is extremely aggressive and controlling. He has been jealous of me from day one even though I have never given him a reason to be! I know about not being able to laugh off the tiniest things. Doesn't happen. I walk on eggshells most of the time as not to upset him and send him into one of his tirades! I have had enough of it and I know now that it is time for me to go my own way. I have decided that I am special and I deserve a life that will bring me happiness each and every day. I just want to wake each morning and feel like the world is mine and not what he thinks it should be for me! I know I didn't give you much advice but I felt compelled to respond in support of your feelings and frustrations! If nothing else, realize that you are not alone! Wishing you luck with whatever your decision will be....          \nYou can try setting some boundaries for his behavior. Let him know that if he continues this behavior there will be consequences. i.e. he is losing your respect for him and let him know that you are going to leave the room or the house if possible when he behaves in such a manner. Go to a movie or get something to eat without him. If this does not have any effect let him know that if he does not get counseling and stick with it that you may need to separate. Don't keep silent. I had a similiar situation and afterward realized that I had not been honest about how I felt. I did not give him a chance to realize the extent of his behavior and possibly make changes.          \nHe  sounds like a time bomb.  Leave and don't look back.          \nHas he always been like this?  If he has just started to act up this way, there must be an underlying problem that needs checking out.  If this is the case, I am totally in agreement that you should not leave him but take your marriage vows seriously and work it out together.  i.e. visit doctor, counselling, anger management etc.          \nThings to think about: Have you ever mentioned to him that your thinking of leaving him because of the way he acts? I understand why if you haven't.. But sometimes when people realize they are going to lose someone they love and care about they take a good look at themselves.. he may not even know its affecting you-although he should!  And has he always been this way since you have been married or is this a new development? If he has always been this way and you strongly believe he cannot change then I would say you need to do what makes you happy! But.. if he has not always been this way maybe there is an underlying issue as to why he gets angry easily!  You mentioned he is depressed.. things like that can be worked through.. (if you want to stick with the marriage.)          \nIf you've done everything, then leave. Has he gone to a 'control your temper' meeting (not sure of the correct terminology). He needs to get his rage under control. Did you seek counselling? If you truly have done everything, and you are so unbelievably miserable, and you actually HATE him, then what is the point of you being miserable for the rest of your life? I think it's time for you to have something better. After all, you deserve to be happy too. Good luck to you!          ",
	 'question': u"\n    My husband gets angry over the tiniest things. For example, when he spilled some soup on himself, he stood up, threw the plate into the sink( it broke), threw the fork towards me( it almost hit me in the eye), and made angry noise like a lion. Then he didn't say a word for the rest of the night. \r\nToday when I came home, the office was a mess. All my clothes were on the ground, there were paper and books on the ground, the leather office chair was laying down, missing one of its rolling casters. My husband wasn't home. What I guess had happened was that when he was sitting on the chair, one of the rolling casters broke, he might had felt somehow, then he got mad and thre everything on the ground. \r\nI hate him--the angry look that's on his face everyday;  the fact that he can't control his temper and can't not laugh over these things; the fact that he is so immature and stuipd; for throwing stuff on the ground but never organize it...

	{'answer': u"\nYes Ocho Rios is a recognised tourist area (where you are reasonably safe) as opposed to a non-tourist area where anything might happen.  The only problem with Jamaica is the higglers (street traders)  who can be very persistent.  Many folk living in Kingston dream of one day being able to move to a place like Ocho Rios - much quieter and the city and very beautiful.  The nearest city to Ocho Rios is Montego Bay which can be a bit scary even for someone like me who has been to Jamaica several times (to visit family).          \nOcho Rios is not scary at all. If you're going to be scared of Ocho Rios then you'd be afraid of your own shadow. It's a lovely town (one of my favourite here) and there's plenty to do. The resorts are beautiful. Come and have fun :-)          \nOn trip advisor it is getting mixed reviews. Go here to read the reviews and see some photos \r\n \r\nclick on Caribbean than Jamaica search on hotel name \r\n \r\nGood luck \r\ns          \nOcho Rios is a very toursity area of Jamaica mixed with the locals.  It is not a city and the people as most Jamaicans are very friendly.  \r\n \r\nDepending on the type of vacation you are looking for if beach and sun is what you want then consider Negril.  \r\n \r\nOcho Rios has the famous Dunns river Falls and  \r\n \r\nThere is Port Antonio where you can enjoy the country without the toursim \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nCheck out this price \r\n          \nI am getting married there in August..I heard great things about Jamica!  \r\nGood luck finding out what you need!! Also have fun if you end up going!! \r\n:)          \nYes it is a nice place to visit and u will be safe.          \n8 Rivers is very nice - safe as any major city in the US. If you stay there, be sure to check out Dunn's River Falls, major tourist attraction. Even better is the blue hole - local swimming hole, absolutely beautiful. However, the absolute best place to visit in Jama is Negril by far. Best beaches, the best people, the best restraunts and 100% completely safe. Of course you may be pestered to buy crap from the local merchants like anywhere else, the whole attitude in Negril is different from the rest of the country, very laid back, hippy like. Go to NEGRIL!! you won't regret it.          \nI stayed there by myself for a month so forget about the scary part... its not (common sense applies of course... you are still in Jamaica) \r\nIf its a nice place to spend a vacation that depends entirely on what you are looking for. FP has a nice beach pretty close by (even if its pretty on the beach... the gate to enter it is like a block away) and its right in front of the cruise liner terminal so there is quite a lot of people and stuff to do during the day including shopping and restaurants and a lot of excursions like Dunn rivers or fern gully, there is a place where you can go and swim with dolphins and sharks another to go horse riding.. lot to do \r\nWhat i don't like much of that side its the night life.... the only place you will go to is margaritaville that is open only 3 nights per week... there are a couple of other clubs but its not places where tourist go (and don't know if you like dancehall anyway) \r\nIf you are a day person that loves the beach and nature... you'll have a great week if you are looking for nightlife then you are better off in Negril          \nOcho Rios is a lovely place.It is a great tourist resort.Lots of night life and beautiful hotels.I love Ocho Rios.You will enjoy it.          \nno dont worry. och rios is beautiful.dont just look at pictures but experience it for yourself. the hotels are wonderful with every thing you need, yes everything. the people are extemely friendly and the beaches are wonderful. \r\ni have been their several times.

	{'answer': u"\nBecause other than xenophobia from bigots, illegal immigrants haven't posed a big threat to the country.          \nBecause they only took government jobs for the bennies.          \nBecause illegal immigration doesn't contribute (rather detract) from the tax pool, so they mess up social security, but take up employment without receiving tax returns at the end of the year, and don't require minimum wage. This is great for companies, but bad for middle class Americans.          \nThere is no such thing as illegal immigration. White Americans are the minority. Soon you will be hunted down and tourted like the dogs you are. America will be defeated and Islam will conquer!          \nGreat point!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!          \nbecause we have more important things to worry about - like the financial crisis.          \nIt is like anything else make the rule but then do not inforce it.          \nactually they haven't been ignoring it. \r\n \r\n \r\nhaven't you seen the news lately?          \nBecause immigrants do the country good, both legal and illegal.  Most parties know this but around election time saying the opposite is a vote-winner.          \nIt would be very politically damaging for either party to enforce the law. All our politicians care about is getting re elected.          \nMostly because the right course of action is exactly the opposite of what the vocal opposition has managed to shape in the minds of most people. \r\n \r\nfor 25 years this nation failed to secure the border, failed to let enough workers in legally, and failed to enforce the law when businesses hired these workers.    Why?  Because it was good for business.  That is inexcusable, but creating and enforcing a policy that is bad for business is just as stupid.   \r\n \r\nThe reality is that this country needs immigrant workers to sustain the economy.  Not so much now with a serious recession, but the economy will improve and we will be right back at it.   \r\n \r\nWe should have the immigration we need and it should be legal.  To that end we must recognize that the last 25 years was mostly having the immigration we needed, but not legal and above board.   Setting that right is not just about deporting all the workers.  Every intelligent person knows that, but is forced to provide lip service to the xenophobes framing the debate.          \nUnless you're an Indian you're here illegally too!          \npart of the problem is that certain segments of the economy benefit from the hiring of illegals, so politicians have a conflict-letter of the law in public pronouncements but practical benefit (and god only knows what else influences them) in private. \r\n \r\nIllegal immigrants are here because they can get hired and make money, very decent money from the standards of where they come from.  As long as they can find work, they will keep coming. \r\n \r\nSomebody, a very lot of somebodies, must be hiring these people.  And there is the heart of the problem.          \nWith a promise to the states to address the problem, the Congress granted amnesty in the 80's. There is a 2 fold reason for both parties have not addressed the issue.  \r\nThe Republicans will not address it and avoid deportation because the Democrats will attempt to capitalize on it and vie for the Hispanic community votes.  \r\nThe Democrats want the illegals to enter, the more the better so when they grant amnesty their voter base in the Hispanic community will be even larger.  \r\nThe dirty little secret is that all Congress and the president has to do is leave law enforcement alone to do their jobs. Just enforce the laws we already have, we don't need more. Deport them and re enforce the borders. Stop playing politics on our dime.          ",

	{'answer': u"\nWow, that is a lot of questions. If you want to be in an orchestra, you can start right now by auditioning for a local youth or community orchestra. If you are wanting to play professionally in an orchestra, you also need to start building your musical resume by competing in contests and performing every chance you get. The fact that you have already won awards is good. You are going to use that to get yourself into a music program at a university with a good reputation. Major in music performance with the tuba as your primary instrument. You will make connections there that will help you get into an orchestra when the time comes. As for the audition process and what you need to play, that all depends on the organization.          \nI disagree that you have to go to a special music school to get an audition for professional work in an orchestra.  I would say find the very best tuba or low brass teacher and really work with him (or her) for as long as you can. \n \nI went to several universities, then summer schools, Brevard, Aspen, Chatauqua.  At Aspen I worked under Phil Farkas, (formerly Chicago Symphony) and he chose me to play with the professional group at Aspen.  Then I followed him to U of Indianna--no fancy special music school.   \n \nFrom there I found that North Carolina Symphony, a touring orchestra was holding an audition.  I took a bus from there to North Carolina without even knowing if I would win the audition. \n \nFrom NC Sym, I met the first horn from Quebec City Symphony, got an audition with him and won 4th horn.  From Quebec City I auditioned with 16 other horn players in Montreal and won 4th horn there. \n \nI say your teacher is more important that degrees from special music school.  They never asked me which school I went to.  They did ask me my teacher's name. \n \nPractice 3 hours a day, every day, go to IMSLP on google and get music you need free.  Practice hard and don't let anything stop you. \n \nNancy          ",
	 'question': u"\n    ok so i am 16 years old and i play the tuba, i have played the tuba for almost two years now, and i just love the instrument, I've only been doing music for two years I'm not those types of people that start playing music since the moment they where born, no I just basically started music. so my question is how does one get into an orchestra? by that i mean how do u apply for a job in a orchestra, how good do u have to be, what level of theory do u need to have, if u have to audition how long does the audition take? what do u have to play in a audition? i know im not skilled enough to play in an orchestra and that i'll probably have to wait a long time to actually apply for a job in an orchestra, but u know im just curious. i play in my school band and despite being the player with the least experience i am the most advanced player in the whole band, i have won countless of awards for band and now its just getting boring there is no other challenge in the band , what im trying to say is I've grown out of the band I'm not saying that I'm the best tuba player out there I'm ok. so what ells could i do apart from band? is there something i could do before i actually join an orchestra? there r no tuba teachers in my area so i cant get actual tuba classes, also is it easier to get a job as a tuba than any other instrument because my music teacher tell's me that there r so few people that play the tuba that it's easier to get a job as tuba player than for example a violin player.

	{'answer': u"\nThese links may help:  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI hope you and your daughter enjoy your time in Rome :) Wish you all the best!          \nA couple of places that I particularly like that are walking distance to the sights are the Accademia and the Ces\xe0ri . The Accademia is right around the corner from Trevi Fountain.  The Ces\xe0ri is close to the Pantheon on the route between the Pantheon and Trevi Fountain.  \r\n \r\nAnother possibility is the romano right across from the Forum.           \nEmpire Palace Hotel\u2014See Slideshow Photos  \r\n \r\nTake a walk in the Borghese garden, sipping the finest French wines while people are watching on the Via Veneto, browsing the historic of Via Margutta or taking pleasure from the exhibition of the Spanish steps. It was grand house owned by a dignified Venetian Family. \r\n \r\nBuilt around a patio; the conversion is stylish, not to utter luxurious, contrast of traditional and modern. The design is brought about on 3 themes; Modern art, Venice, and the luminary of the night . \r\n \r\nThe instituted American bar has the revolutionary  of room and design  while guest rooms placid in the radiant patina of cerise wood and colours of gold, welcomes you to the restaurant  that serves garment seasonal Mediterranean cuisine and pleasant wine in  a sensation of classic stylishness \u2014it is a restaurant named  Aurelaino after the fall of the Roman Emperor. \r\n \r\n45 minutes from Fiumicino  Airport \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHave a nice treat! \r\nThanks          \nIn junho/2010 i stay in this hotel  it is very close from metro, so its easy go to the attractions to walk.          \nDon't worry about speaking Italian there are so many tourist there and most if not all menus have english below the italian.So many people will speak Italian, spanish and english. The subway (metropolitan) has stops near spanish steps, Trevi fountain, vatican city. For 16 euros you can buy a metropolitan pass good for 7 days. If you decide to take the train from fiumicino to termini and then get on the metropolitan from the time you get off the train which is the farthest platform to the actual metropolitan line B you will have walked very far and with luggage it's a pain. line A is even further. \r\nI stayed at milton roma which was a twenty minute walk east of the colisium. But I think you might like something closer to Piazza Navona and vatican. Oh by the way the metropolitan pass is good for the line that takes you to ostia where the beach is.          ",

	{'answer': u'\nnoo. thats just plain rude...and suspicious \r\ni would be furious if i were you.  \r\nsure, they r just "friends" but how well do YOU really know her?          \nIf you think this is normal behavior you need a slap in the face by Reality!!!          \ni would be very upset, that is not normal and i would be very suspicious, get a sitter and suggest he take YOU out instead.          \nNo, i\'m sorry. \r\n \r\n:(          \nNope, not normal at all.          \nIf it is exclusively an Emotional Friendship, then I think the wife needs one too.          \nsuspicious.. it coudl be nothing, but it could be something..  \r\ni hope everything works out. !          \nNo that is disrespectful.          \nDepends on the circumstances. Are they old friends and she just got into town? If this is the case it\'s understandable. If it\'s not the case, start looking for a good lawyer because he\'ll probably be leaving you in the near future.          \nGirl, there is no way I would ever let my husband go to dinner with another woman.  I\'m 23, but I\'m not stupid.  Men are men and they try to sneak there way into making us feel like were wrong.  But we aren\'t wrong.  They are.  All men have one thing on there mind and I don\'t believe any different.  Sorry          \nThat\'s confusing?  Your friend invited a female colleague or your husband? Ask him if you can join.  If he hesitates, then maybe you got something to worry about, maybe.  Why would he need to go out with her anyway?   Business related?          \nNo it is not normal because it will be suspicous unless its for like something important like taking you to your job cuz your car broke down. But then if its not somethin like dat then your wife wiil think your havin sex with her          \nIt is absolutely wrong. If those are genuine colleagues, not a harem of ho\'s he wants to parade around with, he should pop for a babysitter and have you go too.  \r\n \r\nWhat the hell is he thinking????  He\'s NOT.          \nThe mere fact that you asked the question tells me that you allow yourself to be a doormat.  Come on, does it sound normal to you????? \r\n \r\nAnd why would you allow this man to do this to you.  I noticed that you first referred to him as a friend, then you referred to him as your husband.  Which is it???          \nAs a guy, I would say that he is probably having a "relationship" with her.  Doesn\'t mean he is having sex or evening being intimate, but for some reason he needs another female to bond with in order to meet his mental/emotional needs. \r\n \r\nMy advice, don\'t be accusatory, just ask him what they did or talked about and try to meet those needs.  Or if it doesn\'t bother you what they did or talked about, or if you are unwilling to meet those requirements, let them be friends.          \nNO, PERSONALLY THAT WOULD TiCK ME OFF.ESPiCALLY iF i KNEW THAT HE WAS DOiNG THAT i WOULD CLiCK ON HiM LOL. iT iS DiSRESPECTFUL AND iF i KNOW THAT AND i AM A 17 YEAR OLD FEMALE THEN HE SHOULD KNOW iT iZ WRONG.          \nall bad.  this is all bad.          \nit might be ok if they had jus bumped into eachother and got 2 talking but 2 plan it out and things like that  nah dat isnt kool id bring my wife along cuz when i get home itll be on hhaha but its all on a level of maturity not only on ur part but esceially on his part ..this doesnt meen theres sumthing going on its jus not kool unless shes really dang ugly hhaha its not like they are co workers u know or somthing like dat so it isnt kool          \nNOOOOOO!!! It is disrespectful, rude, arrogant and just down right wrong! My husband would much rather take me and the kids out to eat, rather than take some random chick from work.          \nNo, because there is no reason that he should want to spend more time with her than his whole family.  Plus, there is no reason why they should be together alone.  Also, that is not healthy for your children to see that.  They\'re going to think that it is normal for their father to see another women on the side.  Plus, if anyone that the both of you mutually know see them, what would they automatically think?  I would assume that he is cheating.  Also, he is probably telling her that you know that they are seeing eachother, and that it\'s okay with you if they have relations.  I wuold recommend you giving him an ultimatum.  Tell him that you don\'t like it, and if it continues that you will leave.  He\'ll know how you feel, and if he chooses to be continue seeing her, than he has obviously made his decision.  I hope that things don\'t escalate to that, but that is disrespectful to you. \r\nBest of luck!          \nI would have thought he should have discussed it with you first before extending the invitation to his coworker.   \r\n \r\nHonestly, if my husband wanted to go to dinner with his coworker, I wouldn\'t worry about it but we\'ve been together a LONG time and I know it would never be anything but dinner.  \r\n \r\nI often lunch with coworkers myself or sometimes when I have a day off, I\'ll drive my husband to work and then meet a couple of former coworkers (both male and single) for coffee or lunch. On occasion I\'ve met up with them for dinner after work.  \r\n \r\nIt\'s really not a big deal but these people are also our friends and we socialize with them together. \r\n \r\nI would say let it go this time but if it starts to happen regularly, I would sit him down and talk to him. It\'s one thing to lunch or have dinner with coworkers but if it\'s him and a single woman out for dinner socially on a regular basis, this is inappropriate. It would be disrespectful of you and your marriage if he continued. He should be spending that time with you instead of a stranger.          \nNo that is not normal! Everyone should go to dinner together or cook a meal at home. I suggest you find out more about the friend example(is she attractive, have they dated etc.) What is their reason for wanting to be alone together, unless its gonna be more than dinner. It sounds like dinner is a cover for something else. Trust me i\'ve been there. Insist that you be included or offer to make dinner for all of you. If he gets defensive, angry, or is adamant that they be alone something is definitely going on!          \nTo a woman, no it is absolutely not normal. In fact, it does seem suspicious and disrespectful for the woman to come into your home, meet you and your children and then just leave with your husband to go to dinner. I believe there is a place and time for colleagues to get together, perhaps lunch while at work. Or a function where other couples from the job can also participate. For a single woman to be having dinner out, after work ours, with a married man is not okay and you have every right to be concerned. \r\n \r\nTo a man, however, it\'s perfectly normal and okay. \r\n \r\nMen and women think very differently, especially in cases where jealousy or suspicion may take place. Try to talk to your husband and get his stand point on the situation. If you do not feel okay with it, tell him and see how he responds. If he gets very defensive - then there may be more to the story. If not, and he is understanding, and cuts it out then perhaps it was simply just dinner and discussing business. \r\n \r\nYou know your husband better than any of us, so gauge your thoughts and feelings on how he is reacting. Good luck!          \nNo this is hardly normal & your guy knows it\'s not. He is just saying he thinks it\'s normal to make you think you\'re crazy for thinking the way you do. If it\'s business they need to discuss it should be done at the place of business. If this is a friendly visit then you should be included! If you were unable to get a sitter, he could have simply invited this friend to your place for dinner. I don\'t trust it.          \nNo.  Makes no sense at all.  Sometimes business will create situations where this COULD happen but more often than not, there is a way to include the spouse..and it just shouldn\'t happen without it being a large group.  NOT a one on one outing.  Not right at all.  Something stinks there.          \nOk I am confused you said your friend. Is it your friend that did this or your husband? Well if it was your friend it is none of your business. If it was your husband I would want to think that he was not stupid enough to bring a woman into your home that he is cheating with and introduce her as a friend to you and your kids. That would be disrespectful. So, to give him the benefit of the doubt for not being stupid I am going to say that if she is in fact just a friend and is in town and it is a one time thing you should trust your husband but they should not be gone more than two hours. Trust is a big factor in a relationship. Now if he takes your kindness and runs with it you knip it in the butt immediately. But if he introduced you it was a respect factor to let you know that she is just a friend. Trust your husband in this case because he could have went behind your back and then you should worry. If they go out to dinner again I would say ok let me a get a baby sitter and we all can go out as mutual friends. Married people should be mutual friends. If she is his friend and only that he shoudl have no problem with you being her friend too.          \nwell, it does seem a little awkward. however, since he is bringing her home and introducing you to her, i dont think she is a threat. \r\n \r\nif this is teh first time he is doing this: maybe he has a reason. give him teh benefit of doubt. the lady may have some kinda advice she needs from a guy and is not be comfy with you/a girl around. again, i dont think she is a threat. \r\n \r\ni would also suggest not pesterign him with questions about "whys" and "whats" when he returns from dinner. he is actign like a grown man (by bringing the lady home first - instead of pickign her up at her place and worse, not tellign you abotu dinner plans). therefore, you will need to be grown up about this one also (dont stress out if he smellsof smoke or a few drinks, dont sit by the door waitign either).  \r\n \r\nhowever, if he repeats it, then i would be concerened. keep me posted.          \nNormal, no. Inconsiderate, yes. \r\n \r\n  Just out of curiosity, if you had a guy pick you up at home to take you out to dinner and you left your husband with the kids, what would he say. We all know the answer, he\'d be pissed. You should be too.          \nI\'d be suspicious.  In my 20 years of marriage, my husband has cheated with one person (a co-worker)... before the affair began, I remember him talking about her and saying that she and I would get along great.  Him making a point to introduce her may be a warning sign.  When my husband and I discussed the affair (after-the-fact), he mentioned that believing the two of us could be friends was twisted into "unconsenting permission."   \r\n \r\nBottom line, though, is that our marriage wasn\'t healthy at the time.  So before you succumb to my paranoia, consider the health of your marriage.  If it\'s strong, trust that feeling.          ',

	 'question': u"\n    Hi! \r\nIm playing with one of the best jazz bands in San Diego (The Jazz Ensemble).

I still haven't gotten the hang of the omatures. (i know i spelled that wrong,) I'm very nervous because im used to using one sax for extended periods of time. For example, in school i might switch back and forth, but i have a day in advance to know about it, therefore i have time to get used to it. \r\nBut im not sure which sax i have to use.  \r\nHow can i make it easier to switch? and How can i get a great tone out of both regardless of how many times i have to switch? i have about 9 hours to practice since we start playing at 5:30. \r\nany suggestions/tips on successfully switching back and forth without embarrassing myself? \r\n \r\nAlso, i'm used to playing Marching Band and Pep band music, any tips on the way to play jazz? \r\nI know how to distinguish the tounging (da rather than dit) \r\nbut are there any tips on emphasizing it? \r\nHeres a video of the jazz band i'm playing with today: \r\n \r\n \r\nthere are 3 people from my school in this jazz band, as this band consists of people 13-20 years old.

	{'answer': u"\nWell most chinese families are only allowed one child by law so...          \nChina has a law - one kid per family          \nThere's over 1.3 BILLION Chinese in the PRC alone !          \nIn China you are only allowed one child per family. If you want more you have to pay some tax or something          \nis the law of china which force them to have just one kid for a family. is a bad bad bad system \r\nlet's say i have just one baby and i am a 40 years old father, if my child is dead how can i get an other one and even i have tried i will get nothing at that age our wives and have childs more.          \nit's because most chinese couple take care of their virginity wait until they married. unlike some races that produce unwanted babies, then dumped em. btw, i think chinese people are too much into business and make money. i know because my dad's a half chinese and i observe my relative on his side.          \n45%?  really? i'm not so sure about that... maybe you are right, but can you show some facts and figures?? \r\n \r\nMany SMART and EDUCATED Chinese have left Malaysia for greener pastures like Singapore, Australia, UK, USA etc.  So that might add to the lessening of the Malaysian Chinese population \r\n \r\nSecondly, Chinese people are too obsessed with career and education, especially the women too.  so that means chinese marry later.  also because of this work and pressure, the chinese people have to work even harder since they have no NEP or NEM to support them.  they must support themselves.  so that means they are so stressed they can't get their kuku up. \r\n \r\nThirdly, Malaysian Chinese don't really have a sexy culture.  The women are Japanese and Korean wannabes.  The men have ugly Hong Kong or Taiwan hairstyles and they skinny and effeminite looking. \r\n \r\nFourthly.  The Malaysian Chinese has suffered under the tyrannical racist BN government.

We then did NASA and the water parks. If you like rides go to Busch gardens we are hope fully going to go there this year, spend a good whole day there. To any theme park wear trainers that are comfortable and stay on your feet because there are plenty of rides where your legs are dangling in the air.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I am going to Orlando, Florida as a spring trip. And I only have 2 days at the actual amusement park. (well actually about 6-8 hours each of the two days) Do you have any tips on how to get on the most rides in that amount of time? Which rides not to go one. What attractions is a must-go-to? How to save money? What to bring? etc. just some good tips. thank you! :)  ',

	{'answer': u"\n1. It;s expensive, but very cheap to stay in a hostel. \r\n2. No \r\n3. No \r\n4. Trendy, and fashionable in the city. Simple and friendly in the country \r\n5. Yes, they speak Italian, and have darker skin, generally speaking.  \r\n6. Various, depends on city/country, and time of year \r\n7. once again, it depends on when and where you are (just like in America) \r\n8. Anything that you have never had before \r\n9. In April;1: Pesce d'Aprile (April Fool's Day) \r\n             25: Festa della Liberazione (Liberation Day) \r\n             25: San Marco (patron saint of Venezia) \r\n10. I have been to most all of Europe, Italy was my least favorite. Too touristy, and too modern.          \nAs a woman, I'd never travel to Italy by myself... and I'm Italian. It's not safe in a lot of cities if you don't speak the language or know the social rules. Even if you do speak Italian, it's not safe for women to travel alone at night or on trains at night. If a man is too forward or assaults you, the woman is blamed if she is not with another person. They say she asked for it. People ask all the time on here... should I travel to Italy alone. Only if you are a man. Women can't travel to a lot of countries alone. Some would be fine and others are not fine. Most people give me thumbs down for this, but I've had too many problems. I'd never do it as a woman ever. I've had too many female friends assaulted by Italian men. Even their government is getting fed up with this.          \n1) It depends on what type of accommodation you stay in and what type eateries you take your meals in, and how you get around. \r\n2) Greece is a completely different country. Which are you going to, Greece or Italy? \r\n3) No, they are not necessary in Italy. \r\n4) I found Italians to be generally quite pleasant and friendly. \r\n5) They dress more stylishly, and are not afraid to wear pretty floral shirts or eaux-de-toilette. They are also very keen on grooming, and it's very common to see men with nicely shaped eyebrows, good haircuts, etc. in Italy. It's not considered gay there, it's just what men do. \r\n6)You'd have to look that up on www.hostelworld.com or a similar website, because it depends on where you go and the time of year. \r\n7) People dress to suit the season, and stylishly. Obviously international fashion also has some influence. Natural fibres are the norm. \r\n8) All of it. Seriously, it's all good. \r\n9) Depends on where you're going. Invest in a good travel guide book, that should include regional festivals. \r\n10) It's a lovely place to go. But be open-minded.          \n.1 How much does it cost if i wanna stay there for a month? \r\n \r\ndepends if you want to rent an appartment or stay in a hotel or B&B... Different parts of italy have different costs \r\n \r\n2. Did you go to Greece and if so what was it like? :) no \r\n \r\n \r\n3. Do u get travelers shots? \r\n \r\nno \r\n4. How are the people? \r\n \r\nKind, Friendly \r\n5. Are italian men different then American men? \r\nMuch different. \r\n \r\n6. How much does a bed & breakfast cost for each night? \r\n??? \r\n \r\n7. Hows the dressing attire? \r\nanything you want, but dress and cover nicely in churches \r\n \r\n8. What foods should i try? \r\nPASTA!  - if your going to naples, you have to get pizza \r\n \r\n9. If im going in April what festivals are there at this time \r\nPASQUA - Easter \r\n \r\n10.

	{'answer': u'\nStop bangin the neighbor lady already.          \nLOL thats just bad luck. \r\nif she doesnt trust you then theres not too much you can do to take it back, she needs to  trust you before she believes you didnt cheat on her          \nmove.          \nooh that sucks.. \r\ntell her you love her so much and you would never do anything like that to her. \r\nand then call your guy neighbor and have him tell your wife that he asked you to clean the driveway for him          \nman that\'s good writing! try a romance novel          \nWhile she\'s distracted with your neighbor is a perfect time for you to bang someone else while her attention is diverted.          \nquit acting suspicious.  thanx for the laugh if this is real i\'m sorry but once you get over it you\'ll look back and laugh.          \nI would think a smart thing to do would be to save the message, then have your neighbors come over together. This would be the smartest way to remove any doubts from either your wife or the male neighbors mind, should he be made aware.          \ni\'m thinking its a joke but women......ugg....either talk to the neighbors and have them tell her that she isn\'t sleeping with you or whatever. and you are clear or try to convince her some other way          \nwow......... \r\n \r\nWell you might have to bring her husband in to confirm this. \r\n \r\nHonestly I would sit her down and ask her what this is really about. Do the old "Honey we have been married __blah years and I love you just as much now as I did when we said I do. Do you really think I would give that up to have an affair with my neighbors (or best friends) wife?" \r\n \r\nYou should also tell her something along the lines that if you did in fact have an affair with her she wouldn\'t have been stupid enough to leave a message on the home answering machine. I think you would be a little smarter then that, she should give you some credit. \r\n \r\nHope that helps          \nHave Lisa\'s husband tell your wife what was going on. Now if you were flirting with his wife, he would be equally be pissed off.  (maybe, some might be delighted), anyways if she knows of their relationship, I am sure she will understand.          \ntell her that she needs to "clean up the mess at your house."  Or she can start having you do more plowing at your house.          \nWell, if your wife is not atubborn, why don\'t you print out this note. This asking. And also did you sit her down and explain. Even have the lady come over. But I am not sure that is the best idea. But i would stop doing her driveway, get another friend to do it          \nlol lol lol!!!! My sides hurt!!!  ha ha!!  =)          \nIts silly, you are both talking about "snow removal," right?  Tell her that your friend asked you a favor, and God has said, "Love thy neighbor," and you are following his words.  I\'d be angry with her, tell her that you don\'t get this kind of icy reception, from your friend\'s wife!          \nIf your wife doesn\'t believe you when you tell the truth, then she either has good reason to mistrust you, or simply has her own set of trust issues. \r\n \r\nsorry          \nHave her talk to Lisa and get it straighten out.          \nif the ***** really said that she\'s just trying to cause trouble. \r\nbut i know you made this crap up.          \nWow! That\'s great stuff. Nine inches! You\'re the man!  Plow on!          \nYou even cleaned up your mess? You must have been sober. \r\nI dont know Ted....you got some splaining to do. \r\nHere ...I\'ll get you a drink. makes you think better.          \nlol, I think I would have done the same thing....ha ha ha ha. \r\n \r\nLook just dont give up on telling her nothing happened..if you do, this will give her more proof that you did. Oh, one more thing, get your old stuff out of your house!!!  Things like this ALWAYS get you in trouble.          \nSleep with who you want, but be discreet. Easy rule. Just remember: Who she sleeps with is her business and not yours, too.          \njust tell her that your not having and affair with the neighbor. let het know how important she is to you and that you would risk it.the stuff from high school tell her to let it go it was like a long time ago.          \nRemind your wife that you cleared her driveway too, allowing her to keep her date with her boyfriend.          \nI don\'t know...stop blowing her? \r\n \r\nHope this helps!          \nDifficult situation mate, just make your wife understand that you were doing a favor to Mike and that was him who left you the key to clean the driveway for lisa while your neighbor was away.          \nTell her you hate the neighbour. Tell her that she\'s shaved her nether hairs into a smiley face and it creeped you out.  \r\n \r\nOh wait-.....          \nDon\'t bother; the seeds of mistrust seem already sown. It\'s not worth the fight. I\'d just leave.          \nIf it were me Ted, then I would just go right ahead and shag your neighbour then you wouldn\'t have to try and convince the wife that you weren\'t having an affair with her.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Long story, but I\'ll try to keep it short. Last week, my neighbor Mike told me he was going to be out of town for a few days. The forecast called for snow over the weekend. He asked me if I could possibly plow out his driveway for him while he was away. His wife Lisa ( whom I have known since I was 12) works a weird night schedule, so he would just leave the keys in the truck and have it ready to go. \r\n  \r\n  Well, we got about 9"inches of snow last weekend. I cleared my driveway, and then went over to clear theirs. My wife also works weird schedules and had no idea I had done this.  \r\n  After clearing the driveway, and shoveling off the steps and walkways, I left a note telling her I had done this and to make sure she took the keys back into the house. \r\n \r\n  She called to thank me a couple days later. She left a message on our machine that said " Thanks for plowing me the other night...you do much better than my husband...blah, blah,  ...he usually makes me finish myself and clean up all the mess..blah blah...,," \r\n \r\n  Well my wife heard this and assumed she was not referring to snow removal. She accused me of cheating on her with Lisa.  She also brought up my High School yearbook where Lisa wrote the typical good bye / good luck thing  but added " if you would have asked me again, I would have said yes!" \r\n   \r\n  So, with these two pieces of " evidence " , she is now accusing me of having an affair.  How can I make her believe me?  I would rather not bring this to the attention of the neighbors.  ',

	{'answer': u"\nPhuket is too darn hot, almost any time of year.  Too hot to go outside and walk a block, let alone go to the beach.   \r\n \r\nI personally like Siem Reap, Cambodia.  Plenty of temples (Raiders of the Lost Ark was filmed there), really friendly people (our driver showed up 15 minutes before we needed him every time), really inexpensive ($3.50 meals, $10 for a tuk-tuk driver for the whole day, $15 for a guide), and it has a fun tourist vibe and is full of foreigners.  It has a fun night market and also a day market.  Flights come mostly from Bangkok, so that would be a good place to combine.  No beaches though, and can get to be very hot and humid. \r\n \r\nFor beaches, I like Guam--it is like Hawaii with friendlier locals and some very empty beaches.  You can combine Guam with a stopover in Tokyo which is full of sites, is very modern, interesting, and clean.          \nGo to Thailand, you will LOVE it believe me. Great shoppings, beautiful beaches and lots of history and also modern. \r\n \r\nPattaya is good for beaches and nigh club: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPhi phi Island is BEAUTIFUL: \r\n \r\n \r\nAyutthaya is a very famous and historical place in Thailand, very well known and everyone who go to Thailand should go there, it was Thai kingdom that existed from 1350 to 1767. : \r\n \r\n \r\nVisit the province of Kanchanaburi, you can see Death Railway/The bridge over the river kwai, and many other historical site, I've been there and love it: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Ancient City or Muang Boran in Samut Prakan: \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHere are the list of many Thai beaches that you can not miss  BEAUTIFUL!!!!! \r\n \r\n \r\nGO TO THAILAND AND YOU WOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED BELIEVE ME!!!          \nThere are many great cities in Asia.  It all depends on what you are looking for. Here are a few ideas. \r\n \r\nIn Beijing there are great sites to see on vacation such as: the Summer Palace, the Great Wall of China, the Forbidden City, and more. \r\n \r\nIn Tokyo you can travel to the man made island of Odaiba to see space age buildings, electric cars, a monorail and the world\u2019s largest Ferris wheel. Take a day trip to Mt Fuji, Lake Ashi and Bullet Train back to Tokyo.  Consider visiting two theme parks at the Disney Resort.  \r\n \r\nHong Kong Tourism has much to offer.   \r\n\u2022  See breathtaking views on the top of Victoria Peak.  \r\n\u2022 Visit a shopper\u2019s paradise in Tsim Sha Tsui. \r\n\u2022 See amazing lifelike images of famous people in Madame Tussauds. \r\n \u2022 Visit the Hong Kong Museum of History.  \r\n \r\nBest, \r\n \r\nChuck          \nSingapore is turning to be a very beautiful city, give it a try. \r\nThe other gem in Asia, quite hidden is Bhutan.  \r\nHave a read about Bhutan and hope u will travel there \r\n \r\nFor travel deals in Asia, check out www.Wego.com          \nAgenda's agenda's.   \r\nCut through the BS.  Bali is the best place to visit in the world and trust me I have seen much of it.  \r\nSiem Reap in Cambodia is a close second.  But Bali gives you so many choices.  From world famous beach's to classic temples,  beauty on a scale that is hard if not impossible to duplicate and enough culture and art to make your stay memorable and personal.  From the highly touristed areas of Kuta and Legian to the deserted and romantic islands of the Gilis and Nusa Lembognan (no cars or motor bikes allowed) to the Culture and art of Ubud.  \r\nBali is just the best!

	{'answer': u"\nI don't like Apple products to be honest.          \nI have the ipad 2 and it is good. I think the ipad 3 has siri. Also the retina display from what I heard is pretty impressive, but I don't think I would give up my ipad 2 for it.          \nThe iPad 3 would definitely be a good present for Christmas. In my opinion, it just an exact version of an iPod put onto a larger screen, and with the price range it isn't that worth it. Whatever the price, I love all my apple products and have been buying mac electronics for the past 3 years, and I'm always satisfied with the simplicity and mobility. The iPad does indeed have Siri, as it inheret iOS 5 which is put into all the iPhones/iPods/iPads          \nThat's cool, I am getting several video games, All Star Shoes, and hopefully an Xbox router.          \nI agree with Pip Boy, I generally don't like apple either.          \nAwesome, I have one :D \r\n \r\n          \nI believe it has Siri, yes. It's less helpful then you might think, but some people love it. The iPad 3 has the retina display so your screen will look brilliant. Under the hood is has the A5X processor a 1GHz dual core. The 3 still used the 30 pin connector so you won't have the new lightning connector, but that's not a a huge deal. If you are getting the cellular model it has 4G LTE coverage.  \r\n \r\nSo overall, yes it's a fairly good tablet.          \nIt has sire, and the itunes store it full of cool apps. The only problem I heard with the ipad 3 is that it has a overheating problem, that it gets hotter than the two ipads before it. It's also very costly. More than I would ever spend on a tablet.

	{'answer': u"\nThese questions are Always so subjective.......because it depends what you plan on eating, and where....and hostel availability....or whether you will need a better room, and so forth.  \n \nThere's travel expenses and perhaps Museum entrance fees.....hard to say what your DAILY quota will be.  \n \nTrains are cheap, but certainly not free.....and fines for being caught traveling without a ticket are steep.  \n \nI'd figure $75 to $100 a day..........but then 300 people will get on  here, and say that's either not  enough or way too much......and some clown will tell you how he did it all for less than $10 a day.  \n \nYeah, good luck with that........but trains and a place to stay, plus food..........you better have at least  75 **EURO** a day......and that's about $100, with the Exchange rate these days.  And that's a lowball end......assuming you find REALLY cheap accomadations.....and don't like to eat much.          \nAccording to Hostelbookers.com you can obtain a night in your chosen Italian  \ncities for 10 - 14 euros.  Meals can be cheap with pizza's found away from the  \nmain centres of the cities. Supermarkets offer cheap milk. Your biggest cost will  \nbe entrance tickets to the attractions like the Uffizi and Pompeii. \nI hope this was some help.  If you have a year to save you can afford a treat  \nthere every other day.          \nThis is hard question to answer.  \nYour main costs will be accommodation, transport and food.  \n \nFor accommodation try websites like www.hostels.com, www.hostelworld.com or www.hostelbookers.com. Some have ratings which are useful but you can put in the dates you want and see what the costs are. You will notice some places will be more expensive. I found Venice and Florence the most expensive.  \n \nIn Florence I stayed in a campground that had cabins....incredibly thin walls and about a 50 min bus ride from Florence but 10 years ago it was about 80euros for 3 nights compared to the same price for one night in Florence itself.   \nIn Venice I wanted to stay 2 nights in Venice but didn't want to stay in a hostel for both nights so split it. Had a lovely room overlooking a canal in a 2 star hotel Messener (10 years ago now). \n \nTrenitalia.com is the website to go to for trains. You can again put in dates and see how long and how much trains cost.  \n \nWhen I was in Rome I did a day tour to Pompeii, which I can recommend because I didn't have to worry about anything, just got on the bus and that was that. I thought it was good value as it included transport to and from hotel, lunch, entry into Pompeii and a guide. I wish I would have added on the extra to either Capri or Sorrento now....anyhow. \n \nBreakfasts are usually included in hotels (not so much in hostels), lunches would be about 10-20 euros and dinners 20-30 euros. I guess if you cook your own it would be cheaper but hey, when in Italy eat their food I say!          \n100 to 150 euros a day, as has essentially been said, would be my minimum to have a nice time.  Why go to Italy when you can't do or see anything that costs money?  I will say that when we go there we eat our way across the country.  It's Italian cuisine, and one reason we enjoy it.  In Florence we paid 120 euros for three, for dinner, and it was worth every centime.  I almost never eat pizza in Italy.          \nI agree the other answers, but I want to give you a last advice. If you want to eat the real pizza you should come in Naples ( the pizzas that the Italians do in the other cities are more different from the pizzas that do in Naples!) for the foreigners, the pizzas that do in Rome are great, but for a Neapolitan is not found particularly good... For this, you are enough time to visit Naples, which I think is more beautiful then Venice ( which is limited little more than the canals, gondole and Piazza San Marco) Naples has a lot more to offer. I recommend you to do so: \n \n4 days in Venice (in 4 days, maybe, you can visit Verona too)  \n \n5 days in Florence ( if you want you can take the train for Pisa, but Pisa has only the Tower and the Duomo, It's all here!)  \n \n6 days in Rome (there's a lot of monuments to see!)  \n \n3 days in Naples \n \n1 days to Pompei ( from Naples you can go to Pomepii with the Circumvesuviana)  \n \nAnd in all the others day from Naples you can visit Vesuvius, Herculaneum, Sorrento, the Amalfitana Coast, Capri, Ischia and the Royal Palace of Caserta. This is my advice, you have enough time to see much more! Good travel and I hope that you will like the Italy!  \n \nIf you want other info, you can write me in private!  \n \nExcuse me for my poor English!          ",

	{'answer': u'\nThere are parts of Italy,  where even though they are speaking Italian, (supposedly)......even other Italians would be hard pressed to understand them.   Sardo, spoken in Sardegna, is virtually incomprehensible to mainland Italians.  In the Liguria region, near France,  the dialect is infused with many French words. Up near Austria.....some German sneaks in.  The accents alone,  run the entire spectrum. The Naples and Sicilian accent are often the most mocked.  Up North....if you speak with an accent from Naples......you stick out like a sore thumb.  \n \nKinda like you would with a deep Southern accent,  up North in the United States.   It\'s just wayyyyyyyyy out of place, and clearly obvious.          \nItalian is different from english. The way you pronounce a vowel doesn\'t change the meaning of a word. open, close, long, short, it\'s the same. So the most part of italians really don\'t know how to pronounce a vowel. Each region (21) has got its own pronounciation.  \nAnyway everybody can understand eachother.          \nItaly has 20 different regions and each has a slightly different dialect/accent. Regardless, people can still understand eachother. I guess it would be similar to a "southern accent" un the US          ',

	{'answer': u'\ngive up on firefox it has too many problems in the latest editions try orca, k-meleon or flock all mozilla browsers like firefox but faster and without the problems, firefox help and mozillazine both deny there are any problems but there are hundreds of reported problems with firefox all over the internet. check your task manager firefox sometimes opens multiple times and freezes the computer something mozillazine "experts" say is impossible,  \r\nAlso \r\nCould be  a rootkit virus it can hijack your browser but without any windows open it can send you to advertising sites etc. Download "rootkit revealer" from Microsoft or Sysinternals and run it, These things can disable normal antiviruses and anti malware. Go to Task manager and under processes see if there is an oddnamed process sometimes just random letters and or numbers and end process. Then go to Start>run and type in msconfig and click OK, Look under the "startup" tab and uncheck the same process name if it appears there. The registry will need to be cleaned up but normal programs should be able to do that when you have disabled the rogue program. \r\n \r\nThese things can disable recognised anti-malware programs and system tools like task manager, so you may have to download process explorer or killprocess to stop the process, you need also to rename the malware bytes .exe file to, say for example,  xxxx.exe or just copy it to the same folder when it will produce a copy called "copy of..." and run that.

When I asked why I was told because there were too many emails in there and the account only holds so many (I didn't know that).  So I went in there and someone apparently had fun sending emails from my account, 500 of them in fact.

	 'question': u"\n    If so, beware, and don't open them.  I recently lost 2 email accounts (I've seen a couple of other people report similar things).  On the other accounts, which I can no longer log on to, I initially received an email from someone using my own name (the name I originally used for opening that account).  Curiosity made me open them and what I received was an advertisement for vitamin supplements.  That was probably a sprat to catch a mackerel.  I did not do anything else - just closed down - but next time I tried to log on I couldn't and received a message asking for some personal details 'required to help me reactivate my account'.  I answered just one question - correctly - and was told it was the wrong answer and was then asked for further information which I did not answer.  When I tried to log on to the other account I received the same message but ignored it as I realised that some scam must be going on.  \r\n \r\nA few weeks ago I opened this account that I am using now as a replacement for the first one I lost, and on logging on this morning the first incoming email appeared to be from ME.   I immediately deleted it and am now using the account as normal.  It is the opening of these emails which give access to someone else.  Why they do this I don't know, whether there is financial gain I don't know or whether it is just to show that they can I don't know. Whatever the reason it does seem very sinister and leaves me wondering what these people are doing with my own account now that I cannot access it. \r\n \r\nTo any of you who have not had this experience, yet, I just wish to warn you so that you don't lose your account.  Someone else has told me that the biggest problems are caused for those who have a large address book and rarely clear old emails.  The hacker has access to everything in that account and can then send similar emails to all the names in the address book and continue doing this every time someone opens one of these fake emails.  \r\n \r\nIf you receive one of these emails mark it as SPAM initially and then delete it without opening.

	{'answer': u'\nduuno. doubt it.          \nWell talk to your neighbours be blunt be like "Man were going to have to take you to court tell them how you feel. \r\nIf you take them to court it will feel wired living next to them. Try coming at it from a friendly aproch first.          \nactually park up your drive or what? \r\nif they are interfering with your everyday lives for no proper reason then yeah go ahead \r\nor sink  to their level and do stuff to p them off - wouldn\'t recommend this tho - slightly childish          \nThe sale of your home is in the future  How much is peace is worth??          \neither way your going to have to tell people about the problems with your neighbours, so I would take legal action against them, if thats sorted and they behave then at least if you sell the house you can say it was resolved. \r\n \r\nCan you get thier car towed away as its on private property? I would ha ha          \nYou have a legal obligation  to tell prospective purchasers if you have had bother with neighbours. It\'s NEVER worth falling out with your neighbours.   \r\n \r\nI urge you not to take legal action.  \r\n \r\nI feel there may be more to this story so it\'s hard to comment further.  But for god\'s sake don\'t get into some kind of "feud" becuase it will consume your whole life, your health will suffer.  And all for a garage.          \nHave the vehicle towed away.  When the neighbors have to pay towing and storage charges to get the vehicle back, they may get the message.          \nYes, take them to court.  The court will most likely hand down an injunction, which is a court order instructing your neighbors not to block your driveway with their cars.  If this is handed down, you will then be able to call the police to enforce this injunction if your neighbors continue to park in front of your driveway.  \r\n \r\nYou going to court chould not affect your (or your neighbor\'s) ability to sell your respective homes.  This is a civil matter and it would not be an issue if you or your neighbors decide to move.          \nIf it is your land you can put up notice wheel clamping in operation \xa3100 charge  to remove wheel clamp.Or you can put up notices and get a private company to tow the vehicle away ,than they can get it back for a release fee.          \nYou could do with advise from a Solicitor, I\'m not sure whether you would get 1/2hrs free consultation on land matters, you could phone and ask. GOOD LUCK!!          \nThis makes no sense that the police won\'t get this resolved.  Both the police and the courts are in the same justice system.  All garages at people\'s homes are on private property.  If your neigbor is blocking your garage on your property, then the police have the right and the duty to resolve the conflict.  You should call and talk to a police chief or person in charge and not a patrolman. \r\n \r\nBut you can take them to court to resolve the issue.  Doubt it will effect the future sale of your house, but you are going to be leaving the same problem for someone else.          \nYou will have to tell a prospective buyer about an unresolved dispute anyway whether you take it to Court or not. in that respect you are in a no win situation.          \nStop whingeing you chirper; there is always two sides to the story!!!          \nI had a similar problem when my neighbour had guests as my neighbours friend parked in front of my garage. Then one time when I was out they parked on my drive and where pissed off when I came home and blocked them in for a week they asked me to move my car I said no as it was not convenient for me to move it, just as it was not convenient for me to be blocked in by them every time they wanted to park on my drive, again the cops would not get involved as it was on private land. So it was basically fcuk you to the neighbours. They did it one more time so I let their tyres down but only halfway so that they would not notice they where low on air and told them in no uncertain terms to get the thing shifted they crashed the vehicle not long after that and I have never had the problem since          \nIt is seldom a good idea taking neighbours to court, as there is always bad blood afterwards.  The police should be prepared to intervene where you need to go somewhere urgently and are unable to have access to your car and it is a pity that they will not help. The only thing for it, therefore, is to seek a civil injunction against your neighbours at the local County Court. The effect of this would be that if they were to block your garage in the future, they could be committed to prison for contempt. (That isn\'t as easy as it sounds: imagine living next door to a neighbour whom you\'d had committed to prison!)  \r\nAs far as selling your house is concerned, you would have to disclose the action to any potential buyer if you sold within the next (I think) six years.          \nGo to court apply to claim all expenses against your neighbour in a civil action.  Keep them informed of the fact that they may have to pay for proceedings. see if it works , if not go ahead with a no win no fee solicitor          \nIn England and Wales, private companies may clamp vehicles that are parked on private land. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) now licenses such companies. \r\n \r\nMediation services \r\n \r\nBefore registering a formal complaint it is a good idea to try talking to your neighbour about the problem. If you find this intimidating or would like some support, various community mediation services are available. Mediation UK is a national voluntary organisation which aims to help resolve conflicts in communities. You can search for services in your area using their website \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nConsult a solicitor/take court action \r\n \r\nSolicitor\u2019s letter \r\n \r\nA letter from a solicitor may be helpful in making a neighbour realise that you are serious about your complaint. It may be particularly effective in making tenants realise that the next stage might be eviction by their landlord. It may also be necessary when, for example, there is genuine disagreement as to who is responsible. \r\n \r\nTaking court action \r\n \r\nAlthough a particular dispute may be resolved successfully through the courts, the relationship between neighbours may be damaged. It is also an extremely expensive course of action to take unless the complainant is eligible for publicly-funded legal services \r\n \r\nIf you take action against your neighbour you would have to declare this to the purchaser when you get the questions from their Solicitor, \r\n \r\nWhy not just put a lockable post in position on the drive which can be locked in place preventing anyone parking in that spot, and unlocked and drop down when you need to gain access to it, there is one here for 49.99 \r\n \r\n          \nIf you have an ongoing dispute with neighbours then it could devalue your property as you must declare this. Taking legal action could prove very costly.          \nContact your local security services company that has a parking enforcement section.  Contrary to some people\'s answers, you cannot put up a sign and clamp the vehicle or block them in or tow them away for a release fee legally, unless you have the appropriate SIA licences.  You can clamp the vehicle, if you have no intention to charge for release and you release immediately upon being requested to do so!  This would be far more inconvenient to  you though! \r\n \r\nA parking enforcement company will normally put up appropriate signage (Compliant with "Arthur Vs Anker") and immobilise any obstructing vehicle, upon your requst, normally without cost to you.  Costs are recovered from offenders. \r\n \r\nOne word of warning!!  If you clamp a vehicle, you may be accused of damage, even if you did not cause any - it is a common whinge from parking offenders.  Before clamping, take photos of the wheel to be clamped and the car after clamping, preferably showing the signage and the registration number in the same frame.  Also, what clamp victims do not realise is that it is actually illegal to attempt to remove a clamp (Torts "Interference with Goods" Act) and criminal damage if they break it off! \r\n \r\nMy suggestion is to get the professionals in - you can be sure then that the signage will be legal (It is amazing how many aren\'t), that licences will be held (Make sure you check) and the appropriate insurances are in place (View certificates).  All you will need to do is sign a consent to the provision of service that states the place immobilisation is to be used (It is a legal requirement for the service provider to have written consent to immobilise).  It is then fully legal for the company used to immobolise and tow away offending vehicles.  It does work.  Check the link for the legal details regarding vehicle immobilisers - good luck.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I have had an ongoing problem with my neighbours blocking our garage, the land is private, so the police, council etc will not get involved (believe me we have sounded all this out) We have approached our neighbours many times but they leave the garage clear for a couple of days then start blocking it again.  This has been going on for over a year. We have consulted the Citizens advice Bereau and they have advised us to take legal action, and this seems to be our only option. we have threatened our neighbours with this before but still they took no notice of us. We are now left with no choice but to go ahead with legal action........my question is, what effect will this legal action have on us if we decide in the future to sell our house with our neighbours are still in situ ?- are we effectively making our house (and theirs) unsellable ?

	{'answer': u'\nMy thoughts on that quote are that I should pack up and move to New England. I would be very happy there amongst my peers it seems.          \nBasically, he meant it would be a challenge to convert Connecticut\'s Christians into right-wing lunatics.          \n2 items for you \r\n \r\n1) I live in CT... what do you know of me? not that a sample of one is statistically significant. \r\n2) I think Palau is an ear-tickler. To use a \'christian\' term. \r\n \r\nedit--- \r\n \r\nI consider myself an agnostic theist...  \r\nYes, all of New England is that way. \r\nAnd I don\'t think that highly of Mr. Palau... he seems too much into the "emerging church movement" with I feel is the great apostasy redux.          \nPerhaps Palau is the type of fellow who sees an Atheist or at least an Agnostic behind every rock. \r\n \r\nI think that smells like pot and zombie are correct.          \nGoing to church doesn\'t make a Christian. There are a lot of wonderful churches in that area. But how empty inside are they, and how many people go to church every Sunday. \r\n \r\nI think is the same thing that is happening in the Bible Belt as well. I think taking on the name Christian makes people feel better about themselves. It is when you take up that cross and follow Christ that the tire meets the road. And many don\'t want to take that step of faith, it is a tough one.          \nI think the best thing would be to ask Mr. Palau for clarification if you need it. I do not know the context in which he was speaking at the time. Context is important! \r\n \r\n \r\nGod bless you. \r\n \r\n<edit> \r\nBarbara, thank you for taking the time to email me the information. I see that someone named Adam Bowles from the Connecticut section of the New York Times supplied this quote to the publication you sent me. Again it seems to me there may have been more to the original quote than was printed. This is often the case. Again, check with the source. I am not saying that Luis Palau is incapable of making a mistake. I am just saying that what ended up in print may not accurately portray the intent. \r\n \r\nJournalists have to fit their stories into the limited space they are given. Sometimes they innocently edit sentences out for the sake of space. What may not seem important to them at the time can end up being crucial to the intent and context of the quote within the story. \r\n \r\n<edit> \r\nMaybe I am missing your point all together. Are you saying that the Polis Center pie chart is wrong? If you are, I guess that is as much a possibility as anything. Have you checked out their data gathering and compilation practices and procedures? How did they arrive at their percentages?          \nSounds like a poor excuse for poor performance. \r\n \r\nIn show-biz they would have said he "died" there.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    On a visit to preach in Connecticut in 2001, evangelist Luis Palau gave this qoute to Adam Barnes of the New York Times: \r\n \r\n"New England is a tough place.  They tend to keep to themselves.  Atheism, or at least agnosticism, has a tremendous foothold here.  In New England, when you say \'Christian\' they think \'those maniacs on the right\'.

	{'answer': u"\nGet a lawyer.          \nIf no police report if filed and all he has is some photos he doesnt have a lot to go on if you deny everything. it is a you said he said thing. You need that police report to file anything with the insurance and since technically both of you left the scene of an accident you are both at fault. he may be in just as much trouble as you. Now what you should do though is MAN UP and fix your mistake pay off that crash as soon as possible and then some. he could have just as easily called the cops and you would be screwed.  \n \nAccording to Obi Wan the statue of limitations doesnt apply..  Unless a police report is filed at the scene everything else is void. Im not saying skip out but in this situation a few pictures doesnt mean squat and so I can say hey you are the driver still means squat. You cant go to a police station and say hey a few weeks ago i was in an accident and never called left the scene  and now since the guy wont pay im gonna cry about it.. it doesnt work that way. I have had this happen to my wife a few years back she was rear ended the lady driving said to exchange info and not call the cops we filed a claim our insurance sent a letter to the owner of the other car who at the time was in jail and his GF was driving without a license to verify everything  they didnt respond so the insurance after 30 days assumed our claim was valid. That police report is the golden ticket to verification. since both of you left he has some photos of what if maybe... ok if you and your dad wanted to be jerks about it you could lie but you should pay for what you have done. the only way this guy may get anything is if he goes to small claims court and can prove without a shadow of a doubt you and that car hit his car. and he didnt doctor some photos together and pull a random name from a phone book..          \nDon't listen to James on this. \n \nIf you don't pay him as much as he wants, you and Dad can end up in a world of hurt.  But the important amount isn't what the other guy wants, it's what your dad agreed to pay. \n \nNobody else saw the crash, but that doesn't mean squat.  If he files a police report and insurance claim and then you deny everything, nobody on earth will believe you.  You'll be asked things like if you weren't even there, how come this guy has photos and the plate number and can identify you as the driver?  You won't have a logical answer to that, and that's where you'll be caught.  The other guy has all the proof he needs. \n \nThe only good advice is for your dad to pay for the damage, and get a receipt for each and every payment.  If your dad refuses, he can and will be sued and the police will likely get involved.  You can face charges of driving without a licence and driving without valid insurance (you won't go to jail but it's still legal trouble), and your dad could face charges of criminal negligence endangering a minor (which could mean jail time), and you don't want that.          \nhahah, he does a good deed for you  by not calling the cops and now you want to screw him .  You sound like a future Democrat voter.          \nSo you agreed to something after he saved you by not calling the police and getting you ticketed for driving without a license and insurance, and instead of being grateful for that now you are looking for a way to get out of what you agreed to.  Does that sum it up? \n \nWell, obviously you and dad can refuse to pay and he would have no real way to make you without some effort on his part, legally anyway. \n \nBut there is the concept of karma or the golden rule if you prefer.  What is the right thing to do? \n \nAnd keep in mind if he does call the police and they do investigate, what then?  Are you going to compound it by not being truthful? \n \nBottom line is, I guess, this.  Are you a man of your word, or not?          \ni agreeeeee          ",

	{'answer': u"\nLiving a long life is somewhat genetic. Most people who live really long lives are very healthy to near the end. People with chronic issues like COPD generally aren't survivors much past 80. Mom died last summer at 86 from cancer and it seemed tragic for her to die so young, just a year before her doctor had told her there was nothing she had that would prevent her living to 120. Her mother died at 98 from nothing, not keeping her body temp warm enough so went to the hospital a week or two before and they said nothing was wrong with her. Mom's sister will be 86 this weekend and survived cancer twice and heart problem. First cancer was almost 35 years ago, they said terminal but she needed to stay alive because she wasn't done raising her special needs son so she took chemo and it worked, 5 years later another cancer, about 5 years ago they said her heart was so bad she couldn't have surgery or it would kill her but not expect to live long. She still lives alone now she was widowed last year, maybe too stubborn to let the issues kill her.          \nThis true, I suppose there is a time for everything. Health wise some of us have good genes to help ward off many illnesses. Others choose risky lifestyles. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time can get you killed no matter how good of genes you have. Others battle life long illness for years without succumbing. Others hardly sick a day in their life, bam taken out by a simple bacteria get out of hand. Why do some survive a plane crash and others not with the same type injuries... Just a time to go I guess.          \nIt's our pigheadedness!  We have a lousy day; go to bed, and wake up next morning ready to kill dragons! \n \nWe also realize that we are on borrowed time and try to make the best of each day that we are given.          \nluck and pluck. got me this far. where the journey ends no one knows.          \nSheer bloody-mindedness in my case.  \nI was once a meek wee thing who worked like a horse and allowed myself to be bullied and put-upon. Then twenty years ago I got up on my hind legs and stood my ground. Now no one messes unless they relish a long, hard fight.          \nI received some rather devastating news about my health and my future 8 years ago and mentally I was ready to give up. But my body must not have got the message and I'm still living. That was proof enough to me that one should never give up and I'm feeling better now than I have in years despite heart problems, leukemia, prostate cancer and diabetes.          \nfor me it's because of my faith in God          \nNot dying          ",

PLEASE DONT BE EMBARASSED NOR OFFENDED BY MY E-MAIL TO YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT OUT OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE I CHOOSE TO CONTACT YOU. Is obvious we don\u2019t know each other yet, but we don\u2019t know why nature is crossing our path today. Meeting new people in our lives is a never-ending circle. You are like God sent to me today as I type this email for you. You may think this is too good to be real, but I am telling you today that as God lives, this is as real as the air both of us breathe \r\n \r\nLet me start by Formally introducing myself to you. I am Attorney Fabian Yadao  a Legal Practitioner representing Rev. Fr. FERDINAND De Guzman,  My late client was a 64 years Old Filipino Catholic Reverend Father who came here in Nigeria in the 1945 with a black Missionary Rev. Sister; He left Philippines at the age of five(5), after The Japanese invading of the Philippines. He said the experience is cataclysm. However, he lived all his life here and owned an NGO which receives Financial Aid (Grant) from the United Nation and other conglomates. He died of Asthma attack, and since then no one has come forward to claim this fund he deposited in a Bank here, which he intend to use in establishing a foundation for Charity homes and orphanage centers in third world countries as he has been doing secretly. \r\n \r\nAlso to the issue-Based on my relationship with my client, he informed me of some wonderful ideas he wants to embark on which was to build one or two  churches  around the third wave countries and Asia and also donate monies to churches, and also to less privilege homes around the globe too with this deposit of US$2.800.000.00m he made through a CODED account in his local bank here in Africa which he gave me the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT to keep as his lawyer.  \r\n \r\nTHE BANK Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, had just started arrangement for the fund to be declared "Unclaimed" and subsequently be donated as trust fund for arms/ ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa for their selfish political interest/investment. In order to avert this negative development, I hereby need your cooperation in order to see that the Will of my late client is actualized. I can never achieve this objective without a trustworthy foreigner and this is where you come in. \r\nHowever, I want to seek your consent to present you as a relative to My deceased client by virtue of Power of attorney. As attorney to the deceased the responsibility to establish your relationship with my client rest on me and to achieve this objective, there are judicial processes involved, which I will brief you on subsequent correspondence if you indicate interest. Also take note that this is 100% risk free and legal. \r\n \r\nI am not pursuing this claim for the financial gain. It is a duty I owe to my late client who unfortunately was an orphan with no existing relatives and even as I intend to use part of the funds to establish a foundation in his name in the philippines; notwithstanding you will be adequately rewarded for your assistance in this endeavor I have decided to offer you 30% of the said funds. Expecting to hear from you as soon as possible, you can contact me on my direct private email: fabianyadao@yahoo.com and  while replying include your direct mobile phone so I can give you a call immediately for further details.  \r\nATTY.

	{'answer': u"\nIt could have been too soon to pick up on it if you arr pregnant.  Perhaps try in another week or 2 and if nothing talk to your GP. There may be other reasons for the spotting          \nYou could be pregnant because you had unprotected sex the day after your said ovulation day , now you are late for your period and that test was taken way too early for pregnancy to have shown since you took it 11days after ser sex not even 14days. The day immediately after ovulation day(on an ovulation calendar-predicted date not by testing with opk) is one of the days recommended for sex during your fertile window for pregnancy. Normally since you are supposed to test at 1week late after a missed period (since according to lovetoknow.com, testing immediately the day after your missed period has an accurate rate of only 80%), and you tested too early-thats not up to 14days after sex as recommended and still no period, test again in a weeks time if your period doesn't show up. If it still comes back negative and no period, then go for blood test at hospital. That spotting you had on the 28th could be a possible implantation bleeding and you need to give some few days to 1wweek to test so as to allow time for enough hCG production. \n \nIf you are TTC, I have found some good tips in following links, It may be good for you too: \n  \n \n \n \n \nBaby dust to you!!!          \nCheck this out  it helped me when i was trying to get pregnant. I couldnt be any happier that i tried this. A friend of mine suggested it to me after my husband and I struggled for 2 years to get pregnant. We just wanted to start our family and the months drug on and on. The negative pregnancy tests every month stressed us out. We started fighting more, I got depressed everything started falling apart because i couldnt get pregnant. Im so happy that stephanie suggested this. My family is now complete, we have 3 beautiful children thanks to this and our relationship is stronger than ever. I would recommend this to anyone. Good luck in your journey, sending lots of baby dust your way :)          \nYou might be pregnant.          ",

This month On the ovulation calendar it read my last fertile day was on 3/15 but i had unprotected sex the day after (3/16) to 3/19. Now , i was expecting my period on 3/26 but i missed it. I usually have a heavy period the first 3 days of my period. Anyway I missed it, had minor cramps but no flow and on 3/28 i noticed light pink spotting, and only when I wiped. I took a home pregnancy test on the 27th (the day after my missed period) and it came out negative. My nipples feel sore but they always do before my period so not sure if its a pregnancy sign or not. And i also been having headaches here and there. Thats about it. Did I take the test too early? Is there a chance i could possibly be pregnant? Or is the spotting my period? Any thoughts when I should take a test or just wait it out. Thanks for your help!  ',

My Husband flys a lot in fact he just flew into LAX hes good he flys about 1-2 times every month for periods of 7-10 hours each flight both ways, hasn\'t crashed one time :0) you will be fine.           \nI see a commercial airliner take off every three mins from the local airport. Been here several months and none have crashed. \r\n \r\nChances of the plane falling out of the sky are less than being mugged in Dublin.           \nMore people dies every year from car accidents than those who ride on an airplane. But lets improve your idea about airplanes, please tell us what airplane is going to take you to dublin tomorrow. I bet it will be either a A340 or a BOEING 747. What airline is it?          \nThe odds are incredibly low.  You\'re 100 times more likely to die in a car accident on the way to the airport than you are to die in an airplane accident.   \r\n \r\nThere\'s a great book called "Innumeracy" by John Allen Paulos.  He talks about why our society is bad at math (in layman\'s terms - very readable, particularly if you are bad at math).  One of the things he talks about is how the news skews our understaning of odds.  See, on the news, they report unusual events, like plane crashes.  You are going to hear about almost every plane crash that ever happens.  But they don\'t come on the news and say "5000 airplanes took off today, and none of them crashed" - all they report is the once in a blue moon when one does.  This gives you a skewed view that these unusual events happen more often than they really do. \r\n \r\nI\'d encourage you to pick up a copy - maybe read it on the plane.  :-)          \nI\'ll bet the chances of any particular flight being involved in an accident are about like those of your being beaten to death with a frozen porcupine. \r\n \r\nAsk your doctor for a \'tranky\' for the flight and don\'t fly often.          \nPlanes are the safest form of transport by far, the chances of being in a plane crash are 1 in millions and millions. Your life is more at risk walking to the shop.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nJews were regular residents of Germany, like you being a resident of wherever you live. \r\nHitlers cleansing program began with mentally handicapped people, elderly, homosexuals and finally the Jews- you know, exactly what the Christians of the 700 club and followers of Billy graham would do if they could get away with it. \r\nGraham got INTO the white house and influenced policy- we might have been close to killing Jews and homosexuals due to hateful Christians!   \r\nIt all starts in Germany. The concentration camps were in other countries as well.          \nSFAIK Germany did not have a higher percentage of Jews than other European countries.  \r\nIn Europe it was Poland which had a higher than average percentage of Jewish population - which is one of the reasons why most of the nazi extermination camps were located in occupied Poland          \nJews have lived in all European Countries for centuries, not more in Germany than anywhere else. In fact the word "ghetto" comes from the Venetian (not Italian) word "geto", meaning "flow" (of liquid metal). There are still a lot of Jews in Venice and they were a very important part of the financial establishment in the "Serenissima" Republic of Venice, since it was a sin for Christians to lend money for profit.  \r\nThe Jews were the only ones who could lend money and as such they were cherished by every king, ruler or merchant who needed money for whatever enterprise they had in mind. In the 15th century, with the beginning of the Renaissance period, philosophy changed every aspect of human living and banks were born (in Florence). They soon spread all over Europe. At this point the importance of Jewish financiers decreased and the Republic of Venice decided to keep them more under control by concentrating them in a single area. They had recently built a new foundry for their ship building (Arsenal), so the old foundry had become vacant and it was chosen as the appropriate area where to force Jews to live. (Incidentally it is still the area where there is a very high concentration of Jews in Venice today and it is still called "Ghetto degli Ebrei).. \r\nJews were periodically  persecuted in every European Country through the centuries and always for the same reason. When some king or ruler was unable to repay them their loans , he invented some  story about Jews doing something terrible against Christians and heated up popular immagination, which turned against theJews (the most infamous acts against them are the Pogroms of Poland). Hitler did nothing new. After WW1 Germany had a terrible economical crisis and Hitler blamed the Jews for it, implying that the financial slump was due to the hoarding of money perpetrated by the Jews.          \nThere were about 600 000 Jews in Germany in 1933, i.e. less than 1 % of the total German population. Altogether there were about 9.5 million European Jews before the Holocaust and as you probably know, 6 millions of them were killed. Half of them were from Poland, where 10 % of the population was Jewish before the Holocaust.  \r\n \r\nKeep in mind that at the time the Holocaust happened, Germans had occupied a large part of Europe and killed as many Jews as they could in all occupied territories. Most of the Holocaust victims were not from Germany. You cannot understand the Holocaust without knowing about World  War II. \r\n \r\nI also want to correct one more thing in one of the previous answers where it was said that most of the German Jews had been "housed" in concentration camps in Germany, that\'s not true - most of those German Jews who were still in Germany in 1941 when the mass deportations started were deported to Poland to the death camps and ghettos.

	{'answer': u"\nCheck out the ads from your local stores.  They highlight what the best buys are.          \nYeah, love the fresh asparagus best, eggs around Easter and baking products too. Here is a run down \n          \nGosh, you guys make me feel awful.  I do not go and buy things based on the time of year.  All I am really concerned about is what dog food is on sale (for my dogs, not me), and how much Blue Bunny ice cream cost this week! \n \nI love Cadburys cream eggs, so make sure that I always remember Easter. \n \nP.S.  I used to be a REAL mum; made sure that my husband and kids had good nourishing home cooked food.  Now that I am older; husband has died and my kids are living in different places all over the planet, I don't eat properly most of the time. \n \nIt's 9:30am -- definitely ice cream time for me!          \nI will buy turkey in the summer. Many times it costs less than at Thanksgiving. I just watch prices of things. I am an opportunist.          \nHere it's time for the cool season crops. I like carrots, spinach, & yellow chard. It's also a perfect time for a favorite fresh herb, cilantro. I cut up a whole bunch with a pair of scissors & add it by the handful to rice or whatever. A sprig of it can also go in a cheese sandwich, in a hummus sandwich, or in a cucumber & cheese sandwich.  \n \nThere are still a few good sweet potatoes left in the stores & my favorites, avocados. I like an avocado on a grilled cheese or peeled & sliced as a garnish for rice & veggies. Apples are getting a little old, so I mainly eat bananas for my fruit.  \n \nIt's also still cool enough to enjoy oatmeal & raisins in the morning. Later on in the day, it's lentil & veggie soup, either alone, over bread, or stirred into my mac 'n cheese. \n \nIt's also the time to get some great prices on fresh asparagus. I make a great pasta salad with asparagus, frozen peas, & other veggies combined with bow tie pasta, wild rice, sesame oil, & herbs like dried tarragon, rosemary, & oregano.          ",

Thanks for your quote.          \nI agree. You just need to keep moving in life. Life\'s too short to sit and crib about the past or worry about the future.          \nAgree but balance is necessary as well in that we need to rest stop and smell the roses.          \nI like it very much-life is a balancing act, to be sure and if you stop moving, you stop riding on the great wave which is life          \nI like it. It\'s very true. :)          \nIts very true!          \nI agree with Blue. Life IS too short to sit and crib about the past or worry about the future.          \nIt is true.  If One is not moving, then One is planted very deep.          \nI guess he had a point, but didn\'t seem to account for rocks in the road, cracks in the pavement, potholes. \r\n \r\nI think it\'s more like this. Life is like riding a bike, once you fall off you never forget how.          \nTrue when you start sitting around and not challenging \r\nyourself you start to age and not in a good way.          \nVery True \r\nChetak          \nvery true must keep moving indeed so you won\'t loose your path and guidance          \ntruish..but sometimes a rest stop is needed.          \nVery, very true.          \nNot bad.          \nLife is also like riding a horse. If you fall off, pick yourself up and get back on before you become too afraid to try again.  \r\nThat bike one... once you learn how to ride a bike, you never forget.          \nGreat.          \nI love this quote , one of my favorites, and it is very true!          \nI think of Kiblee Ko Biblee          \n" I\'m dancing as fast as I can ! "   I think Einstein was onto something!  inertia is the key!          \nI think to "keep moving" in life is not so much a choice to do or not to do as we seem to be forced along the way from beginning to end. \nI think life is most like a conveyor belt of a specific length.  When born we are placed on the moving belt at the starting end and no matter what we do during our span of existance the belt continues to move at the speed of time as it is on this planet.  No matter what we ever do during our lifetimes our actions never have any effect on that movement like we are being forced along the way.  If we or someone or some force outside us (such as nature) does not perpetrate an act on us so as to cause us to fall off the belt (die) prematurely then we just die as predestined when we fall off the opposite end of the belt as was predestined from the beginning.

	{'answer': u'\nDon\'t risk it, I went on royal Caribbean and had a blast, good food, great prices nice ambiance. I even said it was my honeymoon and they gave me a champagne bottle for my room. DONT spend too much in bigger , more luxurious suites because my wife and I went with the simplest room, with no window! We were like sleeping with the fishes hahaha and had a great great time. anyways most of the time you will hang outside, for the sunsets you really need to go to the upper deck, ASK FOR " MY TIME DINING" which will automatically exclude you from being seated with strangers and you get to have all your dinners in a private table. be careful if you like some of the desserts they will bring them all to you if you weren\'t sure which to pick. The service 6 stars . You will only need a bed in your bedroom and all the money you saved in not going to an expensive suite made it all up for the stops we made in Europe. Congratulations and I almost forgot, you can"t buy spirits in lets say some island and bring it to your room... They will be safekeeping it until the end of the trip and hand it back. You can smuggle a bottle or two in your luggage when coming on board but you will risk it if they find it they will store it for you. Alcoholic beverages are charged. I smuggled a Bellini bottle from Italy and managed not to get caught. CONGRATS, HAVE A BLAST AND MISBEHAVE.          \nRoyal Caribbean is a bit more upscale with slightly softer d\xe9cor colors then Carnival. For romance and class I prefer Princess. They have fewer kids and use soft, neutral colors in their d\xe9cor. They don\'t have water slides, rock climbing walls etc because their customers. don\'t need all those bells and whistles. Quiet elegance and romance is the way I would describe Princess ships          \nOf those three, I\'d go with Carnival - definitely not NCL.  If you want peace and quiet in a beautiful setting, try Celebrity.  They don\'t cruise in the Caribbean in the Summer, however.  Those other three lines will be loaded with kids [and adults acting like children, sometimes].  The decor on Carnival is definitely over-the-top - think Vegas on steroids!  But, if that doesn\'t bother you, it\'s a good line for a first cruise, as the value is very good. \n \nGo over to CruiseCritic.com, click on "Community", then "Message Boards", and then browse through the boards for those cruise lines and you\'ll get a feel for the different cruise lines.          \nCarnival is like shopping at Walmart. Same people. Royal Caribbean is a little more upscale, with a better crowd, and entertainment.          \nI\'ve done 7 cruises, 4 Celebrity, and one each on NCL, RCCL, and Carnival.  The NCL was my least favorite. The food was mediocre, the quality of service was poor, and the most annoying part, the drink servers were worse than the vendors on a third world country beach.  I would have 3 hit me up in a span of 5 minutes.  Very annoying. \nCarnival was better than I expected. It was the cheapest cruise we\'ve done.  I\'m a bit of a snob, and didn\'t like the passengers much.  Lots of rednecks and people who had never been more than 10 miles from home.  I actually heard one complaining about all the foreigners at the ports.   \nI like Celebrity. The passengers tend to be more international, the food is fantastic, and the service is very good.  It\'s a tad pricier than the other mainstream lines. \nIf you are younger, I would go RCCL of the three you mentioned.          \nI\'m a Carnival regular but if this is a one shot deal for you check out where the port stops are and the prices and take everything into consideration including the cost to get to the ship. I\'m in California so air fare to take a Caribbean cruise about doubles the cost over a Mexico cruise.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    We\'re planning a cruise in June for our honeymoon and want to go to the Eastern Caribbean (from Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Port Canaveral, or Miami) and it seems like Carnival\'s prices are quite a bit less than the other cruise lines.  I\'ve heard some people say there\'s not much difference, but I have seen Carnival in the news much more with major problems! \n \nAny advice or information from seasoned "cruisers" would be much appreciated!

	{'answer': u"\nIt sounds like your trying to make something out of nothing. Don't worry about your husband. He's probably in th up and up.          \nI think you're fine. If your husband was hiding something then he wouldn't have told you they were talking on the plane at all. That's how I see it. Also, he mentioned he wasn't happy in his last relationship and that he's much happier with you. If he wanted something to happen with this lady, he could have acted like something was wrong in his marriage as well. You follow me? :)          \nI don't think you have anything to worry about yet.  He didn't say anything flirty or sexual or romantic to this woman.  If he did, that's when you would need to worry.  The fact that he tried to delete some of the emails is a little disconcerting but I wouldn't get too worried yet.          ",
	 'question': u"\n    I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 1/2 years. I am 30 and he is 43. He travels a lot with his job and is usually in another country at least a week out of the month.  \r\n \r\nHe's a very social person and has friends in cities that he frequently visits (London, Tokyo, etc.) Part of his job is to take people he does business with out to dinners and out for drinks. So he is often out taking part in the cities nightlife. He has friends that are women in these cities and he tells me about spending time with them when he spends time with them.  \r\n \r\nThis summer he met a woman on a trip to Europe. She lives in another state and travels as well with business. He sat next to her on the first flight and then on the flight back by pure coincidence they were on the same flight. He has access to the frequent flier lounge area for American Airlines as he travels so much and on the way back he said he got her into the lounge with him and they had long conversations on both flights. He said that she confided in him that she was having marital problems and because he has been through a divorce in the past he was offering her advice.  \r\n \r\nAbout 2 months ago my boyfriend and I were out at a concert and I held on to his phone for him in my purse. I was a little tipsy so I read his phone text messages. This is something I had never done before because I always trusted him but I did it and he saw me doing it (although I pretended at the time like I hadn't and we never addressed it). On his phone were many text messages back and forth with this woman where he was offering her advice on her marriage and she was confiding in him. About a week after the concert he shared with me that this woman he had met on a flight was telling him about all her marital problems.  \r\n \r\nThe text messages never read like there was anything going on between them and in fact if I can remember correctly he was telling her to try and save her marriage but that he couldn't make it work with his ex wife and that he was much happier now in his current relationship (with me).  \r\n \r\nBut ever since seeing the text messages I have felt jealous (which I never ever was before). I checked his facebook about a month ago (I know its wrong) and he had a facebook message from the woman he met on the plane. It was pretty innocent ... he was just telling her he was in such and such country and asked how things were at home and she replied saying that things were much better at home and that they should coordinate their trips one of these times. He had also texted her around the same time and said he was in this great wine bar in London and that they should go sometime.  \r\n \r\nThe other day he had left himself logged in on facebook and I noticed that he had archived the email thread so it didn't show up in his inbox. He is not totally facebook savvy and didn't realize that archiving doesn't delete the email but puts it in a special archived section of the email. I checked his archived messages and that was the only one in it. I fessed up that I had seen his facebook email and that I noticed when he was checking his emails that there was an email from her but now he had deleted it. I know that they hadn't said anything indicating an affair but I wonder why he deleted it?? It just seemed weird that he had deleted it. He then told me that there was a bunch of stuff about her marriage in the email and he just didn't want to leave it in his inbox. I knew that wasn't true (and that it was just the 2 messages I mentioned previously) but I didn't want to press the issue. He also said that he wouldn't cheat on me because he loved me and didn't want to mess that up. He said that this woman was very nice and they got along well and that if they were ever in the same city he probably would go to dinner or lunch with her just as friends. I said that she was attractive and he agreed that she was pretty but that he wasn't attracted to her in that way. He also said that occasionally he does flirt with women that he knows or meets but that he would never take it beyond flirting. He said that he wouldn't care if I flirted with men as long as I didn't take it further then that either. \r\n \r\nDo you think I have anything to be concerned about?? Am I just building something up in my mind. I've never been jealous or concerned with this until now.  ",

(I mean different like different background or something).  This dream also so real and so vivid that I was able to pinch myself, and sat up woke up scared.  I layed back down.  Had a third dream.  This dream also had a different backdrop but just as the other two what was the same was that I had a pregnancy test and it came out postive.  This dream was also so real I could pinch myself and I sat straight up scared!  All this happened exactly 14 days after the first day of my last peroid!  Two or three weeks later as I sat talking to my mom, and I was only like a week late, she bought me a pregnancy test, and it read postive within like 1 second after finishing it!   \r\n \r\nMy daughter that came as a result of January 14, 1997 is now 10 years old and in the 4th grade.

	{'answer': u"\nI heard Royal Caribbean is top of the line. \r\nWe did a Carnival Cruise this year- it wasn't bad but the rooms were very small and the entertainment was boring.          \nOf the 3 RCL, but you could always go Princess too which is very good. Just stay from Holland unless you are 60+          \nJust to let you know of the 3 cruise lines you've listed. Carnival has the largest inside / oceanview cabins in square feet. \r\n \r\nFor the price, Carnival can't be beat. The food really good, I've been on several different Carnival ships and have never had a problem with the food, other than the burger grill being closed at 3am when I got the munchies.          \nCarnival was our first cruise and it was fantastic. BUT IT WAS OUR FIRST, therefore it will always be the best. Second was Norwegian, and we hated it. Now we travel Royal Caribbean (12 cruises)usually on the Radiance. Many of the crew now call us by our first names and they truely make us part of their family. \r\nHope this helped          \nNCL  (Norwegian) is best for non formal cruises. Royal Caribbean and Carnival  tend to be more up market. But all 3 are good  \r\nCheck out the Royal Caribbean and Carnival reviews before you book. \r\nwww.cruise2010.net          \nYou'll get all of that on all 3 cruise lines. \r\n \r\nWhat else is your criteria for choosing? \r\n \r\nIf you are price sensitive, go with Carnival as its typically cheaper. \r\nIf you don't want to dress up for formal dinners or hv a set dinner time, go with Norwegian (freestyle cruising) \r\nIf a rock climbing wall or surf rider on the ship sounds fun, go with Royal Caribbean. \r\n \r\nFaraz \r\nhttp://MeetOnCruise.com          \nI think you should DEFINITELY go on Royal caribean. I have been on  it 7 times and all the times i absolutely loved it. You should try one going to the  panama canal. its so fun. You will never i mean never get bored. i have tryed norweigan and carnival and princess they were not as good          \nRoyal Caribbean. I have been on 5 Royal Caribbean cruises, all have been amazing. Their new ship The Oasis of the Seas is the best cruise ship in the world. If its only 4 days then I am guessing it's to the Bahamas. Most of the ships that go there aren't the top of the line. Just look and see what you like the best. I have gone on Princess cruises and they have also been very good. I however refuse to go on Norwegian. To me they are to cheezy and touristy, I think they are too relaxed.          \nDO NOT go one norwegian. it so terrible! either royal caribbean or carnival. it all depends on what your looking for. carnival is a major party cruise, and RC is more relaxing, but also has a lot more fun stuff. like on RC theres ice skating basetball surfing rockwall and a ton more. and on carnival theres like a water slide and thats about it. from personal experience i like RC a lot better. the rooms were very nice and comfortable, and the food was very good !          \nRoyal Carri bean! I hate been on carnival 4 times, Norwegian 3 times, and Royal Caribbean 9 because I loved it sooo much! The kids program is GREAT! Also, they have many fun activities! Such as the flow rider (a surf simulator), rock climbing wall, AN ICE RINK!, put put, karaoke, and MUCH MUCH MUCH more! I just went on the Oasis, their biggest cruise ship, oh it was SPLENDID! The staff is over the top as well!          \nIn order of my preference: \r\n1.  Norwegian - very nice \r\n2.  Royal Caribbean - Oasis of the Seas = yummy \r\n3.

	{'answer': u'\nIt is the same way in the town I live in, USA. The small mall is almost empty now and if anyone wants to buy fabric, you have to drive at least 45 minutes to get to a fabric store!  \r\n \r\nActually, all of this occurred when the giant Walmart moved in and undercut all the Mom and Pop stores ran by locals. They could not compete and lost too many customers to the industry giant.  \r\n \r\nI miss the older shops and as a result of my feelings, I do NOT shop Walmart!          \nOh, Gerry, you are so right. In my communty, in the early 1990s, I started a little community newspaper. It was free to readers, because area merchants bought enough ads that their payments covered the printing of the paper. After a few years, I moved to another state. Then I came back here three years ago. I thought of starting the paper again -- but when I looked at the business district, all hope was gone. Most of the shops were empty. There were entire blocks of empty stores which once were filled with businesses. The big bank building, with its greek columns, is empty and for sale. The little church across the street from my house is empty and for sale. It is so depressing to see a commnity _dead_that was once alive. This is due partly to the recession, and partly to the fact that the industries that once powered this area have left -- to other countries. So sad, so sad. I\'m really sorry to hear that your community is equally afflicted. I thought these things happened only in the US. What is happening with our world, do you think? The answer is surely beyond me.          \nA business won\'t make it if there isn\'t a great demand for it here now. More people have become smart shoppers and fewer are using credit cards for their purchases, a hardware store on this side of town closed down, it was too close to Walmart, and for special items it is well-worth the trip to the other side of town to the big home stores.  On the other hand, thrift and resale stores are doing quite well. People are no longer shy about saying that they got a bargain at such places.          \nYes, there are lots of empty shops and sadly more houses for sale than I have ever seen.  A good deal of jobs are going to China and Mexico.  I don\'t know how these companies expect people to buy their goods when people here are losing their jobs.          \nYes. Walmart has killed the downtown area. Companies that were around since I was a child have gone out of business. It\'s sad. All towns seem to be doomed to become alike. McDonald\'s, etc.          \nMy husband, the two Yorkies and I recently made an RV trip to the New England area. We spent a week in a small town in New Hampshire where some old friends now live. I was amazed and thrilled at the many small towns, with a village that had shops, not department stores and absolutely no Wal Marts. Of course there were department stores and mega Wal Marts within driving distance, but there was one particular route that just rambled in and out of small towns with villages at their center. I was born and raised in the south and know I could never acclimate myself to the cold winters, but when I win the lottery you can bet I\'ll have a summer home in one of those New Hampshire small towns.          \nClosed and shuttered shops of every description, are becoming alarming evident in our smaller towns and rural villages. Charity shops are out numbering those businesses which still open their doors.  \r\n \r\nThe poor suffer the most, and maybe the pensioners get a lot of the blunt. This morning\'s TV is saying more vital cuts in the care of the elderly. Which frightens me very much. I am a pensioner and think that my worth has expired and I am just a burden on society.  \r\n \r\nAnd Governments take the easy way out of a recession by cutting benefits and threaten those who cannot fight back.  \r\n \r\nHave you ever seen the Governments create jobs for the long term indigenous (English born) and give preference to foreign and non-English persons in the job market. Multiculturalism and Integration isn\'t working in my opinion.  \r\n \r\nI have always felt isolated and alienated and never really understood the next door foreigner. In yesterday\'s news Germany\'s lady Prime minister was saying about multiculturalism not working with the Muslims named but one. \r\n \r\nAlso the employers of this country should be made aware of their responsibilities in re-training and doing more for the long term unemployed. Whole estates of unemployed and never had a job and never likely to have one again. Truly scandalous, and they say the unemployed are workshy.  \r\nBecause it is the easy way to address the problem.  \r\n  \r\ngivemestrength          \nWhen we were living in Las Vegas, some small shops did close down. Stores such as small pet shops and a few small hair salons,perhaps more but I didn\'t notice. It was more like large shopping centers being built but no tentants in the shops. Sort of like jobs for some construction workers with all the new buildings but no one to move into the shops once they were built. \r\nThere is over 14% unemployment in NV and really it\'s probably higher then 20% if you consider the part-time jobs and the jobs lost and not ever coming back. \r\nHere in Hungary, one of the large pastry  shops, it was over 90 years in business has closed down. There are several small shops empty on the main blvd. off of our apt.house. Seems many new small bakeries around town, mostly just selling bread and rolls, the one that closed was a fancy sit down shop. There is alot of corruption here in Hungary that is over looked by the locals since I suppose they are used to it having lived under communist rule for so long. With fresh eyes from the US, we are rather sick seeing how things go over here. People open businesses here with the plan to close down before they have to pay taxes to the government. The government is thinking of putting a new law on the books that if you lose 3 businsses in your lifetime, you are not allowed to open up a 4th one. People will get around that law though, they will just open under someone else\'s name. \r\nWe used to go swimming here at a small spa that cost about $6. a person for the day. Not super cheap for many people but it was a nice place to spend the day, in the 2 years we have been gone from Hungary, the cost of that spa has risen to over $12. a person. Don\'t know what they are thinking here, most workers only make about $25. a day, how do they expect the locals to use the spa? Seems it is a two class system over here, rich a poor. I hate to see anything like this happen in the US. \r\nNews here is that the former PM by face corruption charges soon, hopethen actually do something with him, he was outrageous with the insane deals he pulled to fill his pockets.Of course he isn\'t alone, heads should roll here.          \nNot too many. But the funny thing about this is that I\'m always hearing about how bad this ressesion is, and how many people there are out of work and without money, but when I walk into either Walmart or the mall, or go to a Mcdonalds or a Burger King on either a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, there\'s always an astrnomically big crowd and the waiting time to get through a register at any of these places becomes longer and longer with each passing week. Not to mention the traffic on the road getting there and back. Go figure.          \nWhat a shame. My son just went back to England as he was bought up there and held england close to his heart and he said Mum I don\'t want to go back there to live now. I live in Australia and no our shops are doing well here          \nI live in a military area, it gives us some economic stability.  We haven\'t had too many closures here, mostly restraunts.          \nEast Kilbride has the largest undercover shopping centre in Scotland made up of 6 malls. \r\n          \nOur town doesn\'t have a High Street shopping area but an indoor mall.  There are as many closed shops as there are open shops. \r\nThere seems to be more \'cheap\' shops than anything else - Poundstetcher type shops, cheap toiletries and greeting card shops.  As you say - as sign of the times.  I still miss Woolies though.          \nMy local city, Norwich, is looking ok at the moment but as you say one or two more charity shops replacing where there used to be specialised stores and of course good old Woollies. \r\nThe local towns are little more sparsely catered for now as we have lost an excellent butcher (I really miss him) and  a gift/stationers shop to be replaced with a mini Sainsburys, still it\'s better they are replaced than seeing bordered up, sad looking buildings and turning into a ghost town.          \nYes, For Lease signs, even for existing thrift stores.  Day laborers gathered on sidewalks early mornings, mostly Mexican.  Cash for Gold signs in front of pawn shops.  Cars and trucks for sale on private lots, even buses.  Signs of the times, indeed.          \nThere are several shops with "to lease" signs in the windows.  I do not blame the problem on the local Walmart that is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  They are making an effort to serve their customers.  The locally owned shops in town rarely open before 10:30 in the morning and are closed promptly at five o\'clock in the afternoon.  One never knows for sure which stores are open on which days.  Most are closed on Mondays. \r\n \r\nI prefer to shop in small local stores, but they do not make it easy.  It is hard to understand why a merchant would not open the doors for business when customers want to buy things.  If they are paying rent and utilities and maintaining inventory, why not open the doors and do business?  They will actually stand inside their shops, keys in hand, and watch customers stand outside in the cold until the precise opening time before opening their doors.  Absurd!   If you are lucky enough to find a store open, there is no guarantee that the owner or employee will make any effort to help you find what you want.  Their response to a query is often less than helpful. \r\n \r\nShops are closing down because they are not being run well.  The ones that cater to the needs of their customers are thriving.          \nYes, thanks to Walmart....and then they pulled out and we had nothing!! The population of where I live is about 4,000 with many small towns close by!! We eventually got an Alco which is Walmarts seconds!!  We now have Dollar General and Family Dollar stores and their prices beat the big Walmart stores!!          \nA lot of it is the town\'s fault, knowing the economy is as it is.  If they really wanted to keep businesses on main street, they should promote their own and help business owners by finding "mentors" who have business savvy.  Those who own the property could give incentives by giving a break in rent.  The store owners could also all stay open until 9 one night a week...it would bring people in as a community. \r\n \r\nI live amongst many small towns in a rural community.  There are some who work together as a community and really promote their town and others that are nothing but a Post Office. It\'s up to each and every one of us, whether we want to continue our small communities or blow away in the wind.          \nI live in Michigan so it goes without saying that there are many, many businesses closed.  Michigan has been one of the hardest hit states in the US because of the auto industry.  It\'s not just the shops as in manufacturing.  Because of those closing smaller businesses have closed, too and support businesses like grocery stores, etc.          \nWe have two shops in the village near me (3 miles away) .If we need to do a big shop we have either a 40 mile journey or,a super shop,100 miles.No shops seem to be closing.          \nOur town centre & Serpentine Green shopping areas seems to be faring quite well. We are getting TK Maxx (would have prefered a Primark)move into the old Woolies store in the town centre. However one of the older shopping area`s has become very run down with Eastern European shops, cafes and fast food outlets.......In fact it`s become a dump.          \nIt seems like every week a few more "thrift shops" are opening in areas that use to be really nice shops.Most of my favorite ones are now closed and I use the internet to try and find thing I use to buy but cant find in the shops that are still open now.          \nI miss walking up and down the main street of my home town. We had shops on both sides of the street and two hotels. A large train station was at the end of the street and at the other end we had, (still do) a market house with a large clock on all four sides. City buses ran every half hour. There were restaurants and soda shops. Now Main street is empty and one of the hotels has been torn down. My father would sit on main street in his car, smoking his cigarettes and drinking a Coke every Saturday while mother and my siblings shopped. My grandchildren have missed so much of that lost era.  Poppy          \nSame in central Scotland where I am. Loads of \xa3 shops opening and we all say "Oh no! wish we could get some decent shops" but the thing is we all use them. Lets face it, just one example why would you buy Flash Kitchen Cleaner at \xa31.95 at your supermaket when you can get it in the \xa3 shop or as in at the moment at Wilkinsons or Home Bargains even cheaper???  I was just thinking the other day that how much less I spend in the big supermarkets as a year or two ago. It must be effecting these \'big boys\' as Aldi, Lidil, Home Bargains etc. are doing often the same or similar quality products so much cheaper.          \nWhat gets me cross is the way that local councils moan about the death of the town centres and then allow the shops to move to more modern premises on the outskirts. Many of the shops close down because these councils up the rents and rates making it impossible for the shop to make a profit. At this time of the year I love going to the old towns where the Christmas theme is far more in keeping with the season.          \nSo far - in my distant surrounding areas,  there have been few small shops closing but a number of large department stores & supermarket chains have closed locations which have been devastating for the neighborhoods & the employees.  Most locally to my neighborhood, nothing has changed dramatically - thus far.  The California economy is in flux and there will be areas about the entire state which will have entire business districts close do to lack of business due to the unemployment of their population.  It will be some time before CA will be in recovery since our plight is just beginning to erupt.          \nIn my town Rye east sussex just 1, but in the large town of Hastings lots and lots ,          \nAlas, Gerry my home town seems to be the same as yours. We have a proliferation of pound shops and charity shops. Many old established businesses have now gone leaving empty shops which add to the air of decay.          \nNot in the small town where I live now.  There are only a dozen or less, of small shops anyway, each of them pretty important to the residents here.  We all go into the city for other things. \r\n \r\nThe city near us has had quite a few closings.  However, there seem to be other new little shops opening all the time, as well.  Progress, I suppose.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nI am so sorry all the bakery\'s and dairy\'s are gone, making it a true supermarket world.  Here in Southern Indiana          \nit\'s 50 miles to the store from where i live so i just buy it all at the supermarket and get it don e and over with.  And i only go about once a month so i have to buy enough to last me.   also have to hurry home in the Texas heat so that it doesn\'t spoil before i get home!  so it\'s a hundred round trip to the grocery store for me!          \nMost everything we buy comes from either the local chain market, Costco or Trader Joe\'s.  Some exceptions:  I buy fresh warm bagettes at the vietnamese bakery/sandwich shop. I buy lamb & olives at the ethnic market. I get my fresh fish from the fish monger at the ethnic markets.          \nUnfortunately, supermarkets or chains of warehouses such as Costco will inevitably put such small shops out of business. That is capitalism.          \nI\'m not a senior but where I live there are still bakeries and butcher shops, contrary to what the others are saying.          \ni am 35  and buy my meat at a butcher and my milk is deliverer  \r\nyour qs isn\'t insulting at all! SOME ONE IS HAVING A HEAT FLASH  i grow my veggies too and we hunt \r\ni make my own bread \r\nand i have 2 kids ages 27 months and 5 months \r\nbusy woman          \nSure do. 1 block away with all of those in one.  Mt. Shasta. Ca.          \nIm not a senior but I would do it old style if I could.The distance to drive for each individual store would be a big time gas and money waster so it doesn\'t make much sense to do it this way.My city used to have all of these types of specialty stores,several of them.The big box types came in and they went away.Its sad really but who can stop progress.Things change,some for the better and some for the worse.In this case I think its for the worse,its made my little city lose its identity a little and kind of stopped neighbors from interacting,that\'s sad to me.          \nMy milk and eggs come from my own animals. My meat is predominantly from off the ranch and in my freezer. We tend a small garden in the spring usually and usually also in the fall. The Winter Garden District which is a large truck crop area in Texas is just east of us and when veggies are being processed you can fill your freezer if you want to go to the trouble, which we do. Our local mercantile supplies us with most of the items that we don\'t gather and or butcher ourselves. We take animals to the slaughter house where it is cut and wrapped, ready for the freezer. I love fried cottontail and that I shoot right down the road from the house usually. I enjoy going to the big super markets in the big city and I marvel at the wide array of food from all over the world that people can choose from. We do live in a remarkable time in history. Seafood,  which I love is available at the large supermarkets and we sometimes buy in bulk and freeze it but usually we just buy for today\'s need and do with that.          \nOur city and immediate area has butcher shops but , although the meat cuts are very good, they are also pretty expensive. My area used to have a number of dairies but that started going away about in the mid to late 60\'s. \r\n \r\nOccasionally, at this time of year, we have small farmers markets in our downtown area but there are no green grocers for year around produce. \r\n \r\nStill have several bakeries but the days of a nickle donut are gone. I am glad I was alive to see most of those things and, since my dad was a rural mail carrier, got to get plenty of fresh farm products. Actually had hog and beef farms on his route as well as a honey farm and a dairy. Used to get the real deal where the cream would separate over night and the first kid to get cereal took the cream( till mom and dad caught us) \r\n \r\nNow, the only fresh cuts or produce I get is from my own butchering or my garden or as second best, from my canning efforts. \r\n \r\nI think it was a great question and brings back a lot of memories. Thanks for the little trip down the memory lane.          \nNone of those exist around here anymore.   The farmers markets are almost done now with the change of weather coming.          \nOh, how I wish I still could get that fresh from the cow milk & that newly butchered beef from a slab hanging in the butcher shop window.  I loved the way those places smelled.  I can still remember the sights, sounds & smells of all those places...especially the bakery! \r\n \r\nIn my area, I\'d have to travel far & wide to find these "specialty shops" & then figure out a way to get to them home without them spoiling in the hot summer months! \r\n \r\nIt\'s not less expensive for me to use the local markets when I factor in the travel time, cost of gas & waste from spoiled food!  Besides, I no longer eat meat daily or drink cow\'s milk!  I\'m lucky to live where we have access to fresh local produce at a decent price.  A large part of my daily diet is fruits & veggies...sans chicken 3x a week!          \nWe don\'t have the benefit of the old fashion way.          \nI wished we still did. \r\nWe usually buy them at Walmarts or Hyvee in the KC area. \r\nBut I can relate to the old days when going shopping back home with my parents and grand parents.          \nWe do our shopping at a major supermarket. The veggies we try to buy locally grown at those veggie stands. We don\'t really drink milk, at least I don\'t and I won\'t. And as for meats, we are trying to cut back our consumption of meats. Working on going more vegetarian. But not all vegetarian. Can\'t give up on bacon with eggs for breakfast.          \nDairy is too far for milk, but we do go there for our fresh cheese a couple of times a year. A local dairy closed last fall, the cows are gone and the farm has been sold for a housing development. \r\nButcher - one nearby but dont go. I am not sure why... \r\nBakery - yes, very nearby, go there for holiday breads and bakery, as well as anytime I want \'good\' bread, maybe once a month. We have cut way down on eating those items. \r\nProduce - many produce markets and stands around us and we frequent them often. We prefer to support our local growers. Things get scarce in the winter thought. \r\nAlso, we have many local small wineries around us and we frequent them too. :) \r\n \r\nThis is a good question, thanks for asking it. \r\n \r\nI wash some things by hand every week, and have been known to "rinse out a blouse" every now and then. Hands and knees for the floor only once in a while, I usually try to use my old cotton mop.          \nThere has been only one time in my life when I shopped the old fashioned way. I lived in Australia for a while and I loved getting to know the butchers, bakers and grocers. I guess I could get my groceries that way but the inconvenience, not to mention the gasoline involved, make it too impractical.          \nI wish I could shop like that I miss it very much. We do have a good butcher shop here and a few good bakeries left but the markets are making it harder and harder for them to compete with. We have fresh produce stands in the summer and I use them and they are cheaper than the market. I really resent not having the choices we use to have. I know I am showing my age but when my kids were young we had a milk man. He delivered the milk and brought it right into the kitchen and put it into my firg for me. He also delivered anything dairy along with bacon and eggs. The kids are all grown and gone now so I really don\'t need a milk man but I remember when the snow would get so bad that I couldn\'t get out to buy groceries and I could make a great meal with the things I got from the milk man. I hate supermarkets and I hate malls. I try very hard not to shop in either of them. Shopping is so boring today and so few choices. It is really sad. I love it when I go to Italy or France and they have so many shops to chose from and especially bakeries. I miss that the most. Your lucky you still have those little shops you can go to. I envy you.          \nhow can we when all the corner shops are gone          \nWhen & where I can- no local dairy (even in WI!) but several cheese stores.  A fantastic bakery is only a mile or so.  No meat market but a couple of sausage speciality stores nearby.  I\'d kill for a good fish monger, all I can get is either frozen or in the seafood section pretending to be fresh.  99% of which comes in the back door frozen.  Summer is great when I can go to the local farmers market.          \nHere in the US I go to a supermarket, there are only a few stand-alone bakeries left around here, a butcher on the other side of town, the only stores considered a dairy store would be Braum\'s which also a restaurant/ice cream place. Haven\'t seen a produce stand except the local farmer\'s market which is open a few months through the year, half of the stuff comes from out of state there and is resold. I like to go to ethnic markets, a large Asian market is my favorite, carry spices, noodles, green teas and other things I use, usually don\'t leave without at least $30 or more in stuff each time. \r\n \r\nWhile in Morocco most grocery shopping was done at separate markets in the bazaar, butchers, bakery for breads, sweet shop for cakes and cookies, beans and pasta is at a separate stand, spices and dry herbs at another, and fresh herbs and mints at yet another and green grocers for produce. There are a few large supermarkets but they are miles away from most people and not convenient. And tiny little stores called "hanuts" that carry a little bit of all necessities, very convenient to buy from them to make dinner or get a snack, they don\'t charge as much as the large supermarkets either.  It\'s a pleasant diversion to walk around each evening and buy the necessities and browse at all the other little stalls too.          \nI buy everything but my meat at Super Walmart 6O miles away in the city.  I buy my meats from a little meat market that sells only freezer packages.  I always buy the 50 lb mixed package which is chicken, beef, pork, sausages(sometimes beef & sometimes pork) and bacon for $125.   AND sometimes he gives me a package of venison steaks that wasn\'t picked up by the person who had a deer processed.  I only shop once a month.  I\'m sure there are bakeries and fruit/vegetables stands somewhere in or around the city but I haven\'t lived in this area long enough to know my way around very well.  The city is big and I get lost easily.  The little town I live in (pop 836)only has one convenience store/service station and a church on every corner.  LOL.          \nI shop in a small home town grocery store.  We have a meat counter where it is wrapped up right in front of you.  No bakery in town just the grocery store with its bread isle.  I could go to a super market down the road about 30 miles, but I prefer to stay in town.   \r\n \r\nWe know each other and visit while shopping.  The carry out boy knows my car and he makes sure I don\'t have to lift a finger.          \nIt\'s pretty much the supermarket in my hometown.  Although there are some great bakeries, most of them just sell pastries and have stopped selling fresh bread. There are a few good fish markets, and I do buy there frequently. But there\'s not a butcher shop that i know of, and there are only locally grown vegetables at a couple of farmer\'s markets and roadside stands during growing season.  \r\n \r\nI visit NYC about 3-4 times a year and I love the fact that there are still specialty stores like you talk about there.  There aren\'t many left, but the ones that are do a great business.  The fish markets are particularly interesting since they have many things that I can\'t find in my city.  I also love the cheese stores, and the bakeries are just out of this world.          \nThe "progress" of big box stores and giant super markets drove nearly all of those specialty stores out of existence here in my corner of Northwest Ohio.  I still buy my produce, whenever possible, at Farmers\' and flea markets.          \nThese "specialty shops" are fast disappearing from the society and we are less ABLE to shop there for our groceries. \r\n \r\nWe have a butcher and I do shop there occasionally, but the prices are higher and I cannot afford the meat there on a regular basis.  I only use them for cuts that I\'m unable to find at the supermarket. \r\n \r\nDairies around here do not sell to private individuals. \r\n \r\nThe bakeries are commercial bakeries.  I can only think of ONE bakery in town, and they sell mostly "specialty" items.  And, again, prices are not favorable to my budget. \r\n \r\nIn the summer, I do check out local produce stands, but they are further and farther between than ever before, and their selections are less varied than what is available at the supermarket.  There are Farmers Markets, but the days/hours are not conducive to when I\'m able to shop.  And, once again, the prices are not always competitive with the supermarket. \r\n \r\nFor these reasons, the supermarket is the best choice for price, availability, convenience, and variety. \r\n \r\n \r\nHave a Seasoned day.          \nNo, though sometimes I go to the Farmer\'s Market.  Our Farmer\'s Market is open year-round, even in the rainy season.   \r\nI go most often to the health food store which is right next to the campus where I work & close to home, too, & it offers a senior discount 3 days/wk.  I also go to a small neighborhood store, but mainly for specials on local produce & an occasional splurge on a ready-made casserole or something like that.  Both of these stores have the local brand of milk, which is all I\'ll buy.  I like the juice blends, good for whatever ails you, at both stores.  The great thing about these small stores is that it\'s in & out fairly quickly. \r\n \r\nI also get a few things, such as bargains on tea bags, at Trader Joe\'s.  In Aug they had some good buys on the big containers of blueberries, so a bowl of blueberries with sliced banana was a routine luxury for awhile.  I also have fun at their sample bar. What a pig, going back to sneak seconds at the sample bar, especially if I haven\'t eaten yet  Tch, tch, tch. \r\n \r\nSometimes I go to Safeway.  They have a pretty good price on their organic oj.  For awhile I was hooked on their jalapeno foccacio (a big chunk of bread for about 70 cents that is practically a meal in itself, heated at home or at work in the microwave), but decided they were too salty & probably high in fat, no good for blood pressure & cholesterol tests that doctors seem to want us to take all the time when we\'re seniors, even those of us who are thin.  What a drag! \r\n \r\nLife was simpler when I just shopped at one store once a week no matter what.  Life was also simpler when we didn\'t have to worry about salt & fat.   \r\n \r\nBon appetit!          \nI live near a town small enough to have one grocery store.  The next closest one is 45 minutes away.  The big city is an hour and 15 minutes away.   \r\n \r\nI like the meat at the local store and I shop there for emergencies and whatever I forgot during our monthly trip to the big city.  I grow most of our vegetables.  We pretty much eat what\'s in season and I do freeze a few things.          \nNo it\'s the Supermarket. In the summer we do go to the Farmer\'s market and get fresh vegetables, fruits, baked good, sorghum, breads . \r\nFriends and neighbors also contribute fresh products.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nI'm going on the Carnival cruise in about a month. It was a lot cheaper and a lot of friends & family reccomended it. I've also heard Royal Carribean was awesome but, more pricey. I never heard of the other one.          \nI have been to both Bahamas and Caribbean a few times and the Bahamas by far is nicer. ROYAL CARIBBEAN is going to be a much better experience for you. I've been on several curse lines and Royal has the most fun crew member, plenty of activites (the quest is one you should not miss) and their food is the best out of all the cruise lines! Plus they have private islands, like Cocoa Kay... Royal may cost a bit more but it is well worth it. Trust me, I am all about saving money and bargain shopping and getting the most out of a vacation. If you go with Roay Caribbean you wiill not be disappointed but if you go with one of the others, you might not get what you are hoping for. Spend the extra and sail on the best cruise line..          \nCarnival & Royal are more family cruises so you most likely will have lots of kids running around. For you 1st year anniversary as husband and wife you might want a more sophisticated cruise but still have lots of activities for you to do, for that reason i would say NCL (Norwegian) could be your cruise line. Have a look at their cruises, facilities and entertainment they have and see if its for you.          \nThe Bahamas and the Caribbean are both great places. But there's more to see in the Caribbean. I prefer Carmival over both of the other cruise lines. I've been on 6 Carnival, 1 Royal and 1 Norwegian. Carnival has a friendlier staff versus RCL's snobby and rude staff. Norwegian is a whole other story. My family will never cruise with them again. If you guys want to just party all cruise long, then definately Carnival, but if you want something more classy chose Royal. I'm going on Carmival Dream this summer to the Bahamas and Caribbean          \nI prefer the Caribbean and if you can afford it, RCCL.  Carnival is a decent cruise line as well \r\n \r\nIf you do go to the Bahamas - try to find an itinerary that avoids Freeport          \nIve been on 2 Carnival and 1 Royal Caribbean, and RC was better by far. It was also a 7 day cruise which I think helped. The buffet food on RC was much better than Carnival and the dining room food just slightly better. RC had better entertainment and more things to do on board also, and didn't seem so crowded. Carnival was more of a drunk college kids party on the last one I did (made the mistake of going during spring break) and was very disappointing. \r\n \r\nIf you have never been to the Bahamas, Nassau is really nice and Freeport not so much. Both cruise lines have a private island in the Bahamas which should be nice also, but its more just a beach break type of stop. No history or sight seeing or anything like that.  \r\n \r\nI prefer the caribbean just because there are more places you can chose from. Western isn't too bad but they ALWAYS seem to stop in Cozumel, which is OK if you have never been there before. And the Eastern you have the Virgin Islands and others that are very nice also. \r\n \r\nGiven the choices, I would chose Royal Caribbean to the Bahamas though.          \nMy opinion is: \r\n \r\n1. Royal Caribbean \r\n2. Carnival \r\n3. Norwegian \r\n \r\nThat said, don't pay a huge premium for a Royal Caribbean cruise over a Carnival.  Its not so much better as to warrant paying a great deal more.  But if the prices are comparable - take the Royal.          ",

If you've been to both the Bahamas and the Caribbean, which one did you prefer? What are the best ports to stop at? I'm 24 and my husband is 27 and we haven't been on a cruise before, we would want plenty of options for activities and entertainment.  ",

	{'answer': u'\nNo, I do not think leaving 15% tip is an insult. You want to leave between 15% and 20%. I would not go any lower than 15% unless the waiter/waitress was terrible. Very rarely I will go above 20%, but like I said very rarely do I ever do that.          \n15% is an average tip I give for average service.  I have given as much as 25% for exceptional service and I have given as low as two cents for poor service (just to make sure the server didn\'t think I forgot the tip).          \nIf they think so, tough! That\'s what they\'re getting. If there was a lot of work involved and the service was excellent, 20% or a little more. I\'ve known a few waiters and waitresses. They have all bucked for 20%. Gee, I wonder why?          \nThere\'s nothing wrong with a 15% tip.  My suggestion to the waitress is to find another job.  If she wants more, she should do more!          \nKeep in mind that American wait staff are not required by law to be paid minimum wage. They might be making $3/hr and need tips to make up most of their income.  \r\n \r\nA 15% tip is generally mandatory for that reason. You should only tip less if the service is really poor (and if the poor service was the waitress\' fault -- don\'t punish her if, say, your food is undercooked).  \r\n \r\nTo anyone who says the waitress should just get another job: if you *could* get another job, do you think you\'d be working in a place that pays $3/hr? This is the kind of job people do when there are no other options or they\'re desperate for a little bit more money than their other job pays.          \nI\'m a server and a 15% tip is not an insult. Some servers are just down right greedy.  In fact I worked with a few of them last night.          \n15% is not an insult. Give 20% for good service and higher for GREAT service.  If you\'re eating alone, you might want to tip higher than 15%, even for average service because many restaurants limits the number of tables a server can wait on at one time, so you\'re really paying for their time.  It takes about the same amount of effort to wait on a one person table as it does to wait on a two person table.          \n15% is average  20% for excellent service          \nActually tipping is not a requirement; it\'s a REWARD for good service.  I generally tip 15%, but increase or decrease the tip amount according to the level of service I receive.  If you want to see an interesting philosophy regarding tipping, I highly suggest that you view Mr. Pink\'s viewpoint early on in the movie "Reservoir Dogs."          \nNot at all. For basic service, 15% is fine. Above and beyond depends on how much you can afford.          \nIf your service was just ok not over the top....15% is ok \r\nIf she really worked for you and was pleasant and made your meal nicer. 20% is good \r\nIf she went overboard and you only left 15% \r\nShe should not be insulted, but she will remember you. \r\nI hear waitresses say they get nothing or only a dollar for a group,,,that is insulting.          \nSheep wolf in your closet. \r\nOpen up and set her free. \r\nAwoo.          \n15% is an insult if your server did a good job.  It is a minimum tip.  Years ago this was acceptable, but seeing as how the hourly wage has not gone up in 18 years and the cost of living has, 20% is to be given if you got good service, and more if the server was really good.  See servers make $2.13 an hour, after taxes we never see a paycheck.  My last paycheck was for less than $10 for 2 weeks of work. So when I get a 15% tip I\'m very angry. \r\n \r\nThe only time I would give 15% other than bad service would be at a buffet, because they don\'t serve you other than refill your drink.          \nno that is the perfect amount actually thats the average tip that some one would give and thats perffect!

	{'answer': u"\nThats illegal its kidnapping then again the law favors women evwn if they do drugs.          \nI would put my children first and though he is failing financially, your children deserve a father.  Why would you even consider doing to your children what his ex wife did to him and his kids!!          \nYou are crazy to move your kids away from their dad so your boyfriend can be with his child because youre putting you kids in the same situation your boyfriend is trying to alleviate. He needs to take her back to court. The more she violates the visitation order the more likely she will lose custody if he pursues  it.  The process for you would be to get permission from the court or father to move out of state & to provide him with your whereabouts (contact info) & arrange visitation.  Him being behind in child support has nothing to do with his visitation, the children needing their father or you breaking the law. Do things the right way so you are not charged with kidnapping or causing emotional harm to your own children.          \nIts called a petition for removal. \n \nYou have to file it in the court that issued custody and support orders and show good cause why it should be granted. \n \nThe reasons are typically better standard of living and best interests of the child will trump the usual factors.          \nmy answer is go to your counties family law center and petition for shared *50-50 custody - apparently he asked not for all his biological children, or your judge was not the best one so keep petitioning you'll get a judge that understand that too many leaves some children without love and attention one to one.

	 'question': u'\n    My current boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We live together and he has supported me 100% financially for about the last 8 months. I am divorced, and have two kids with my ex-husband.

He tried to fight it when she moved, they went to court and basically the judge told him that he wouldn\'t split up the brothers and sisters. (His ex also has older children from a previous relationship, which are his son\'s half siblings)  \nNow, because its 10 hours away, my boyfriend only sees his son once every 2 months, for two weeks.(on spring break, fall break, ect.) His ex has recently started not showing up to pick ups and drop offs, and changing visitation dates because she "doesn\'t have the money to bring him down." He took her to court once about it, and she just basically got a reprimand and was told to start following the parenting plan. Well she is still not, so basically my boyfriend feels like he doesn\'t have a choice but to move to Kansas, to be able to see his son regularly.  \nMy question is, in this situation, should I move out of state and take my kids away from their dad, would I even be able to, and what would the process be to do that? I live in TN currently, and as far as my ex husband goes, he is $11,000 behind in child support, but is otherwise a good dad.  ',

	{'answer': u'\n"Best" is really subjective.  I might love a cruise line, and you might hate it! \r\nI\'ve been on Carnival, Princess, and Royal Caribbean.   \r\nMy favorite of the three is Royal Caribbean.  They have nice looking ships, great service, and good food.  I have *not*, however, been on their largest ships (Freedom class and Oasis class); I have no interest in being on a ship that big with that many other people. \r\nMy one Princess cruise was OK, but the ship seemed very crowded a lot of the time.  They added a passenger deck to the ship while it was being built but didn\'t add any extra public space, and the public space was laid out in a fashion that caused traffic jams.  And the dining room we were assigned to was difficult to get to and seemed very dark. \r\nMy one Carnival cruise was also OK.  The ship\'s decor was very gaudy, and the atmosphere in the main dining room (where the decor had a lot of chrome and neon) was not at all dignified.  The maitre d\' even dressed like a clown one night.  Not my preference for a dining experience.  I\'m giving Carnival another chance next month. \r\n \r\nTake a look at various itineraries to get an idea of where you might like to go.  Then see which cruise lines go there.  Compare costs.  Go to sites like Cruise Critic and read reviews written by people who\'ve sailed those routes on those ships.  This should help you make your decision.          \nThat\'s very subjective.  NCL would be the lowest-quality of those three lines, but some people like the totally casual atmosphere they have.  Carnival and Royal are pretty even, quality-wise, based on what people I know who have done both say, with a slight edge to Carnival for food and service and a slight edge to Royal for the "bells and whistles", depending on which ships you\'re considering.          \nCarnival          \nAgree that Carnival has the best food but its atmosphere is more casual and catered to the younger crowd.          \ni have been on Royal and Carnival.  Royal\'s Explorer of the Seas was my first and i LOVEDDD it. the food selection and quality was outstanding, the activities were great, and we had extremely calm seas. my second was carnival. my whole family hated it. first of all, it was an older Carnival ship, so that may have something to do with it. it was the Carnival Miracle. its filled with elderly people (suprisingly) so the activites arent very fun. bingo is about the most exciting thing on there. the food selection was the SAME for every meal. same toast & scrambled eggs EVERY DAY for breakfast, same lunch items every day, same dinner items in the dining room EVERY DAY. the food wasnt all that great either. the decor was horrifyingly ugly, and the hallways with cabins were themed around "Fictional characters" so you saw ugly paintings of all sorts of random fictional characters EVERY FOOT. not even kidding. the ship overall was ugly and the same old stuff. i do NOT reccomend carnival, or older carnival ships, but royal is great.          \nAll three are pretty good cruise lines, but if you want to take a honeymoon cruise, DO NOT take it on one of the newer ships on Royal Caribbean.  There are just too many people on board those ships and although there is a lot to do on these ships, it\'s like applying for a job: there are 600 people trying to do the same thing you are and there\'s not much room for everyone.  Carnival is a great cruise line and I have fun every time I go with them.  Same for Norwegian.  I like the laid-back, casual atmosphere they have aboard their ships, especially dining when you want to b/t 6-10pm in any restaurant on the ship.  Try a ship just below the class of the newer ship and I\'m sure you will be delighted with the choice and the trip.          \nive been on royal carribean, monarch of the seas. it\'s such a beautiful ship, many things to do.. not many kids which was what i liked about it. \r\n \r\nim going on canival in november, i hope its just as great. \r\n \r\ngood luck!

	{'answer': u'\nI\'m choosing not to watch it.          \nI hadn\'t. Now I did. \r\nso.. what do I think of it... \r\nIt really is quite convincing. It makes you feel like it really is the best thing for everybody. It also kind of scared me, because I guess all those money he says would be saved are probably the money that people like me (whose main business is language teaching and translation) would not earn any longer. Nevertheless I find it illuminating and I saved the link because I want my husband to watch it. \r\nWe both have already studied some Esperanto and we are enthusiastic about it, even if this doesn\'t stop me from enjoying learning other languages.          \nHe got some of the points right. \r\nEnglish are not really efficient, and sometimes it is puzzling to non-native speakers. \r\n \r\nEsperanto is a new language, compared to English. Thus it has not went through any evolution on the language which can create interesting effects on the language itself (which in turn, creates anomalies, abnormalities, inconsistencies, in the language) \r\n \r\nHowever, even though Esperanto is ideal, it is too ideal. I doubt that it will replace English as the lingua france, not within these 30 - 40 years.  \r\n \r\nPeople\'s mindset over English as lingua france is way too strong, most Asians here doesn\'t even know what is Esperanto. Plus, Esperanto is a language created recently, it does not really has much root in culture, traditions, and more importantly, people\'s heart. \r\n \r\nHowever, I have read that Esperanto can accelerate language acquisitions, I will definitely want to try Esperanto.          \nIt was a thought provoking video, but the thoughts it provoked ultimately led me to the conclusion that I don\'t agree.   \r\n \r\nThe speaker says that people often have difficulty speaking fluently in English, despite having studied it in school for six or seven years.  This is certainly true.  But anything you study in school will be difficult for you to recall if you do not use it practically in your day to day life.  The same would be true for Esperanto, if the speaker\'s goal of having it universally taught came to pass - most people would learn it, rarely use it (because they were using their native language instead unless dealing with foreigners regularly) and have trouble speaking it if they suddenly needed to years later.   \r\n \r\nRight now, many people have to go to conferences on the subject of their profession (law, engineering, finance) etc. which are held in English - and they go there not because they have any particular interest in the English language, but because they are interested in the topic, or have to go for their job.  Naturally, some of them have difficulty expressing themselves in English when they get there.   \r\n \r\nNo one goes or gets sent to a conference in Esperanto unless they have made their own, free choice to devote a good deal of time and energy to studying the language for its own sake.  Anyone who goes out of their way to attend a conference like this is likely to speak it well, and enjoy speaking it, so they will be more natural and at ease. \r\n \r\nThis brings up another point - most people learn languages because they want to be able to understand things from another country - whether it is poetry, music, movies or scientific publications. While some of these things are available in Esperanto, there isn\'t much, compared to the new worlds that would open up to you by learning a major language such as English, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin, or many others.  Esperantists claim this would change  - if more people spoke Esperanto, more works would be produced in it, but even if that were true it would mean that most people would see little practical result from learning the language for decades, and then only if everyone else really were learning it, too. \r\n \r\nCertainly, it has its advantages, and the article I cited below talks about some of them.  In the end, though, I doubt it would actually achieve most of the results that its supporters seem to think it would, and it would be a pretty expensive experiment to try.          \nI\'ve seen this video before. In fact I\'ve read much of Claude Pirons work and he really does have a handle on the linguistic problems that are faced in the world. If you really want an eye opener with regards to language problems, read his works detailing his time as a translator at the UN. This is where you really get to understand how other languages manage to grind the weak and less used languages under their heels. If you really disagree with that, I suggest you read his stuff. It\'s very compelling. \r\n \r\n\u011cis! \r\n \r\nPS: Igor, I owe you an apology. I meant to hit thumbs up but hit thumbs down by mistake. Please disregard.          \nHi, GPB ! \r\n \r\nI can tell two cases which seem to suggest that you\'re mistaken. One is an Indian whom I saw after he had ceased speaking Esperanto for 18 years. He lived in a small town somewhere in the center of India where he was the only speaker of the language, and he couldn\'t afford to travel. He happened to be sent to Europe and I met him in Geneva, Switzerland, where he contacted me. For the first 30 minutes he was quite shy, and found it difficult to express himself, but the more he spoke, the more the language came back and after two hours he spoke fluently. We spoke Esperanto every day for a whole week, and it was as easy for both of us as if it had been our mother tongue. \r\nThe other case is a Pole I met in New York, where I was working at the time. He had participated in an Esperanto youth organization, but he had left it long ago and didn\'t believe in the language anymore. Somehow when we met I mentioned the language, and just for fun he asked me a question in Esperanto, telling me he had completely forgotten how to speak it. But I went on speaking Esperanto, and after maybe fifteen minutes he started being able to express most of his ideas. He was extremely surprised himself, since he had quit using the language 25 years before. After one hour or so he spoke fluently.  \r\nMy experience is that such a rapid return of a forgotten tongue does not happen with other languages. I guess it can be explained by the extreme regularity, consistency, exceptionlessness of Esperanto. My own difficulties in English are always due to inconsistencies. For instance I don\u2019t know which syllable to stress in *alternative*, I say *costed* instead of *cost*, I don\u2019t remember if *cough* rhymes with *tough*, *though*, *through* or some other ough-word, I know that the adjectives I want when writing about astronomy exist, but I need a dictionary to retrieve them, because I cannot make up *solar* from *sun* or *stellar* from *star*, just as I cannot form *dentist* from *tooth*, *disarmament* from *weapon*, or *colt* from *horse*. None of these problems exists in Esperanto. The whole structure of the language supports you, and helps you find the form you need.  \r\nSo I think you should check your opinion about Esperanto being lost after a period of non-use against reality. At times, what seems logical at first sight may be disproved (or is it *disproven*?) by experience.          \nHello, \r\n \r\nThis answer deals with a number of points brought up by GPB. \r\n \r\n1. Comparing the "recallability" of any language and particularly English to Esperanto is like comparing integral calculus to simple addition. Unless you are a genius, learning calculus requires real work and remembering it years later would certainly be difficult. On the other hand, simple addition comes naturally. The same goes for Esperanto. You really have to check it out before you assume similar levels of difficulty. \r\n \r\n2. By saying that people have to go to conferences held in English, we may conclude that 94% of humanity are confronted with a dominant (foreign) language. Some people, generally the other 6%, respond by saying that a dominant language is a fact of life. Given the past several thousand years, they do have history on their side, but does that make the situation fair, equitable or desirable? I think not, particularly when a large (a few million) group of people have made a major effort to create, develop and promote an effective solution whose whole idea is to level the playing field and give everyone an equal chance, while reducing the overall workload for us all (I know many English-speaking people who have learned Esperanto very quickly). \r\n \r\n3. Concerning the cultural question, you are right, the culture of Esperanto is similar to that of a small country and would take time to develop even under the best of conditions. I will simply say that quantifying/qualifying different cultures is most tricky. \r\nBut do not forget that Esperanto provides very easy access to all cultures and it is truly gratifying during an Esperanto conference to be able to walk up to any of thousands (literally) of people from dozens of countries and start talking on an equal footing. \r\n \r\n4. Concerning the results already achieved by the language, that would require a long discussion, but for anyone interested, there are more than enough sites in virtually all languages that present the current status of Esperanto. \r\n \r\n5. As for the cost of teaching Esperanto, have you looked at the cost of teaching English ? And the results ? Having taught English, French and Esperanto, I can say from personal experience that people (particularly children) learn Esperanto much faster, much easier and, most important, the end result is far superior. By that, I mean that they can understand and express themselves better after 200 hours of lessons (two school years @ three hours per week) than they probably ever will in English or French. Unless of course they move out of their country. \r\n \r\nAnother aspect is that training in English in school requires such effort that time is drawn from training for the mother tongue (that is the situation in France) and virtually no time is left for other languages. Given that English is the first foreign language (96% in France, mandatory in Germany) taught, we are caught in a funnel, headed toward a "just English" situation in international communication. That is neither fair nor cost effective. And loss of diversity is certainly not a good thing either. \r\n \r\nSo, for what it is worth, there you have a few remarks. \r\n \r\nLook forward to hearing from you. \r\n \r\nF. Bartsch \r\nbartsch@bartsch.fr          \nYes I watched it recently and have just re-watched it.  He certainly proves his point about English, whether intentionally or not by the mistakes which he makes!  I gave up counting them.  I have heard him in Esperanto and I certainly was not distracted by mistakes - a little by the accent maybe - but I could concentrate on what he was saying and the brilliant style and expressiveness he used in saying it.          \nHe knows much about international communication and language problems - both from the viewpoint of a translator - interpreter and the psychological one. I think he is very logical and convincing.          \nI watched the video and I think the translator hit the nail on the \r\nhead. \r\nKurt Fischer \r\nBreslauer Str. 15 \r\nDE - 63927 Buergstadt \r\nGermany          \nI think we need Esperanto as the internacional language!          \nL\'ho visto. Pi\xf9 volte. \r\nIneccepibile! \r\nCongratulazioni all\'autore. \r\nLa questione \xe8 geopolitica. \r\nChi \xe8 uomo di stato - non un politicastro - non pu\xf2 pi\xf9 eludere il problema.          \nGreat stuff. Now we need something to explain why Esperanto hasn\'t already become a first foreign language for the world. Is it because it\'s too good to be believed without seeing? Or is it, as with many good ideas, because of interventions by people with vested interests?          \nI watched the video and I\'m sure Claude Piron is right. Esperanto is the only way forward for all people living in the European community with so many languages a real Tower of Ba\'bel. It cost 5 minutes of political courage to decide to teach Esperanto in the elementary schools. What\'s keeping our politicians from doing so!          \nI watched it several times.  It seems to be a very honest and informative presentation, worthy to be viewed by people of all ages and interests.          \nLearning and using Esperanto is a fantastic experience. First, you can learn it in a fraction of the time it takes to learn most other languages. Many people start using Esperanto within a couple of weeks after their first contact with the language. Of course, they make many mistakes ... but still, they are easily understood. And they understand what they read. \r\n \r\nEsperanto is not going to stop people from learning other languages. Many people that learned Esperanto went on learning other languages. Once that you have the experience that you can communicate with people using a language other than your native, you start wanting to learn other languages. After all ... I learned English after I learned Esperanto. \r\n \r\nYou may start to enjoy Esperanto by visiting my homepage at   and following some of its many links. Please write to me if you have any questions. My e-mail address is in all my pages. Just click the word, \r\n \r\nEnrique \r\n \r\n \r\nFremont, California, USA          \nJes, I watched it twice and I entirely agree! \r\nEsperanto is easy to learn and is a very good tool for communication and travel. \r\nJust try it: http://www.lernu.net          \nThe video packs an amazing amount of relevant information into just 8 minutes, yet gets the idea across clearly.  The speaker comes across as very knowledgeable and convincing.  An excellent introduction to the language problem and Esperanto as a solution.          \nI watched it twice already and passed the link people who I believe will understand, and maybe even share, Mr. Piron\'s point of view. \r\nGhis! \r\nMar =)          \nI\'v just watched. \r\nWell, I agree with him. But most of people don\'t. \r\nI hope one they everybody will speak Esperanto as a second language.          \nEveryone concerned about inter-cultural communication should see this video!          \nYes I watched this video and it belongs to the more interesting videos posted on YouToube! \r\nJes mi vidis chi-tiun videon kaj ghi apartenas al la pli interesaj videoj metita en Ju-Tube. \r\nAmike Michi          ',

	{'answer': u'\nsince he is found to be more of a liberal obama will pardon him now          \nYour Savior Sarah Palin caused the tragedy. \n \nAnd quit calling your son Jared names!  Why do you think he is so messed up in the first place. Show him some love once in a while and we all wouldn\'t be going through this.          \nNo. \r\nHe\'s sick. \r\nThis shooting was just a cry for help. \r\nHe was just as much a victim in this as Sarah Palin.          \nYes, and his last meal should be his copy of the Communist Manifesto force fed to him          \nThis is the REAL focal point of this tragic incident NOT "innocent till proven guilty"---because there\'s overbearing evidence, including video of the rampage, proving Jared Loughner IS guilty of murder. \r\n \r\nIt\'s a given that Loughner will present himself to the court as "insane"; it\'s his best and only defense aimed at his best case scenario: life incarceration in a mental facility--much like John Hinkley got. \r\n \r\nBut Hinkley did NOT kill anybody....Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz did, who also tried the insanity defense; he got natural life incarceration in a prison.  Logical doubts exist Loughner will get incarcerated in a mental hospital. \r\n \r\nSo it comes down to two scenario options: Natural life in prison or death penalty execution. \r\n \r\nAnd given the evidence shows Loughner PLANNED in detail his assassination of one single person-- that target being Congresswoman Giffords---the plan evidently went awry, causing a free will shooting rampage that killed nine people---including a 9 year old girl and a Arizona Federal Judge, odds DO lean towards death penalty for Loughner.   \r\n \r\nWhy is simple: Pre-meditation is evident---doesn\'t matter how animal wild "insane" Loughner chooses to present himself on his court date w/ the judge. Loughner could set a precedent---and march to his death by legal court order execution as an "insane" man.          \nI\'ll bet money he never goes to trial, he\'s \'insane\'.........          \nThat is an excellent question.  Arizona does have the death penalty and has executed a total of 22 people since 1976.  Surely this was a premeditated act of multiple murder so I would think it is a death penalty case. \r\n \r\nWhether this individual is mentally ill or not, if ever there was someone who deserved it it would be this gentleman.    \r\n \r\nFor Any parent the hardest thing ever imaginable is losing a child and to see the parents and loved ones of that beautiful 8 year old girl who was killed suffer is so sad, not to mention the others who lost their lives and were injured.          \nHopefully your brain will get the death penalty, for the good of America.          \nSome people stupidly rushed to the judgment that he was right wing. Then it came out that he was actually apolitical and the fact that Giffords\' district was on Sarah Palin\'s list of targets was a coincidence. How do you get from there to the idea he was left-wing? \r\n \r\nThere are actually people we all find reprehensible. Just because you disagree with someone doesn\'t mean that your political opponents agree with them. For example, I like puppies and kittens. Do you like puppies and kittens? I\'ll bet you do. See, there are some things that liberals and conservatives actually agree on. Among them, the guy who shot the Democratic congresswoman and killed 6 others including a little girl was crazy and the events were terrible.          \nThe leftists will turn him into a victim and then try to punish everyone else with gun control.          \n6          \nNah you see its similar to a situation I found myself in a few years ago. The year was 1357 and WW2 had just been declared, I found myself in space with nothing but a club soda and a nutella sandwich. I had to fight my way through 14 waves of U.S. congressmen to get to the end of space itself which in those days was called the republic of Georgia. I had gone 1775443 lightyears with no food, but folks were stronger back in those dyas. I was leading the Stalingrad defense later that night \r\n \r\nBut the magic turnip was never seen again \r\n \r\nI hope this helps          \nI doubt it the  libs will say the gun is at fault and the man had a boo hoo childhood          \nI think it should be the death penalty. I think he needs the chair or maybe Obama can hire Michael Vick to execute him.          \nI can\'t predict the future. If I could, I sure as hell wouldn\'t be on here. I\'d be the new Miss Cleo.          \nYour (R)ant FAILS! He stalked and shot a DEMOCRAT who he hated (thanks to Fox and Falin Palin and the GOP) because she voted yes on the health care bill! Now don\'t you look salty!          \nI don\'t know anything about any left wing dope heads, but I am sure Loughner will, if there is any justice left in this world.          \nKill someone, in this country? No he committed Federal crime. If it was Texas, oh yeah          ',

No matter how good it is, it won\'t be perfect.          \nThey should be eliminated for good. I\'m trilingual and it\'s a slap on the face seeing these ppl getting best answer. Grab a book if you so desperately want to impress people.          \nIch finde online \xfcbersetzer richtig doof und Leute die diese benutzen und sich als Muttersprachler ausgeben total \xfcberflussig. \r\n \r\nI find on-line \xfcbersetzer really stupidly and people use this and itself as a native speaker are totally economical \xfcberflussig. \r\n \r\nI find Online translators really stupid and people that use these and glaim to be native speaker are totally useless.          \nTell me about it... "/ Why dn\'t they just go out and actually learn the language, Its way better than giving such a horid translation of things. All they do is sit behind a desk, coping and pasteing the sh (I), pretending they can speak the languge. It gets me piss & I can understand how people feel (The ones who can ACTUALLY speak another language)          \nYou are absolutely right I agree 100 % . \r\nI think it is also very unfair towards the asker to use these things without saying so or even pretending to be a native or worse a teacher. \r\nI keep telling people to keep away from these online translations as most time you get really bad translations as they just translate word for word no correct grammar even the word might be wrong as there are often several possible meanings.......          \nThere are those who need SO much to prove themselves worthy the will make fools of themselves to do it. \r\nvirtual translators suck. There is no real replacement for learning a language or a live translator.          \nI understand a fair amount of japanese and I have used both the google translate this page thing and windows translator .The result is usually hilarious .They are obviously compiled by people who know japanese but dont fully understand english and a understanding of both is required for a proper translation.          \nThey have their use, but deception should not be one of them.          \ni don\'t mind them. \r\n \r\nOn a game i play im a helper so i basically work as a living FaQ on the game, the only problem is a lot of people don\'t speak english who play (which is odd considering the game is in english) so i end up figuring out what the language is, then using altvista to translate the question as best i can. \r\n \r\nThen i send my response with both english answer, and with the babelfish translation.  Its the only REAL way for me to respond as my knowledge of most foreign languages is minimal at best.          \nI have to agree with Hilmar!  \r\nI keep telling people not to use on line translator because they give wrong answers. \r\n \r\nHave you tried to type a sentence like :  \r\nje ne peux pas prendre l\'avion car j\'ai mal au coeur chaque fois que je le fais. \r\nHere is the translation from Babel fish : \r\nI cannot take l\'avion bus j\'ai nausea each time I do it \r\n \r\nKind of funny...no?  \r\nAnother thing about trolls : they have a new game ! they put thumbs down, hoping that they will convince the asker that some good answer are wrong. \r\nHilmar will agree with me about that...          \nThis is so true!  I sometimes try to explain why auto-translators don\'t  work and if it seems to be homework I warn them their teacher will get a laugh before giving them a bad score - - that it\'s just like taking for each word the first listed definition - -when it may be the wrong definition, and WILL be in the wrong order since grammar varies by language .  A few also are programmed to recognize and translate some common phrases,  or to attempt to conjugate a verb based on the closest noun - - but they do this with limited success.  \r\nAuto translators  can be somewhat useful to translate FROM an unknown language to just try to get a basic sense of what something is about- -BUT even for that you must realise their limitations. And for anything where details are critical, and for translating TO a language you don\'t know well, they are not trustworthy.   \r\nI too have given dictionary links like LEO instead.  \r\n \r\nIt\'s bad enough that people give auto-trans answers for an easy 2 points and admit they are auto-trans. What is REALLY annoying --and bizarre - -are the people who lie and put "not an auto translator" when it really is, or pretend to be a "native speaker"  or "teacher"  to convince people their auto-trans answers (or 1st year language course- level answers) are right!   Some fakes are more creative in their impersonation - - or really less creative but more plagiaristic (is that a word?) : a while ago I noticed an answer with a comment in another language that sounded very familiar.... and yes, it was copied and pasted from a discussion on another forum!    I even hesitate to put something in "Source" regarding myself because it has been so devalued by people lying about this. Anyway it is complicated because I was not just raised in one place. \r\n \r\nI too have seen a lot of thumbs down lately to good answers  recently - -  and of course without explaining in an answer of their own exactly what they found wrong.  I think our intent in answering should be not to try to get some meaningless points but to try to help the questioner or other people who read it understand better for themselves, so I prefer it if someone explains why they disagree with an answer.          \nPeople use the translators for one of two reasons:  either they actually believe that a machine can translate for them, or they want to look like they are foreign, and may not be. \r\n \r\nI don\'t think anyone who has more than two years\' language study could POSSIBLY think they are being smart and looking intelligent by using a machine.

I was winning until a giant whale jumped through the ship and eat me. I woke up shaking, but i was only 12.           \nHmm, I had a dream that the evil doll Chucky was coming to kill me. I'm scared of dolls and he's the worst. So in the dream he would always come and chase me or call me on the phone saying he was going to kill me.  \r\nOthers are like my friends or family dying and stuff. Sometimes those are even worse.          \nMan, that's scary (i get scared easily, that's why I couldn't sleep well when I first saw the first exorcist movie!)  \r\n \r\nIn my night mare.. It seemed like a happy one... I was supposedly walking home from school on a good day, pretty happy.. there was a car that followed me from a bit back.. I turned to look who it was.. Then two guys got out and started chasing me.. I ran... I remember that there was a sort of bridge that I jumped off of.. there was a construction zone below.. I landed on a huge pile of sand.. so I kept running.. Then this is where it gets wierd... the two guys appear infront of me... on of them has like a black revolver...          \nWhat happened in my dream: \r\n \r\nI was 10 years old in my dream (and while I had the dream). The sky was a ghastly green and very cloudy. I was taking out the trash, and a big beige van pulled up in the parking lot. A white man with all black clothing and sunglasses grabbed me and tied me up and threw me in the back seat and then drove off. I remember him beating me and me crying. Then it flashed to me being in the hospital, and him saying he was my dad or something. I then started screaming at the nurse and told her he'd beat me... when she ran out her started beating me some more. It was so incredibly scary. It's a dream I'll never forget.          \nok this is weird and awesome but i had a dream that Chris Brown had me in his bed and was giving it to me! \r\nyummy!          \nMy worst dreams are the one with my dad in them.  My dad was a drug abuser and alcoholic, a very verbally abusive alcoholic.  Well, I've had about four dreams about him, and in ever dream, he's trying to kill me.  I remember one where he held me and my mom hostage in our house (my parents are divorced, I live with mom) and he decided to let me go.  As I was walking down the sidewalk, he came out with a gun and shot me in the shoulder, and I did the little spin-thing they do in moveis.  When I hit the ground is when I woke up.  I would have to say that was the worst one of the four.  There was also a dream where he took my mom away with a rope around her neck, that was pretty horrific - got my heartbeat going!          ",
	 'question': u'\n    Hillary Clinton in a two-piece bikini. \r\n \r\nIn all seriousness, The scariest one I ever had was when a horde of zombies was at our neighborhood. I watched our neighbor across the street furiously fight for his life, before being torn apart in front of my very eyes. I ran downstairs crying, and it started raining with thunder strikes. I heard the doorbell ring, and for some reason I opened the door (stupid I know) and a very pale woman was standing there. She asked me to hug her, and then fell over onto me while her face was rotting, and her black and dead skin was falling all over me. I pushed her away frantically and ran back in the house. The glass of my back door shattered and they came pouring in, but by then I was already in the garage with my car loaded. I drove out of our neighborhood and up the street, all the while hitting zombies and getting gore all over my car and wind shield and then I woke up. \r\n \r\n I was traumatized.  \r\n \r\nWhat has been your worst Dream yet?

	{'answer': u"\ni went  on a cruise and it was really fun..it had a waterslide and ike 3 pools and a teen party place and a casino and stuff like that...i dont remember what the name of it was but it was a carnival cruise          \nBoth have some really good kids activities and areas, but Carnival is more casual and Royal is more formal in the way people dress in the dining room. The biggest ship afloat right now is RCCL's Oasis of the Seas but Carnival has some great ships also. You can't go wrong with either.          \nRCCL Oasis \r\nCCL - Dream          \nI would say the Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas or the Liberty of the Seas.  They have the things you mentioned, plus rock climbing wall and surfing on the ship and great food and service which will please your parents.          \nROYAL CARIBBEAN!!!!!! me and my sister are around your guy's ages . I would definatly say RC. Freedom of the seas or Oasis of the seas. They have everything.. rock wall, mini golf, pools, waterslides, teen clubs, wave rider thing, gift shops, amazing ships. If i were you i would go onto RC website and compare those two ships. I think oasis is supossest to be the biggest ship out there for crusies lol. I have been on three family cruises and they are just amazing. I mean You dont have to stick with your parents the whole time so you get all that independance. Even if your not into that kind of stuff i mean theres lounges tvs and everything . Crusises are amazing. The dining is spectacular and the staff on cruises are awsome. Your going to love it and i suggest you pick your location first becasue some ships only do certain areas. So look at thoses ships and see where they are going. Like for the next long while Freedom of the SEas is only doing caribbeanand so is oasis so that fits in well with your plan!! Have fun :)          \nWell, in my opinion, Royal Caribbean is much better than Carnival. What you are looking for is all in the Royal Caribbean Liberty of the Seas ship or maybe the Oasis of the Seas. \r\nLet me tell you, I went on Liberty of the Seas and its awesome. Maybe, if you dont want to or know already the ports of call, you can stay in and enjoy the ship.          \ni would choose royal carribean  oasis of the seas it has it all.2 wave rider pools, zip line , 2 rock walls., ice skating, water slide, and like 4 pools. they also have a bigger teen program. they have a teen lounge and teen disco and teen only deck, spa and exercise area. this area is only for 12-17 yr olds. they also have mini golf and basketball. we just went on carnival in june and my 15 yr old was so bored he actually snuck into the 12-14 yr old group. the pools om carnival are all salt water and i know at least one on royal carribean is fresh water.

It\'s always at 2am during infomercials. I\'d be more concerned about that *BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!* sound it makes.          \nThat\'s a great point. It happened the other night while watching one of the only TV shows I actually like.  \r\nA few times there were actual emergencies, like a tornado in my county or city. They also break in for amber alerts here as well.          \nBecause they want to ruin whatever you\'re watching so that you\'ll just give in and go out and buy it anyway.  Same with all the other random crap they always have littered all over the screen: logos, promos for other shows, time/temperature updates, lottery numbers, news about a convenience store robbery thats 420 miles away playing repeatedly across the bottom or top of the screen in some neon orange box that takes up a quarter of the picture, etc, etc. \r\n \r\nAnd, considering that the "Emergency Broadcast System" gets "tested" left and right, and never seems to find use in any actual emergencies, I can only imagine the number of people who would pass off a genuine "Emergency Broadcast" as a "test" if a real emergency ever came along.

	{'answer': u'\nMy experience is that exactly the opposite is the case.  Shop bought bread contains preservatives and that is why bread in the shop today will have a use by date at least 5 days ahead of today\'s date. \r\n \r\nHome made bread does not have the preservatives (I would not know what to add to preserve it) and does not keep even into a third day (unless frozen).  When I make my own bread I make small loaves or bread rolls and ensure that I have an empty shelf in my freezer so it can be frozen in small batches for future use.  It\'s too much work and takes up too much space whilst rising to want to do that every day.          \nI work with a lot of Senior Citizens and in my experience there is really no difference between the home made bread and store bought bread. it is usually the temperature of the dwelling which is the biggest contributing factor. I leave most of my bread in the freezer and will take it out the night before and toast it in the mornings. Most of the people I work with either have a bread bin or just leave it out. the temperature of the home is usually so high in some of these peoples homes is that the bread will dry and then go moldy quickly. I know some elderly people who have their thermostat so high that the wall paper starts to burn and peel off the walls. ha ha          \nIt\'s made with \'Sensitive wheat\',that can\'t take criticism?          \nDid you mean to ask this the opposite way round because the opposite is how it actually is?  Home made bread is far better for us but goes off quickly unless kept in the fridge or freezer.  Manufactured bread has things added to make it keep.  Some shop bought breads are guaranteed to keep fresh for a full week.  \r\n \r\nI have made my own bread for very many years (but not all of it).  I know how to make it by hand and I have a bread maker which I use just occasionally.  When I\'m in the mood to make some I make a large batch - keep some out to use, freeze some and give some to a relative with the instruction to use by tomorrow at the latest.  It is usually eaten quickly though because it is so very nice.          \nIt doesn\'t.  Shop bought bread is loaded with preservatives to make it last longer.          \nI do not think that is true Thomas... Most of those store bought have additives & preservatives.  However, the small shop bakery breads do not and have a tendency to spoil if not used soon just like home made.          \nIf you freeze each slice individually - a loaf lasts for ages.  Straight out of freezer into toaster.  Works fine. \r\n \r\nMo          \nMy homemade loaves go off so quickly Thomas that I only make them when I know the rest of the family are visiting so they can help to polish them off. \n \nAs others have mentioned the bought bread both white and brown loaves are packed with preservatives so much so that it  just daren\'t go off..))          \nAs your famous seventeenth-century poet observed, lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.  \r\n \r\nThe chemicals that are put into commercial bread to make it squishier and therefore more appealing to ignorant consumers at the supermarket are so noxious that when they eventually lose their brief, intended effect, the bread winds up tasting nastier than if it had simply gone stale in the old fashioned way. \r\n \r\nAmong the poisons commonly used in commercial bread are: \r\n \r\nBleached flour has been stripped of its nutritive value. \r\n \r\nHydrogenated oils. Well known poisons that cause heart disease. \r\n \r\nHigh-fructose corn syrup. A well known poison that causes diabetes. \r\n \r\nAzocarbonamide. An industrial compound used in the manufacture of plastics. It causes asthma. \r\n \r\nPotassium bromate. A carcinogen that also causes hormone imbalances. \r\n \r\nPropionic acid. Which has been found to cause autistic behavior in laboratory animals. \r\n \r\nAnd L-cysteine. A non-essential amino acid that is usually harvested from human hair. Most of the hair comes from barbershop floors in China.          \nIt\'s not a secret that many stores, including many big national chain businesses, cheat on the sell by date.  If the store bought bread goes off too early, it could mean it\'s already not very fresh when you first bought it even though it could indicated it was freshly made.  It\'s very easy to change the sell by date. \n \nOther than preservatives, whether we\'d touched the bread with our clean or dirty hands and utensils also matters.          \nDon\'t know the answer to that one, but I have been very suspicious of the oatnut bread by Orowheat here in the USA. It seems it never shows signs of mold or becoming stale! Wonder what type chemicals are in that! I\'m speaking of a loaf more than two weeks old!          \nI believe these so called loaves of "fresh-bread" are anything but fresh my friend.  It,s my opinion most of our " daily-bread " is prepared and stored long before reaching any retailers.          \nI have never had shop bought bread go off easily.  Home made does though but it\'s far nicer. \r\n \r\nI make occasionally, when in the mood but I buy large sliced loaves and take 4 slices out of it and freeze the rest.  It is very easy to take another 4 slices out by just tapping the loaf on the worktop. The slices separate easily then and thaw very quickly. \r\n \r\nI usually have 2 slices of toast after my breakfast porridge and then have 2 sandwiches at lunch time.  If I didn\'t freeze the remainder of the loaf it would be slightly stale by the end of the week but would not have gone mouldy - just rather dry.          \nGraybear has a good answer.          \nI supposed it is "planned obsolescence" but I really do not know, as I have been baking my own bread ever since my then wife refused to do so in the early 1960s. I bake two loaves, and put one in the fre\xe9zer. The first one I take a week to get through (I now live alone) and is still fresh at the end of that period.. Then I defrost the second loaf which then lasts just as long. My ingredients are yeast (fresh, whenever I can get it), wholemeal wheaten flour, a little salt, and water from the tap, which is this area is quite hard. I line the bread pans with butter to stop the loaves sticking to the sides of the pan, so I suppose a tiny amount of butter gets into the flour. Sometimes the very end of a loaf gets a little hard; in that case I soke it in my soup or chili-con-carne when I next have a dish of either.          \nthat\'s odd because i think it\'s the other way round. when i make my own bread, with no additives, i must use it that day or the next or it will go hard but shop bought bread will usually keep for four or five days. must be all the stuff they put in it!          \nShop bread is usually steam cooked so is over moist and can go off very quickly whereas home bread is baked and therefore a little dryer so appears not to last so long.Thats what I think.          \ni think its to do with the wrappiing, most shop bought bread comes in plastic bags in the u/k, so when you open it then re/seal it, it traps fresh air inside the bag which then reacts with the moisture in the bread and causes mould, which usually starts with the tell tale little green spots, which then turns to the green fur coat, i prefer bread wrapped in the grease proofed paper,[WARBURTONS] it usually lasts 5/6 days, then starts to go crusty, so its then toast time.          \nMy bread is made with organic products.  It always lasts a week.  It\'s kept in a bread bin. \r\n \r\nShop bought bread isn\'t supposed to go off.  I shall have to buy some and see how long it lasts under the same conditions. \r\n \r\nThomas you might be interested in my link in connection with this subject. \r\n \r\n \r\n          \nWe find that supermarket bread goes off or mouldy in only a day or two even if we buy from the so-called better ones.It is often already on the shelves with what looks like condensation inside the wrappers which smacks of having come out of a cold-store & this could certainly be why it goes off so quickly. \r\n \r\nAs we have a very good local bakery at the end of our street where we live now we tend to buy our bread from there.It is baked freshly twice a day,can be cut on the premises to any thickness you want it to be & last for days longer than supermarket loaves.Their cakes are sublime too. \r\n \r\nThe loaves are a little dearer but the exquiste taste more than makes up for that & it smells like bread used to smell.Even the crusts taste good. \r\n \r\nThe gigantic flour tankers cause a road blockage when they deliver but it is worth the hassle to have the end product to enjoy.

	{'answer': u'\nWell said haha. I usually kick them in the stomach          \nI\'m with you on that. I won\'t take any of that nonsense at all.          \nsame thing my poetic friend          \nBe polite every time...          \nAfter many years of working with the public, I usually try to give the offender a chance to redeem themselves by ignoring the first snipe or unprofessional manners. (we all can have a bad day)The second comes with a sterner tone from me and the third will have me demanding to speak with their supervisor. They think they invented bad behavior. One not so nice girl gave me a co worker instead of her supervisor. I\'m too smart for that and the girl didn\'t want dragged into it and fessed up. She had done this to her before. Once I actually got a supervisor, I only talked about the issue that I had called to get resolved, once that was done I only referred her to the tape recording and knew she\'d find all the necessary information on her employee there to take appropriate steps or actions. I added that she be fired. I do always try to applaud very good service. That\'s worth more of my energy.          \nFace to face, I give them a blank stare.  I have walked away. \r\n \r\nOn the phone I tell them that when they can talk to me like a human being, I\'ll listen.  Then I hang up.          \nI try to stay calm and not respond aggressively.  If their approach continues to be "sharp" I may make a complaint to customer services.          \nIf they do that to me, I will do the same to them..remember the saying "do unto others as they do unto you"..=)          \nThere was a new employee at one of the shops I frequent, who treated me like dirt the first time she saw me.  Damn, but was she surprised when she learned that I owned the shop!          \nI become as sharp as them.          \ndont bother me i reverse the charges..!          \nin verbal judo, deflect them with kindness. agree with the disagreeable and often they melt. a smile is more effective than revenge.          \nI immediately go somewhere else.  There is space enough where there are no people.          \npull the plug,.)          \nI get overly nice and sarcastic,or just offensive.          \nI can\'t recall that ever happening. \r\nHowever, my policy with people coming to my door touting religion, magazines, etc. is to decline their pitch politely. \r\nI only decline politely ONCE.          \nOn the phone, I note the department, the time, and the name of the "advisor".  Then terminate the call politely.  I then call back and ask to speak to the call centre manager.  I politely tell them about the failure in their training initiatives, and ask them to pass me to an advisor who is capable to deal with my request. \r\n \r\nIn a shop, I will ask to speak to the owner or manager and explain politely why they have just lost a sale.   \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nWhen they stop the abuse, I tell them I am very hard of hearing and I ask them to repeat what they said.          \na soft answer turns away wrath. try to ignore any rude comments if not possible end the conversation a.s.a.p. with an excuse such as " sorry, I have to go to the necessity. "          \nI have done what Suzie S. recommends, tell them you didn\'t hear it and ask them to repeat it. A usual reply is "Oh never mind"...bullies don\'t like to hear themselves when a person stands up to their sharp tongues. \r\n \r\nI work as a greeter and there are some people who have to be smart-mouthed no matter how kind polite & respectful we are to them. In such cases I won\'t reply in kind, but have the attitude that it\'s not me with the  problem but them.  I have learned that there are people who think their life is worse than others and will lash out at anyone they can thinking that the other people have it better.  We all have our problems...some are better at dealing with them than others.          \nI get sharp quick with them. Just awhile back I got into a rile with Direct TV. Shortly into it the person I was talking with calmed quickly.It is amazing when you demand to talk to a supervisor how quickly their attitude changes.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nThey aren\'t always accurate especially with a language like Japanese.          \nMy friend is learning Japanese and last year, when she got much much better at it (her family are friends with someone who married a Japanese woman, and she sent her books to learn the language) \r\nshe said "I\'ve noticed how crap Google translate is, half of the time it isn\'t even accurate!" Istill however use it sometimes, it gives you the basic understand of what a person is trying to say but i wouldn\'t use it to learn          \nWell, the free ones just arent that accurate. I use them to get a better understanding of what my Spanish friends are saying on Facebook, but I wouldn\'t use it to write someone a letter.  \r\nTry this at home. Get a favorite song lyric, copy and paste it to translate to another language, then translate it back to english. Then ask your friends to try and guess what song it is.  \r\nIt\'s fun.          \nYes.  They don\'t put the words in the correct order.  \r\n \r\nSo, they can\'t do much in terms of helping you understand the sentence structure, since they don\'t USE it.  \r\n \r\nI use it like a dictionary.  (Usually google, or freetranslation), and sometimes, I\'ll plug in an entire phrase, to see what it says, but you HAVE to be able to make heads or tails yourself.          \nThey\'re pretty terrible, yeah. Single words and the simplest of phrases usually come out okay, and you may get lucky if a whole sentence makes sense, but the vast majority of what you get is grammatically incorrect of just plain wrong. I find translating English to other European languages like French or German work better than, say, trying to translate English into Japanese or Hindi, and vice versa.          \nOnline translators are fast and can be helpful.  However, the quality of translation does not compare to one by someone who actually speaks the language.  Some examples of things they are really bad at include when the same word means different things or for idiomatic expressions.   \r\n \r\nFor a fun way to see the problems with relying on English-Japanese online translators, check out translationparty.com          \nThey beat nowhere on, that can I you on a little letter give!

	{'answer': u'\nDon\'t sexualize ones sexual orientation. They\'re people not some sort of fetish that you get off from. Also, just because one is bisexual does not mean that they are willingly open to anyone for a three way that includes both genders nor that they are willing to date more than one person at a time. I personally don\'t find it wrong when my partner finds someone else pleasing in their eyes (let\'s be realistic, will you only ever think and feel that your partner is the only one that is attractive when in a relationship?), but I do find it problematic when they start associating with anyone to get something out of it or if they shame me about by comparing me with others. Checking someone out does not make one a "slut" nor should she be shamed or valued less for being more sexually active (although I don\'t think someone her age should do such activities, but I\'m not going to police her on her choices nor do I care much). Being myself and not caring for the gender or looks of my partner, I could relate in a way. Including having my experience of dating individuals whom were bisexual. I could care less of their sexual orientation and whom they\'re "more sexual opened to" as you had put it.          \nWell, I can tell you two things about this: \n \n1. Based on what I know so far about difference between heterosexual men and bi-sexual women is that a hetero man probably has not idea of the aggressiveness that bi-sexual women will develop if she is denied opportunity to have a woman. The best way to think about it is as one of your hetero guy friends, who has been denied a girl, and ask, "What would he do? How desperate will be become?" A bi-sexual woman will exhibit same behaviors, which includes looking at naked hetero women in the locker-room. It is important to understand this, because if you think of her as a chick who happens like like chicks every now and then, you might be surprised at what she does. Also, many bi-sexual women are promiscuous. It\'s not so much their fault. The same physiological process that makes them bi-sexual also drives them to seek out sex, and since they need it from both men and women (if they are truly bi and not lesbian pretending to be bi), that\'s roughly twice the activity. \n \n2. Her desire to have a guy or a girl will change according to her hormone patterns. Sometimes she will want a guy, and feel like traditional woman. Sometimes she will want a guy with girl nearby. Sometimes she will want a girl, and the idea of guy being around when she has the girl will be gross. \n \nP.S. -  \n \nI asked a question recently about bi-sexual or lesbian women checking out straight women in locker-room, as it would make logical sense. I think this is very wrong, and is a violation of the privacy of those being watched. It is not very much different than a doctor checking out his naked patient while examining her - you are in the presence of someone where there is an implicit expectation that you are not being checked-out by that person, but that is what is occurring, so it is a violation. Here is my question: \n \n \n \nJust keep in mind - she is *not* heterosexual, and appreciate that.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    (Im in middle school btw) We were texting as usual and we were talking about another bi kid and she just came out and told me she was bi. I was ok with it at first because the thought of her making out with a chick was pretty sexy. Anyways, then she told that when she is in the locker room changing for gym she checks l the girls out. She also said that she LIKES one of her best friends... She has a reputation as a slut but once I got to know her she wasn't really a slut until this happened. What should I do about the situation because I'm really not that comfortable with her checking chicks out. I only got two good things out of her telling me this, 1) We both have something in common lol (we both like girls) (2) Maybe we could have a three way or something with her friend. Please help or at least tell me if you would like it or don't even kind it. Thanks  ",

	{'answer': u'\nI used to do allot of the maintenance on my vehicles now I no longer have the tools to do any of it along with the knowledge to fix things - bothers me.          \nYes...lots of things..but I take one day at a time.          \nOh yes. Assembly required to me now is changing the toilet paper roll.          \nI used to remove trees & grind strumps out.I don\'t want to even think about it lol          \nNot too many years ago I grew and cut my own firewood. Now when I go to cut a pesky little low hanging branch I can barely lift the same chainsaw. I also used to clean out a chimney stack. But there\'s no way now I\'m getting up onto the roof and I no longer like ladders and heights.          \nI\'m still very ambitious, but I lack the stamina to accomplish my ambitions.  This is something of a daily crisis for me, and I can\'t figure out what to do about it.  It can be quite depressing.          \nI still can do most things, my biggest problem is getting onto my knees and trying to get back up!          \nI was at the doctor\'s office today and there was a little girl sitting across from me. I watched as she bent over and worked on her feet and toes and I thought about how I had been able bend that way, once. Now I get dizzy just getting up on a chair, if I can make it onto the chair, and look up at the ceiling fan to see if the switch is turned to summer. I can\'t get outside now with the heat, but I wonder if I\'ll still be able to get out once the temperature cools.          \nI do okay if I don\'t have to get down on my knees and back up again or stoop for very long. \r\n \r\nI own a dustpan on a stick.  I have a knee pad and a stool for getting up again if I must kneel down in my garden.  I used to bend over an mop my bathroom floor.  Now I toss the damp cloth on the floor and swoosh it around with my barefoot.  I don\'t like those Swiffer mops. \r\n \r\nHave you tried doing things in small steps?  This has helped me a lot.  If I were to paint a room, (several months ago) it took me a whole week.  I could work at it for about an hour and that was it.  Primed, then color paint walls, then corners, then the trim.  My son did the ceiling for me first.  (Bless his little heart). \r\n \r\nI gotta admit.  I\'m not into do-it-your-self as I used to be.          \nI am only 53 but have felt like I was going to die several years ago. I think it is good I went through that cause I learned that many things that seem to take over the body just need to be worked on. I really stayed in bed sick for many years. So I had to get my health back on my own. With low energy and not being able to think I found that if I noticed my breathing I started to think better. If I ate certain foods such as those that have protein I could think better. If I drank water.So I changed all of these things and I am still working on improving.  \r\n \r\nThere is so much info. we can use but we have been taught to put our faith in the drug companies, doctors who work for the drug companies and religious institutions that make us feel healty but if we pay close attention they are actually filling us with fear not faith.  \r\n \r\nI started riding a stationary bike every night during Jeopardy but for the first year I couldn\'t stay on for a minute. I mean I really came from nothing to this recovery. I am still very much in recovey though.  \r\n \r\nI couldn\'t lift my arms without pain to wash my hair so my body really became weak. Now I exercise some then add more to what I do. I noticed I couldn\'t bend over or easily get up from the floor so those are things to add to a rountine.  \r\n \r\nWhatever someone finds the can\'t do they need to make into an exercise. If you can\'t pick up a 20 lb. chain saw find something in your house that weighs that much and put it in your bathroom. Everytime you go take a tinkle it will remind you to lift it up a couple times then after doing that for a week do it more and add more.  \r\n \r\nI thought I was a victim and I still have a lot of that going on. I just found out something bad about someone who won\'t listen so I have to focus on what I know about not fixing others. So I am working at all of this but I know the alternative is not better.          \nI have a room that needs painting and have not painted a room for 10 years, so we shall see just how easy or not it is.  At least it is a small room, 11x12 or there about, but the ceiling needs painting too.  Last several times I had furniture to put together the kids did it for me in a short amount of time.  I just helped some friends move a couple weeks ago, sweated and worked for 8 hours.  You\'d be surprised what the body can do when it needs to.  It can go way beyond what one thinks...          \nHello Dear Lona!   I just got up off the sofa about thirty minutes ago!  I let out a low moan of pain getting up, this is an every day thing!  What has happended to my body?  Yes I have always been fat, but I have always worked hard, and had a lot of energy, and never any pain! \r\nNow I am tried, my knees hurt when I get up, I have no energy for new tasks! \r\nI have done so much today, shopping and decorating my bathroom, "it looks very nice" but I am so tried! \r\nI am shocked that I am old...63, but today , I feel 83! \r\nI hope I wake up tomorrow feeling 40!          \nI have a hard time getting down to do my garden work and get back up with out turning around and pushing myself back up.  The funny thing is that I can still kick my butt.          \nin the bath, I  have not had a bath for several years.I could get in but not out,have to have help.no problem with a shower except my left foot          \nYes, we all slow down as we get older. This is a fundamental truth of aging..          \nWeed-eating is not good for me, the vibration makes my back draw up. I push a lawn mower easier than stand there and weed-eat.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    yard work and putting things together, painting a room . When they start to do what they have always done they can no longer do it so easily and are shocked that they can't. I've ALWAYS been able to paint a room and now it just seems too difficult or have I lost interest as I've aged? \r\n \r\n about a year or so ago I put some furniture together and now I find I just don't want to buy any thing that says  : ASSEMBLY REQUIRED.

	{'answer': u'\nI don\'t use a list unless there\'s something specific that I want to make and I need to get the ingredients for it. I\'m not a senior, though...          \nAbsolutely!  Or I would forget what I really need.          \nI do.The list keeps me from making expensive impulse purchases.          \nWe make  lists, not because we think we will forget everything --but because we know that we will forget at least one item, if we don\'t. \r\n \r\nPS : In supermarkets, why can\'t women think, and push shopping trolleys sensibly , at the same time ?.          \nI very seldom make a list since I will end up leaving it at home any way.  I\'m one of those people who would forget their head if it wasn\'t attached.          \nI always have a shopping list going. I keep a narrow pad of paper attached to my refrigerator by a magnet; and add things to my shopping list as I notice that I\'m running low. When my children still lived at home the rule was if it isn\'t on the list, then mom would not buy it (this \'rule\' still holds for my husband). I find that if I write down my list and review it, then I remember to get what I need even when I forget my list.  \r\n \r\nI do \'improvise\' with my food shopping; shop partly from my list and partly by whim. I first go to either a Farmer\'s Market or produce market; and pick out fruit, veggies, cheese, and eggs that look the freshest and cost the least. Then I shop for things to go with the fruit and veggies.  \r\n \r\nFor me, it isn\'t shopping from my list that prevents me from over-spending; my trick is to eat before I shop. Shopping while hungry has caused me to load up on snacks and other items that I don\'t need...;)          \nYes, I do Lily and without it, I do over buy. It leaves me feeling as though I am forgetting something important if I leave the list. So, I try to remember to always take the list which is more sensible than the things I buy on a whim.          \nI have always made a list for supermarket shopping.   Simply because I find those places so boring.  I just want to get in and out as quick as possible so I can go do some real shopping.   A list lets me go straight to the aisles I need to then get right back out. \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nI always make a list and stick to it, very rarely buying anything not on the list. \r\n \r\nThe supermarkets hate customers like me as a lot of their profits come from impulse buying.          \nI make a list and only buy what on my list..I always put my list right on top of my purse and when ready to leave I put that list in my jeans pockets so it is with me at all times..but sometime I will lose my list while I am at the store though..only once in awhile will I buy something that is not on my list, if I see something cute to buy for my grandsons that is..=).          \nI make lists for everything...or would spend my time backtracking all the day....or coming home having forgotten something.     \n \nBecause I try to save $$ any way possible....I will usually map out how I am going to run my "route" to accomplish the things on my list before I leave the house. \n \nYes,  my shopping list is subject to change if I run into a great markdown item...or unadvertised store special. \n \nPS.   Was just reading through my list for today...and noticed I nearly forgot one item on it....To wish everyone in the Seniors Section...Happy Valentine Day!!    Without my list,  I would have forgotten to do it...          \nBeing on a budget, I plan menus for a couple weeks at a time, making sure to either use or freeze leftovers later.  I\'ve got a list on the refrigerator so I don\'t forget items which are in need of restocking. The stores LOVE it when people don\'t make lists and they have all sorts of expensive goodies in every aisle to entice.          \nI attended a seminar when I was about to retire and the one thing I remember was always write things down,so yes, we make a shopping list,needless to say we sometimes forget it. I am the best for shopping if given a list I buy what is on it and that is that,my wife goes down every aisle in the super market.          \nI keep a list handy and add to it when I think of something,I do a lot of projects around the house so I also make a list when I need something from the hardware store.          \nYes--- \nwithout a list I would remember around 3  out of 20 things I need . \n  \nI write things down in groups of where they are and stuff in front of the store on top and the bottom of the list is for items in the back of the store. \n \nHowever, I also buy stuff not on my list, especially when I am hungry  ;-)          \noh yes, i have notes for every-thing pinned all over the place, although i do my shopping online i make a list just the same. ive got so bad ive even stuck a note on my fridge reminding me to clean it !!!!!!!          \nNo. I hate making lists. I just walk slowly down the aisles and pick whatever I need.          \nI only have a list for those items I absolutely have to remember to replenish. All others I pick up I try to get "on sale" or "discounted". I have even gone so far as to only buy those meats that have been reduced in price because they are close to their best by dates, or those that are on at good sale prices to draw customers....when you are feeding 7 people--all of whom are big meat eaters--it can get very expensive otherwise!          \nHi Lily. Yes, I make out a list before grocery shopping. Otherwise, like you, I will spend more. Sometimes even with a list, I see something I failed to put down, that I know I need. I also make my list out by the grocery sale bill, and take advantage of those sale items, IF I need them.          \nI Always write out a shopping list to do my weekly grocery shop.  If I didn\'t I wouldn\'t remember half the things I wanted. \r\nI have a terrible memory and even write down 2 or 3 things like bread, milk, papers.          \nI write a shopping list. \r\n \r\nI write a menu plan for the week too.          \nA shopping list is imperative to me. I don\'t like to spend time wandering about deciding what to eat for the next week. Since I can no longer drive, I try very hard to keep my pet food stocked.I keep my pantry stocked with all the things I may need for the weeks food preparation. The essentials such as paper towels, toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, whatever else. \r\n \r\nIt was because I do that I did not find myself with hungry pets, or a meatloaf I couldn\'t finish making because I didn\'t have all the ingredients during our brief "lock down" due to weather. \r\n \r\nI sure admire the people who live for instance in North Dakota  who know how to maintain their larder!          \nI make a list, jotting down stuff over the weeks time,  then if it\'s long,  I rewrite it putting things in sections like the grocery store.   Otherwise,  I\'d still forget half of it!     Probably one of the main things that keeps me making the same foods over and over.   I can\'t remember to put new ingrediants on the list.   Let alone buy them! \r\n \r\nI\'m able to steer my shopping cart ok,   but when the guy asks me \'plastic or paper\',  I never hear him.   I\'m so busy trying to remember what I forgot!   \r\nHappy Valentines Day to you too Ms. Minerva!  And everyone.          \nI do use a list.  We live 15 miles from the stores.  If I forget to buy something I need, it\'s a lot of gas to go back to the store for it.Can\'t depend on my memory these days.   Also, without a list, I buy several things I don\'t need.          \nYes...I like to take inventory of what I already have and then check my coupons...then \'map\' out my meal plan for the week, then make the list accordingly... \r\n \r\n..helps to keep me from accidentally over spending or buying stuff I already have.          \nWe tend to list first & then embellish while strolling down aisles.          \nThroughout one day I am making a shopping list for the next day.  I go shopping for just a few things each day because I don\'t drive and cannot carry too much weight.  As I think about something we are running short of I just jot it down.  The next morning I look at my list and decide which ones I need for that day (and considering the weight of the items) then decide what can be left for tomorrow or ever later. \r\n \r\nSometimes I forget my list and leave in on the kitchen table but, because I went to the effort of writing it down, I usually remember them because the action of writing seems to leave an imprint on my brain .  That function of my brain isn\'t quite as good as it used to be though.  I used to have a list of maybe 16 to 20 items and would still remember them (if I forgot the list) and in the same order than they were written on the paper.  I could see the list in my mind - if you know what I mean.   \r\nOh, those were the days.  I think 5 items is about my limit now. \r\n \r\nAs I age I am becoming more careful in what I buy.  I use up left-overs (hate throwing ANY food away) and have become very inventive in using up small amounts of several things - adding something fresh if necessary to stretch the bits into a meal. \r\n \r\nI buy bulk when there are really good offers on but have to rely on a friend or relative with a car to do that. I have enough storage space to take whole cases of cans or jars if necessary and that can save a lot of money.          \ni usually make a list of things I need and mustnt forget \r\nthen i usually walk out of the house without it          \nYes, when I go shopping for my wife she always has a list made out.  The strange thing about it is I often come home to find I had forgotten something on the list.  I take a pen with me so I can scratch off the items as I place them in the cart but I still find a way to forget something.  Isn\'t becoming elderly fun and challenging?  :o)          ',
	 'question': u'\n    or do you buy whatever takes your fancy at the time? \r\n \r\nI usually make a list of sorts but I invariably forget it and have to buy on a whim or what I feel needs replenishing in the cupboards. \r\n \r\nI also find that I spend more without my list and in these lean times I could well do with remembering it. \r\n \r\nSo do you need or bother with a shopping list?

Bret Hart was a technical wizard, simply one of the best, but who can forget the Dynamite Kid, a man who revolutionized the juniors? Dynamite Kid for me. \r\n \r\nRandy Savage here. He was arguably the best WWF worker of the 1980s, and even brought Ultimate Warrior to a great match. \r\n \r\nThe Rabid Wolverine manages to take this one out of his best friend\'s grip. \r\n \r\nI have a feeling that everybody\'s going to pick the massively overrated Angle, but I don\'t care. It\'s the King of Harts for me. \r\n \r\nDamn, Eddie didn\'t take it? Ah well, as consolation, we get a match between arguably the two best drawing wrestlers in WWE history. While it would be a terrible match today and both men\'s egos would never allow it to happen, no doubt this match could potentially draw like crazy. The Rattlesnake wins. \r\n \r\nA great match, but I\'ve got to give it to Michaels. \r\n \r\nBach. The Rock could work a crowd, but Ric Flair could work a crowd AND wrestle.

As I said before, if he couldn\'t out-wrestle you he\'d out-fight you.  If he couldn\'t out-fight you, he\'d out-"crazy" you. \r\n \r\nBret Hart.  Hate to see Dynamite leave so soon, but the Hitman would just out-wrestle him and make him tap to the Sharpshooter. \r\n \r\nSting.  A little better wrestler than Savage, I think.  Sting would win by submission to the Scorpion Deathlock. \r\n \r\nChris Benoit.  Damn...what a match-up!  Chris\' strength advantage would be the difference here.  Dean would eventually tap to the Crippler Crossface. \r\n \r\nKurt Angle.  As great as Owen was, so is Kurt.  Kurt\'s meaner and more ferocious.  No submission here, Kurt would just have to wear Owen out and pin him. \r\n \r\nHulk Hogan.  Hogan CAN wrestle.  He\'s bigger and stronger than Austin, too. \r\n \r\nThe Undertaker.  Shawn\'s good, real good.  I just think the Undertaker can beat him. \r\n \r\nRic Flair.  Flair had no trouble out-wrestling the big guys.  The Rock would be no different.          ',

	 'question': u'\n    An extraordinarily handsome man decided he had the God-given responsibility to marry the perfect woman so they could produce children beyond comparison. \r\n \r\nWith that as his mission he began searching for the perfect woman. After a diligent, but fruitless, search up and down the east coast, he started to head west. Shortly thereafter he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them. \r\n \r\nThe farmer simply replied, "They\'re all lookin\' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look them over and select the one you want." \r\n \r\nThe man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man\'s opinion. \r\n"Well" said the man, " She\'s just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed." \r\n \r\nThe farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter. \r\n \r\nThe next day, the farmer again asked how things went. \r\n"Well," the man replied, "She\'s just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell, cross-eyed." \r\n \r\nThe farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did. \r\n \r\nThe next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, "She\'s perfect, just perfect! She\'s the one I want to marry!" So they were wed right away. \r\n \r\nMonths later the baby was born. When the man visited nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the parents. \r\n \r\n"Well," explained the farmer, "She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell, pregnant when you met her."

	{'answer': u'\nNot to sound cliche, but I try to go by the "golden rule"--treating others the way I want to be treated. As long Yankee fans aren\'t totally and completely disrespectful to me, I\'m fine with them. But if they go beyond the "Red Sox suck" insults, I get a little annoyed and defend my team. Otherwise, I\'ve had conversations with Yankee fans numerous times at Fenway Park and they were (mostly) all very classy and polite. \r\n \r\nEdit: People throw out ridiculous insults online because they\'re behind a computer screen. They have time to plan what they\'re going to say and come up with clever comebacks. I bet that 90% of the kids on Y!A wouldn\'t say the things they type to someone\'s face. They feel safe because they know that they\'ll never meet anyone they\'re conversing with on Y!A. I don\'t know about you, but I find that a bit pathetic. I know there\'s a saying that goes, "If you wouldn\'t write it and sign it, don\'t say it." Well, I think in the online world, it\'s the other way around.          \nfight and insult the yankee fans....i respect all other fans though \r\n...in response to your additional details there are ALOT of fights at yankees sox games dont know what games you go to/what teams you watch          \nI try to be as courteous as possible, but there\'s a limit to my kindness.  I\'m not gonna sit their and let some little punk talk crap about my team without joining in.  For the most part, I haven\'t had many problems, but there have been a few altercations.  The most notable being between me and my friends, and some Indian fans.  All I\'m going to say is there was more than a couple bloody noses. =] \r\n \r\nBut aside from a couple times, I\'ve had some pretty decent conversations with fans from other teams.  In San Diego, it\'s pretty much like this:  Padres Fans, Red Sox Fans, and Yankee Fans.  I\'ve had pleasant conversations with most of them and they actually proved out to be quite knowledgeable. \r\n \r\nEDIT:  Wooh! The first thumb down!  Hopefully, the first of many more!          \nTreat all fans with respect. This nonsense can get out of hand and WE all must remember not to have our athletic events - pro and amateur - degenerate into soccer "riots" reported on in many spots throughout the world.          \nYou had your face on the big screen? LOL LOL you are toooo funny,and brave.I really treat the rival\'s that come to yankee stadium pretty good,i just like to go to the games and have fun.          \nFlush them down the toilet see if they enjoy it          \nI\'m a San Diego Padres fan our rivals are the Dodgers. those dodger fans love to fight, always talking crap when were there to see a game (giants, rockies, & d-back fan not as much). the funny thing is if you go to Chargers games, those same dodger fan are raider fans & they talk even more crap & they love to fight even more (Bronco & Chief fans not as more too). we don\'t treat them bad, it just they love to fight, & we San Diego people don\'t take crap from anyone, so why don\'t you guys go back to L.A. & stay there!          \nNot much though I\'ve never gotten tiks to a SSox game living in NY.However many friends are Yankee fans so there are more heated arguments there for instance \r\n \r\nFriend: Hey Boston su+ks \r\n \r\nMe: Yeah we do suck. hey whatday are the WS Rings coming in.  \r\n \r\nF: Yeah whatever Yanks rock (yeah right) \r\n \r\nM: Yeah by the way asjk Jeter hoe the golf courses are in October \r\n \r\nF: Yeah 26 rings \r\n \r\nM: What have they done lately \r\n \r\nF: Luck \r\n \r\nM: Yeah cuz luck always beats a roidfiled 350million dollar lineup \r\n \r\nF: Wait til next yr \r\n \r\nM: Yeah I can watch another WS win \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHowever for strangers its not further than a Yanks suck. And liek some have said there are intelligent.          \nI really don\'t treat other fans rude because my mom, who\'s very strict, is there. If I was there with just my friends than I would go loose. As a Yankees fan I believe that Sox fans take it over the top when it comes to treating other team fans. U got balls to do that stuff.          \nI\'ve been to several different ballparks.  With the exception of Phili the home fans treated the visitors with the same respect the visitors showed.  Once in Baltimore I actually saw an Oriole fan catch a foul ball.  He was an older man.  He then turned around and handed it to a little girl wearing a Red Sox cap.  Class like that isn\'t typical.  But usually it\'s almost never physical or rude. \r\nNow a friend of mine lives in Oakland and has Raider tickets.  According to him.  It\'s enemy colors.  And those people tend to get beer spilled on them and sometimes even completely ignored by the vendors.          \nnot livin` in the US anymore but i`d love to kick some dodger`s asses at AT&T when i see some dirty scenes on youtube          \nThe same way they would treat me, if I was in the rival team\'s ballpark.          \nWith respect.          \nnice question. \r\nlol im a yankee fan and have atteneded red sox games. \r\nunless they come out of their face and make a stupid comment about the yankees which one fan did, its pretty fun you hear guys screaming go back to beantown get some clam chow-da imitating a boston accent. i think it depends on how you act. \r\nbut i respect them until like one fan who looked up at the above crowd and said hey yankees suck. \r\nhe had bottles and stuff thrown at him.  \r\n \r\n-you have got some guts dude. my friend was trying to get me to go to shea wearing my a-rod jersey and boo the mets but thats disrespectful. \r\n \r\ngo yankees!  \r\np.s. keep going to sox games in yankee blue          \nI make it a point to be respectful -- I would want to be treated that way if I went to a visiting ballpark.          \nI liek to ask them questions. They probably think I\'m weird---hey, I\'m a weird guy, I don\'t deny it! I just ask them questions on their team that take opinions. We always seem to get stuck by Tigers fans. When I was at The Cell vd. the Orioles in 2006, there were some Tigers fans there for some odd reason. But they were very polite and I liked them. I have a lot of relatives from Michigan so I see Tigers fans a lot. Plus, they are baseball fans and came to support their team. Why get mad?          \nI have been in Angels Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Yankee Stadium, Petco Park and whatever the name is of that sauna in Miami in Red Sox gear.  Everyone treats you with respect/ignores you, except the Yankee fans.  There is just too much history there.  It makes it fun.   \r\nAs for your experience, I could never understand why a Yankee fan would show up at Fenway for  a Red Sox--Tigers game in Yankee gear.  Wear Tiger gear for Heaven\'s sake.  Of course you are going to be the most loathed person in the park.   \r\nActually wearing a Yankee hat in the City of Boston is not the brightest of moves as a general matter.          \nwell I don\'t get upset with people unless they they argue with me and don\'t know what they are talking about. I don\'t mind talking or even arguing with fans from the opposing team as long as the are knowlegable baseball fans, and aren\'t rude. I would much rather talk with one of my fellow Phillies fans.          \ni let them enjoy the game until they become idiots. i travel to games but respect that i am an outsider, i don\'t get in faces when my team does well or wins. i hate when fans come into your team\'s house & get stupid & when they do, they get knocked down a notch.          \nI only went to one game to see the Red Sox at Fenway, and the only "rival" I saw near was my dad, and he was wearing a Mets jersey, when the Red Sox were playing the A\'s. So, I was nice to him...seeing as that he was my ride home, and I wanted some cotton candy. Haha.          \ni hate when them da.mn mets fans invade philly, theyre rude, lazy and obnoxious. at a game last year a mets fan proposed to his girlfriend and they showed it up on the bigscreen at citizens bank park, then all of a sudden the entire stadium started to boo them.          \nI think it depends... As a Braves fan, I don\'t remember seeing a lot of crap when I did get to go to games.  I noticed that people just let the other fans do their thing. \r\n \r\nI\'ve found that living up north, it\'s a little more brutal.          \nEverytime I go to Tampax Park in San Francisco wearing my blue hat, I get stuff thrown at me (mostly because the Dodgers usually win) because Giants fans are among the most pathetic and classless I\'ve ever seen. I guess it\'s tough having an empty trophy case. When I\'m in Los Angeles, there are hardly ever any Giants fans there, so there\'s no point. Maybe they don\'t want to drive 450 miles south just to watch their team lose. Can\'t blame them.          \nI treat them as nice and polite as possible unless there Dodger fans then I might not be as friendly...Haha          \nI don\'t harass anyone who cheers for the other team in my teams Stadium. I hope to get the same courtesy & respect when i go to Fenway park & Wrigley Field later this year.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    "Invade" might not be the best word to use, so feel free to fill in your own word (visit, attend, pilgrimage?).  I lived in Boston for a number of years, and have been to a bunch of games at Fenway (currently my second favorite ballpark).  Being a Yankees fan, I often wore my Yankees hat (and sometimes even a jersey - Mattingly, Jeter, or Ruth) to games, even when the Sox were not playing the Yankees.  Call me crazy, but that\'s how I roll (and I am not the only one).  Of course, I get booed, and people would make comments (i.e., "Yankees suck" or "Hey guy, did you take a wrong turn on I-95?").  I once even had my face put on the big screen so the whole stadium could boo me.  But, in general (other than a couple of knuckleheads), people were respectful and good-natured, and even defended me from those knuckleheads.  I noticed that Sox fans who come to Yankee Stadium with their gear, are also treated in similar fashion.  ',

	{'answer': u"\nWhat makes you think we don't get caught? \nThose of us in prison are always jailing criminals. \n \nThe Devil protects his own, he writes his own laws because he's busy writing his own book. \nHe points fingers at people are writes their obituaries.          \nNo. Stop being homophobic.  \n \nAlso, God created them, right? Homosexuality isn't a choice.          \nTo be honest, if I was god I would be more offended by your stupidity.          \nI've been a gay female since  conception. I know exactly how and why medically. I also know there is no one to blame. We may be in an estimated 20 %  of the global population, but many of us are very well educated, live normal lives, have same or similar interests to the straight community, and speaking of being caught, is it acceptable for straight humans to abuse children or spouses?          \n \n \n \n \nNo, but I think trolls like you are going to hell.          \nNot man, but God is the judge of our sins!          \nOh yes we gays should serve time so much time having sex and much more with the lover boyfriend you have until you fall asleep In each others arms          \nDo you think people claiming to be christian and displaying hate in the name of God witch is sin should be punished. \n \nDidn't think so.          \nKELS IS RIGHT!!!! \nHow dare Christians  attack gay people when there are paedophiles on the street. \nGod bothers will always continue to make themselves feel better by picking on others. \n \nIm not gay but if I was I would hate Christians actively. \n \nWhy don't Christians campaign against child molesters and rapists the way they do gays. \nReally says something about the religion and the people. \n \nP.S How would putting gay people away with each other change anything? :)          \nThey all must repent! \n \nLol just kidding I&#x27;m not religious and gays should be able to be with who they want, it doesnt bother me          \nwho ever created us intended a man and a women to be together to have kids, when one (male or female ) like the same sex its not natural but god created them so i compare them to mentally challenged person. they cant help it, its not there fault, but are just as smart as the next person. so no you dont lock up retards for being retarded          \nDont worry about it! Its just simply none of your business it doesn&#x27;t affect you in any way so seriously if you don&#x27;t have anything nice to say dont say it! I&#x27;m bisexual and 100% proud! Am I going to hell? Let god decide not you boo ok? Think what you want I have an amazing heart I don&#x27;t steal I volunteer I help people any way I can I didn&#x27;t choose to be this way I just am and if I&#x27;m going to hell for loving the love of my life then so be it IDC its my life don&#x27;t worry if I do or not be worried if your going to hell for judging people and trying to be god! Just stop with your homophobia!          \nWell first of all, I support gay marriage and have nothing against gay people. But that's not the issue here. \nYou ask me should gay people serve time for sinning. So I assume we establish the idea that homosexuality is bad. The question then is how bad is it. \n \nWell, why is it bad in the first place? Is it because it's unnatural, because the Bible or another religious book forbids it or because of another reason? \nI'll consider these in that order. \n \n1) It is bad because it is unnatural \nFact: there is no gay gene. There can't be one after hundreds and millions and millions of years of evolution. Scientists look for a way how DNA is 'expressed' (let's leave all the genetical stuff out of this) for the source of homosexuality. \nAnother fact is that you are not born gay. There is an easy proof of this (and it is directly related to the first issue of the 'gay gene'), which is the experiment with identical twins. This study has been carried out since the beginning of the 90s and is done over and over again with the same results. When looking at identical twins, a small percentage (~10%) has different sexual preferences. By that I mean that one is gay and the other is straight. \nIf you are born gay or straight, that percentage shouldn't be there. But it is. This means that some lifestyles and upbringings of children are more likely to 'induce' (if that is the right word) homosexuality. \nBut these are not the only facts. Homosexual intercourse is seen in the wild when looking at mammals. Primates, buffalo's, bats you name it. These participate in homosexual intercourse whenever they feel like it. There are many reasons for this, but it's almost never because they are gay (mistake the partner for female, desire for sex or whatever). These animals are actually bisexual and not gay. \n \nSo gayness is a disorder that is present in almost all mammals. It's uncommon, but not something that is only seen when looking at humans. This makes the argument of unnaturalness rather weak, if you ask me. But I leave it up to you how to interpret this. But even if there is a biological reason that gayness is unnatural, that doesn't mean it is bad. A Bose-Einstein condensate is not seen in nature, yet we can create one in laboratories using lasers to cool atoms. Lasers are based on stimulated emission through population inversion of the electrons. That's also unnatural but that doesn't mean it's unethical. \n \nCombining ethics with biology easily becomes a national socialist thing, so I would like to leave it at this. My conclusion is that homosexuality is bad because it's unnatural is just not that such a strong argument. \n \n2) Because the Bible forbids it (or any other religious book) \nI'm gonna go ahead and say you live in the USA. The treaty of Tripoli states very clearly that the US government is not based on any religion (and Christianity in particular). If you live in any other country, the argument usually still holds. All western countries are secular, meaning that religion has no law giving or enforcing power. It does not mean that religion as an institution is illegal, it means that the government does not practice religion and does not use it in the profession of its labours. \nActually, most of Western civilization is based on Napoleonic laws. \nThe highest law is thus that of the country, not that of religion. But if we say that you live in a non-secular country (Pakistan, Iran, Egypt) where religion does have lawful power, any punishment on homosexuality should be as described in the scriptures that religion is based on. Does it say death by stoning? Then stone them to death. Does it say '20 dollar fine'? A 20 dollar fine it is. \nSo prison is not suitable solution here either. But because gay people are still people, you might consider a more humane approach. In that case, prison is a way to go. \n \nSo that is what the arguments are build on. If the first argument (that of unnatural behaviour) still holds for you, I would consider a punishment such as sterilization. They act unnatural so they must be sterilized. But since gayness has little genetical basis and more psychological basis, imprisonment in a mental institution seems more appropiate to me. \n \nIf the second argument works for you, I would say that the punishment given should be the one as given by the scripture. If it does not have a punishment for it, I would go for a punishment that is also given by a crime of similar seriousness. \n \nThis is what I think at least          \nReligion is a form of mental illness.  Why would you ask such a question when god is already punishing straight people for sinning against god.  They were the first to sin and were kicked out of the garden of eden.  Straight people are the first sinners.  They started it all.          ",

	{'answer': u'\nI certainly don\'t think the teacher\'s actions were proper. I would be calling the teacher to discuss and if you can\'t solve it, talk to the principal.          \nThe push to raise funds is the culprit. I would see this teachers immediate superior and report this behavior because it puts undue stress on a child\'s life.          \nlife isnt fair gramps. i thought all your knowledge and wisdom as an elder would have made you realise that          \nYou can put the fake names down if you want as long as those names produce the money needed for your grandaughter to turn in at school.That is not fair. I think it should be on a volunteer basis only. I would probably call the school to complain.          \nI almost fell into that trap, but I used a better name \r\n \r\nMr. Nowonz Gonapae \r\n \r\nI sure would find out from the Principals office what this is about.Who knows, it might be something for just the Teacher.There is nothing more useless and expensive than Magazine Subscriptions!              Good Luck!          \nif that is what the teacher meant, no it isn\'t fair--my granddaughter told me the same thing and come to find out she misunderstood what the teacher meant--her teacher meant name, address, telephone no etc. (whatever the info called for ) because these were magazine subscriptions and not food\\item orders.          \nfirst i would ascertain that the details are correct -- if so - i would give the form back to the teacher and tell her to put it where the sun does not shine -- then i would make an apporintment with the school board and inquire if they knew what was going on in there school -- i also would explain to the grand daugher exactly what was going on and i would also make it up to her for being brave and backing my actions!!!          \nThat\'s real pressure on your granddaughter, and I would be going to see the Head never mind the teacher. Its not on at all.          \nHi ol\'geezer, \r\n \r\nPersonally I\'d go to the school principal & or superintendent of schools & have a  discussion with him/her about sending children door to door in today\'s society to sell magazines, gift wrap, candy, pizza\'s or any other kinda fund-raiser\'s.    Ask what gives the teacher the right to demand this of your granddaughter then punish her for not getting any orders.  What are the school policies  If the school wants money that bad hold a school event where parents donate their time, have a brazzar, bake sale,  donate unused items from home for an auction, like a carnival-cake walks, fishing pond, bean bag throw, eat dinner at the school function using tickets with allot amounts, sell used books cheap,  ice cream social, dunk tank for the teacher\'s & principal. \r\nNo I find this objectionable to say the least. Good luck & have a good  day. :0) \r\nAdditional Details: had children in school,  have grandchildren, get involved, support  the school. Ban all fund-raiser\'s.          \nI would contact the teacher to ensure that what you heard was what the teacher intended. If not, no harm just a simple request for additional info. If the teacher affirms that your grand-daughter is correct, then I\'d be making some complaints-to the Principal of the school, to the Superintendent of the school district, and to the members of the school board. If the teacher didn\'t return my attempts to reach her or him, then I\'d complain to the Prinicipal and work my way up the food chain if needed. \r\n \r\nSchools, and after school programs (like Little League or dance schools) can be relentless with their fundraising efforts. I always set a limit on how much I\'ll \'donate\' each year and stick to it, no matter what. I\'ve only complained once, in a situation similar to what you are dealing with....and the teacher \'changed her tune\' about kids who don\'t sell a specified amount for her chorus not getting to participate in a fun activity.          \nyou lot above !!...its fund raising...dont be soooooo mean !!!.................................and you lot below !!          \nThat is blackmailing your grandchildand you, that is outrageous, it should be illegal to do that, unless you are to fill it out ONLY if you intend to purchase the mags..Take it to the school board, the principle, call child protective services about it, call the police, write a letter to the editor, call your local TV news station.  Get a lawyer as a last result.          \nTell the kid to just say "NO" to all dealers.          \nThat is not only unfair it is totally inappropriate. I just send them back the same day with a note that my son and I do not solicit friends and family.          \nYet another reason my kid was homeschooled.  The public school systems fails to account for the fact that some kids are in public school because it\'s the only option available to the family...if they could afford to buy magazines and chocolate at $2 a bar for a $1 candy bar, the kid would probably be in private school. \r\n \r\nWhen my older children were in public school, I remember the tears they shed because they couldn\'t sell whatever the latest fund-raising item was ... we lived in the ghetto as it was the only rent we could afford at the time and every other kid in the neighborhood was pushing the same product. \r\n \r\nI agree with whomever posted, just say "NO" to all pushers.          \ntake your mop when you go....just make sure your granddaughter heard it right first.          \nExtortion          \nFund raisers should always be voluntary. How sad for children who\'s families can\'t afford to contribute to be punished. This is not fair and the principal should be informed. The teacher in this case is in the wrong.          \nI would go have a serious talk with the teacher, the principle and the Superintendant.  I would be pissed off big time.  They would not do that to my child! I would go to hell and back before it was over with.          \nI have bought subscriptions from my grandchildren many different times.  Each time the child received a reward. \r\nThere was never a threat involved.          \nIt\'s not fair - but know this ..sometimes kids come home and say anything in order to "compete" . If you complain at school , you may find out that your little darling embellished  the story a little , in order to sell the most - OR - you will succeed in bringing negative attention to your  grand daughter .  \r\n   If , in fact teacher did say something like that - kids misinterpret a lot anyhow - so give her the benefit of the doubt .It can\'t be easy with some 30 kids in one room all day ..and it\'s probably for a good cause . The kid wants to look good in front of her peers . Sometimes trying to help - we can make them look bad .          \nGet this straightened out ASAP..Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding on someones part. \r\n \r\nI\'ll like to know how this turns out if possible.          \nSometimes, facts get a little mixed up on their way home... Just so the teacher was aware that the child wasn\'t making up excuses, I\'d send a note back with the child stating that he/she wouldn\'t be participating ------------ if indeed there is any further mention of punishment, I\'d be at the school raising royal conniption fits.          \nThe only ones who win from this charade are the magazines.  They USE kids to peddle their junk then give them trashy \'prizes.\'  I\'d have that teacher up against the wall and tell HER to go hustle magazines. \r\nI remember when we were given these magazines to sell.  I threw mine in the trash the first time.  I didn\'t feel bad about not selling ANY subscriptions.  What a RIP OFF.  I thought the schools had dropped that nonsense by now.  But, stupid is  as stupid does.  \r\nYou do realize that in most fund raisers, the recipient only gets 5% to 15% of the funds raised? \r\nAsk the teacher how much the school gets out of every dollar taken in.  Does the teacher even KNOW?  Probably not. \r\nSounds like someone needs to attend some PTA meetings and make their voice heard.          \nI\'m sure as I can be, you love you\'re grand daughter. In you\'re mind, everything that comes out of her mouth is gospel. But,,, the best of kids,, don\'t always tell the truth... Don\'t mean to lead anyone to think , there\'s not some  brain dead teachers .... Talking to that teacher seems like a good idea.. If that don\'t do it,,, the Mickey Mouse thingie sounds good... THEN   See what the school board thinks.........          \nConfront the teacher directly with a question, an open-ended question, one which the teacher can\'t answer with a "yes or no". For example: What happens if my child couldn\'t find a relative or friend to order a magazine?  \r\nIf this is the case and the teacher has threatened the child\'s recess, then a trip to the Principal\'s office is warranted. \r\nI just so happened to contact the school 2 of my Grandchildren attend. The parents filled out the magazine forms for both children. While talking to the Principal, she informed me that she doesn\'t like the magazine fundraiser because the school will see very little of the funds. She told me she feels the fundraiser is a rip off. I asked her why the classroom teacher was participating then, but she didn\'t have an answer. \r\nChildren cannot be forced to fill out these forms or return them.  \r\nI have destroyed countless order forms and envelopes that my Grandchildren brought home.  \r\nThe representative of the company usually sells the children at an Assembly-so the children come home revved up, ready to sell-for the cheap $store prize. I generally just donate a check to the child\'s school for a worthwhile project.  \r\nOf course, you don\'t have to do that either. I would rather just give a check than receive worthless or overpriced fundraising items.          \nGood for you.......That\'s something I would have done. \r\n \r\nDamned if I\'d let the fund-raising nazis intimidate me or my child/grandchild. \r\n \r\nIf they want to raise money, have a bake sale.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    My 8 year old grand daughter came home from school last Friday, with an order form for magazines. (a "fund-raiser".) She told us, that her teacher, told her, that  it MUST be filled out COMPLETELY,(12 order\'s), or she would have to  miss  two recess session\'s. (sit in the classroom.) \r\n Do you think this is "fair"? What would YOU do in this case? (I don\'t WANT, or NEED, any magazines, and I\'m tempted to fill it out, and use fake names. e.g., Mickey mouse, Donald Duck, etc.)  ',

	{'answer': u'\nI would probably just look at them like they were nuts and walk away.          \nMy first reaction would just be to swing at them if they really wanted to fight me. But lets be honest who really wanna fight me?          \nLeo- would take that offer \r\n \r\nSagittarius-would probably do it JUST to shut that a**hole/b*tch the hell up!(I\'d rather piss them off til the make the first hit, that way You go to jail AND u get F*cked Up! double whammy, "hey officer it was self-defense"*shrugs*" \r\n \r\nVirgo- ignore them,wouldn\'t take the disrespect for long and would lash out. \r\n \r\nScorpio-Would be looking at how stupid this is, but with all the disrespect it\'s only a matter of time be4 they get involved          \nI don\'t argue because it\'s a front and waste of time. I\'m not the one to street fight because i\'ve actually trained in boxing. Train one day in a boxing gym and you\'ll see yourself that people have no idea how to fight.  \r\n \r\nLEO          \nI\'m Cancer I would start visibly shaking ,try and keep my cool and just walk off....but then when out of sight RUN from that lunatic!          \nI\'d just laugh at them \r\n \r\n \r\nScorpio          \nCancer or Sagittarians would Swing at em, if there was reasonable cause. \r\nScorpio or Pisces would swing at em no matter what. \r\nGemini would piss their pants and run in the opposite direction.          \nI dont like to back down from anyone trying to publicly act like the big man on campus.. \r\nso i would observe the situation, how big they are, if ive heard storoes of how many poepl theyd beat up.. if it looks bad ultimatley ill proabley say go ahead you swing if your so f*cking ready to f*ck me up, or are you all talk? \r\nthan i would wait and let them hit me first becuase if cops get involved its self defence if you fight back after they hit you. \r\ni live in the suburbs and if you back down or lose everyone knows about it in a week.. so to keep your rep unless its an obvious lose you fight back.. i know it sounds stupid and it really is but whatever its not going to change jsut get worse really.. theres nothign else to do so people party do drugs and fight.. i dont partake in all of it but its the way it is \r\nSource(s): \r\nim a libra sun and rising i like to keep the peace for sure, but if you start rumors aobut me or my friends to make things even they may get a punch to the face. \r\nMY cnacer friends would fight \r\nmy virgo femal friend never would in a million years \r\nvirgo male friends would without even thinking a second time \r\nmy saggitarius female and male friends would \r\naries both genders would \r\nmy aquarius male friends would females wouldnt \r\n... lo lim just going by the figths i know off and the people who backed down and the ones who never have          \ni would wet my pants and walk away shaking and cry later and then later think of how i could have totally beaten them up even though i know i wouldn\'t have done it.          \nI\'m a Gemini guy with who took sharp turns in morality every five years through out middle school to to college. \n-------------------------------------- \nMy Crazy Gemini\'s Answer]  \n \nChallenger: "Swing at me! I\'m ready to f-ck you up" \n \nThe anti-social, teenage, middle school and seriously violent me from the past would have leaned in and glared into the guy\'s eyes and I would\'ve dared him. \n \nMe: "How the **** do you plan on winning? I don\'t start fights but I\'ll end them and you\'re a god damn pussy that pisses me off. I\'ll kick your *** until you bleed from your ******* teeth." \n \nAs he\'d hit me, I\'d be prepared to quickly recover and counter him tossing him down to the floor. I\'d then run up and quickly beginning stomping on his a few times. I\'d kneel down over him with my knees keeping his arms pinned down and beat him in the face. After long time, he\'d be less resistant and struggle less and this would probably take a while. If no one pulled me off of him then I would choke the guy until he was unconscious. I\'d then get up and kick him a few times and then leave. \n \nIf he walked away before starting a fight then I\'d simply sigh annoyed and stomped off. \n----------------------------------- \nMy Childish Gemini\'s Answer] \n \nChallenger: "Swing at me! I\'m ready to f-ck you up" \n \nWhen I was in high school, I was pretty much a jerk and a troll calming down with my violent attitude and I danced on the danger line knowing people couldn\'t reach me anymore. I\'d grin and taunt him and keep reminding him that they are witnesses on the scene. \n \nMe: "Ewww that is gross and you\'re sick!!! Just kidding but I really don\'t swing that way and I\'m sorry but you truly are forever alone." \n \nI\'d directly make a time out sign with my hands and then shush him before he spoke and I\'d motion over to the crowd of witnesses. \n \n"Now you see, I seriously don\'t have time for this and I mean that I\'d love to dance anytime but we wouldn\'t want me to whoop your *** beat red with a bunch of witnesses around now would we? Plus, I know you wouldn\'t to get a date in handcuffs or would you?" \n \nAs I\'d make cheaper reference to the police and pull out my cell phone as a good enough threat to leave. I\'d talk waving phone back and forth to taunt him as dialed 991 ready for a five minute fight. \n \n"Now scram buzz-kill, I\'m busy with a party to attend too and you\'re not invited! So walk away or you\'ll have five minutes in hell here before the police arrived to see your mangled body." \n \nHinting to darker mood and I knew how break a person bones in high school so maybe I was joking or still a little psycho. They usually walk away snarl as I waved bye bye and flipped them off leaving the scene. \n \nIf he tried to hit me then, I\'m move to side tripping him up and then I\'d the sit on him and sigh while waiting till he\'d calm down. I\'ll call my friends and talk to them why waiting for hours. Officially I was a jack-*** in high-school. \n---------------------------------------... \nMy Calm Gemini\'s Answer. \n \nChallenger: "Swing at me! I\'m ready to f-ck you up" \n \nIn College I was mellowed out and I didn\'t really "fight" people but, there were a lot of police calls. I\'d shoot down any resistance with common sense. Theses incidents only happened when was defending someone else. \n \nMe: "Look I\'m trying help you here because, I don\'t think you realize the sea of eyes watching you and swing  me or anyone else then it won\'t end well. You need to stop acting violent." \n \nI use to try to get them to calm down but most times people didn\'t listen. If hit me then I\'d then I\'d turn to the colder side of personality and I\'d restrained him use grabbing his arm, twisting it behind his back nearly popping it. I\'d proceed to pushing down my foot into the back of his leg to make his and kneel. \n \nOfficially I thought to learn self defense before College and this is where it came to use. I pushed him down on his side, holding his restrained arm that was now facing the ground and I knelt on one of his legs so he wouldn\'t kick. I asked someone to call the police because, my hands were tied and waited. \n \nI was still crazy as I use to be then I would\'ve snapped his arm and popped his legged. \n \nThe first and last two choices actually happened to me but, I was never a troll like the one in the middle. \n \nThat was me in all my sharp turns as a Gemini.          \nBefore they finish there sentence, I would have already obliterated them.          \nI&#x27;m a Taurus and I dont know how I would react to that          ',

	{'answer': u'\nthere are sharks in the ocean          \nTides, shallows, buoyage systems, waves, storms, coastguard etc. \r\n \r\nAll depends on just how big your "large lake" is!. Some people describe the Atlantic Ocean as "just across the pond".          \nBigger lakes could be much more dangerous than many areas of the ocean - particularly shallow ones.  But that is a gross generalisation. It comes down to the location, and the conditions at the time.  If your man has enough experience to be cautious, you should be fine.   \r\n \r\nMake sure the boat is well found, and that you have phone and radio communications working at all times - if you can talk to and be heard by Coastguard and similar marine services at all times you will be informed of any bad weather or hazards, and are only a shout from help should anything unfortunate occur. \r\n \r\nGood luck, and long life to both of you!          \nThere are two problems to consider: \r\n1. Navigation, it is not uncommon for the inexperienced boater to get lost at sea because they can not navigate by chart and compass. It only take a little in attention to loose sight of land and fog (or squalls) can come in quickly making line of sight navigation impossible. \r\n2. It is an ocean, and as a result the waves can be much bigger. Over confidence in a boat will kill and those who do not respect the sea, die at sea. As others have said "The ocean is a tough mistress and none can tame her!" \r\nIt would be best to charter a boat for a short cruise so that you have some one who is experienced with the waters at the helm.          \nSomething else that wasn\'t mentioned are the large swells. I once took my lake style boat onto the ocean in Key West. My biggest problems were the swells. I was constantly speeding up and slowing down going over the swells. But if you have a ocean worthy boat they should be able to cut through these swells. Otherwise stay within sight of land and you shouldn\'t have a problem.          \nGood luck . If you go out you might want to get one of them things that call the coastguard when you get lost or the boat won\'t go home for you . They are nice to have . So if your fiance can\'t "tame the wild ocean waters" you turn it on and the coastguard will come and get you . And you don\'t have to tell him you have it . Better then a phone .          \nCaptain Ron sound like a some 1 that U can get U into trouble real quick. Best watch the weather.Tame the sea. Mother nature will show him some new tricks. Stay in shore and close to land beside the sunsets in the west and the mountains will block it.          \nto keep this a stress free honeymoon, suggest that you go out in chartered fishing boat. this will also give you a much better chance to catch fish. \r\n \r\nhere is a site that lists boat rentals and charters in Oregon \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nthere are lots of bay, rivers and lakes, in OR,  that you can boating on with out the problems that can occur in the ocean. \r\n \r\nhope this helps          \nNight and day,the sea is very more dangerous with a high chance you will die, you need training, and why don\'t you ask the coast guard, why don\'t they patrol lakes as-well as the sea.why do landlubbers treat the sea with no respect          \nBig difference! \r\nAnyone that thinks they can "tame the ocean" is in for some big trouble, and a very fast change of attitude.          \nThe vital factor that came in my thoughts when I saw this stand was \'rust\'. A bowrider probably can manage the sea if you choose your times but the salt-water will easily impact anything on the vessel that is not corrosion - evidence. Once suffering from corrosion it is very challenging if possible at all to recover. Same goes for the motor. What type of motor has the vessel, is it appropriate for sodium water?          ',
	 'question': u'\n    For our honeymoon, my fiance and I are going to Oregon. We thought it would be fun to rent a boat and go out on the water and fish & watch the sunset. We had a boat for a while, and would take it out on the very large lake near us every other weekend. My fiance is pretty confident he can "tame the wild ocean waters" as he put it - but neither of us have ever seen the ocean in person, let alone actually been on it.  \r\n \r\nSo since my fiance has prior boating experience, do you think he would be ok driving one on the ocean alone?  \r\n \r\nHow much different is driving on the ocean than a large lake?

	{'answer': u'\nI go to the dollar stores for cat food,kitchen utensils and spices. Same brand names and there\'s no big line to stand in.          \nSometimes and for certain things I do, I tend to not trust food items in these stores but they are great for things like toiletries and garbage bags, sandwich bags cleaning supplies etc. I shop second hand stores for clothing and kitchen things sometimes as well.          \nI do have a look see about once per fortnight, Lily. \r\nCharity shops will find me in their DVD shelves \r\nlooking for odd gems that I cannot find elsewhere. \r\n \r\nPoundshops can be handy too, I sometimes purchase \r\ndomestic cleaning products there, and the odd book \r\nor two, though as they only stock remainders in books \r\nI do not often find much that I would wish to read. \r\n \r\nThey also stock things like 28 packs of enteric coated Aspirin \r\nwhich are cheaper than the pharmacies. \r\nEven bought some dahlia tubers last year and they were a \r\nlovely bright show. I often find myself saying to people, \r\n"Oh, I got it at the Poundshop", no need to feel any \r\nembarrassment in this economic climate.!          \nOften, and more and more each month. \r\nI live in a town of 2,000 people and we have 2 of them. \r\nThere\'s some great deals to be had.          \nI buy most of my clothing from charity shops also other odds and ends and these shops are really cheap and the quality is good.          \nYes I do.  We now have 5 charity shops in our little town.  I recently got a set of pyrex casserole dishes (4 sizes plus the table stand) for 5 pounds. They have a lovely sunflower design on them and were still in the box.  It looked like they had been a wedding present that had just never been used.  I also got 3 Gucci ties for my son for 2 pounds each.   \r\n \r\nAlso, given the poor quality of some of the new clothes in the shops in the UK these days I would rather have a good quality 2nd hand  garment that a new one that goes out of shape after the first wash. \r\n \r\nI also buy more groceries and wine from stores like Lidl and Aldi than I used to.    \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nI visit them regularly. \r\n \r\nWe do a lot of entertaining and there\'s a continuous breakage of glassware, cos we serve up a glass of port or sherry often and the glasses get broken, so I\'m always popping in to one of the Thrift Stores, on the look-out for some nice looking cheap small wine glasses.  \r\n \r\nWhile I\'m there I always check out the used clothing section, on the look-out for waistcoats (my favourite collection...)          \nI check out the dollar store about once a month when I go to the used book store because they are in the same plaza.          \nYes i do my dear          \nYes, I buy many of my clothes, as well as books, and kitchen items from Goodwill stores, which sells used donated clothes, and other items.  I think more and moe people are doing so, because I have noticed that  their prices have gone up lately.  I see absolutely no reason why good used items should not be recycled and the proceeds used for a good cause.          \nAll the time....They are my favorite kind of stores.          \nI love faith based thrift stores.During my first layoff I found some great buys on golf equipment. \r\n \r\nNow on my second layoff I found a wonderful buy on a necktie for interview purposes.I also donate kitchen items that I don\'t use to these stores for resale.I like to help others as I have been helped during these tough economic times.          \n99 shops.          \nI like shopping local, & b/c all of the area dollar stores are chain stores, I rarely visit them.  And when I do, I look only at a few things--as most of the stuff in the dollar store is of junk quality.  I\'ll buy potpourri & scented oil, but not much more. \r\nThe thrift stores are a lot better.  They have a variety of stuff of much better quality--the junk stuff has long since broken. All my clothing is second-hand.  My shoes are all brand-new.          \nI do go to dollar stores sometimes but you have to be careful because they are not always the cheapest on many items or the quality is not as good.          \nI go to a Dollar Tree about once a month, sometimes more to buy certain items that are lower-priced than Wal-mart\'s similar items.  Our local thrift stores have been very busy during the past 3 years, used to practically have some of those stores to myself during week-day mornings (right after I retired) but now they are  buzzing with customers, so bargains are getting harder to find.          \nMy missus is very shrifty!, with "her "money?, say no more Tom, or you might get into trouble.......          \nNot so much the charity shops, but I often buy stuff from the pound shops.   \r\n \r\nThey sell gardening gloves, the kind with the palm grip, for \xa31 obviously, and they are great for my hubby\'s work.  If he bought them from the builder\'s merchants they would be 3 or 4 times that price, and they last just as long.          \nI go to dollar stores regularly, to pick up certain items, which are cheaper than big stores.  Lately, however, I have been trying to do research on their food items, just out of curiosity. \r\n \r\nOne thing about ground coffee, that I have found.   It\'s pretty good and only a dollar for a good sized bag.  Turns out the coffee is from Viet Nam.  Little did I know that Viet Nam is the second largest coffee exporter, next to Brazil.          \nI enjoy browsing in these sorts of shops, don\'t always buy something but it is fun to look around. \nIn Hungary, we go to the swap meet, or boot sale held every weekend in the city park. \nSome very interesting old things there, hats,old fur coats and boot leg DVD\'s. It is exciting when the police come in a sometimes raid the bootleggers, we watch from afar, cheap thrills. \nI have found a few nice items in one of the large second hand stores in Budapest, the prices over all on used clothing is much cheaper in the US at the Goodwill stores. \nI think the VAT is added into the prices overseas and it is getting harder to find good deals on used clothing there. \nI noticed for a new sweater at the H&M stores it was about $40. a used H&M sweater \nat the thrift store was $20. and used up looking, they are getting to greedy over in Hungary on their used items. \nWe have just stocked up on 99 cent items here in the US, small things that will travel well in my suitcase, reading glasses, aspirin bottles and such. \nI just gave the Goodwill store a huge bag of used clothing, it\'s nice to recycle things that no longer fit or are being used. \nMy husband is the one that saves allot of money on his second hand purchases. \nHe has been working on 2 cars for our son, he has picked up very new parts some slightly used and saved at least $1,000 or more just in the past month \nHe uses the internet for days sometimes and scouts out the best prices even for new car parts. \nSince he is now retired, he has more time then money where as in the past he had money and no time. \nHe is trying to teach our son how to save by doing for himself and making sure he does maintenance on everything he owns.He is the biggest bargin hunter I know. \nI was trying to get him to buy himself a few pairs of new jeans, he loves wearing Lee brand black jeans. He has several pairs, still in good shape only problem is black fades over time in the wash. \nHe had me buy a bottle of fabric dye, going to try it out on a couple of pairs before purchasing some new pairs,a little time and a couple of dollars could save us $100. or so on jeans. \nHope they come out looking new or at least newer.          \nYes, yes I do.          \nCertainly, I called in the poundstore yesterday to buy a large pack of white envelopes....\xa31 for 80          \nMore, now that I\'m retired.  The dollar stores for certain items, but you have to be on the lookout for quality.  Some things are just too cheaply made.  The area charity store is huge and I have found some very wonderful things in there at dirt cheap prices.  That is where I have brought home 2 stainless steel pans and decided I loved them so much, I had to buy a new cookware set.   I love them.          \nDefinitely, things are getting so expensive now you have to look around for cheaper prices. I always go into the pound shops, rather pay a pound for goods than what the supermarkets are charging for the same product.          \nAll the time,I\'m still mourning the loss of NETTO.          \nAh... We called them thrift stores.  It is odd that more & more of them are also cropping up here too. \r\nAlso the swap meets or flea markets have more & more people looking & buying.  Mankind has returned to the traditional ways of shopping.  I do not enjoy shopping but I find a wide variety of used books for fair prices.          \nNo, but I always look around before I spend money.  At my age I no longer need to buy clothes, shoes, and things for the house and yard.  Most of my shopping is over the internet.          \nYes - we go into the dollar stores now and then.          \nI visit them regularly.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I find during these austere times that I'm increasingly calling into the lower priced emporiums and in doing so I've saved quite a bit of money. \r\n \r\nThe charity shops are taking over our High Streets in the UK when sadly a chain store or local retailer has gone out of business, I  often find myself drawn in and browsing often picking up a book or a nice set of tumblers or a puzzle for the grandchildren. \r\n \r\nOur pound stores are better now in that they've widened the choices and have cut pack in those large multi packs which are of course wasteful. \r\n \r\nSo are you like me in that you like to hunt around for that bargain and save a little along the way?

	{'answer': u'\nBreathing          \nBEING the perfect mate.  \r\n.          \nBaking the perfect cookie of course!          \nComing to the realization that perfection doesnt exist and the best thing you can do is find someone who\'s BS you\'re willing to put up with, because they are willing to put up with your BS.  \r\n \r\nA little compromise goes a long way in a relationship.          \nFinding one that loves you despite all your imperfections.          \nBeing able to live with yourself.          \nwipe before you get up          \nRealizing that the "perfect mate" does not exist.  \r\nI suppose my hubby not being perfect makes him perfect for me.  \r\nDon\'t try to change people to fit your idea of perfect.          \nLooking good.  Just kidding.  I\'m not looking for perfect; just one that is alive. lol          \nLoving yourself. Everything starts there. \r\n \r\nFinding a perfect mate is nice, but becomes worthless if you don\'t love yourself. Your perfect mate wouldn\'t be worth much to you if you gave her any less than a person that loves themselves.          \nHaving the means to show him/her how much they mean to you.          \nRealizing that if you were to find a perfect mate, you would be the first one who ever did.          \nFinding someone you can talk to and trust with your secrets, someone who will be there for you, someone who you connect with one more than just one level. \r\n \r\nPlus you know... \r\n \r\nOther stuff.          \nFinding peace within yourself is more important. You should never depend on something outside of yourself for fulfillment.          \nEmbracing the "right" mate,despite the imperfections... \r\n \r\n((((Uncle Wizzayne))))..rockin\' da house fo reeal,G \r\n \r\n((((Radio Auntie Ape Rides Again))))...LOL!!!...love it,Wayne..          \nBeing happy with yourself for who you are.          \nNOT confusing the various ointments in my medicine cabinet. \r\n \r\nPeace.          \nA mate you can actually get along with          \nWould you consider the importance of the "perfect" book end instead..          \nliving cant have a mate if youre dead          \ni guess "the purrfect mate" \r\njust trying to score 10 per your avatar, unless youre actually choking the pussy          \nFinding your purpose in life and fulfilling it          \nMarkyyy said what I was thinking about. Having love and self respect means far more than anyone elses love or opinion \r\nThanks Uncle and everyone who answered - this is what I have been needing for the last few days. I finally remembered what I forgot  \r\nNot to say that I wont have battles with myself but yeah I remembered what means the most to me...MY inner peace \r\n((((Uncle)))) ((R&S))          \nIf we are serving God, he will find a mate for us, and this is our perfect gift from him, no matter how we see it. But I think more importantly, is finding that relationship with God so we can find our place in the world so things will run smoothly.... i dunno, just what came to mind when I saw the question.          \nFinding someone who can be there for you mentally, emotionally and physically and whom you want to do the same...

	 'question': u'\n    An extraordinarily handsome man decided he had the God-given responsibility to marry the perfect woman so they could produce children beyond comparison. \r\n \r\nWith that as his mission he began searching for the perfect woman. After a diligent, but fruitless, search up and down the east coast, he started to head west. Shortly thereafter he met a farmer who had three stunning, gorgeous daughters that positively took his breath away. So he explained his mission to the farmer, asking for permission to marry one of them. \r\n \r\nThe farmer simply replied, "They\'re all lookin\' to get married, so you came to the right place. Look them over and select the one you want." \r\n \r\nThe man dated the first daughter. The next day the farmer asked for the man\'s opinion. \r\n"Well" said the man, " She\'s just a weeeeee bit, not that you can hardly notice, but pigeon-toed." \r\n \r\nThe farmer nodded and suggested the man date one of the other girls; so the man went out with the second daughter. \r\n \r\nThe next day, the farmer again asked how things went. \r\n"Well," the man replied, "She\'s just a weeeee bit, not that you can hardly tell, cross-eyed." \r\n \r\nThe farmer nodded and suggested he date the third girl to see if things might be better. So he did. \r\n \r\nThe next morning the man rushed in exclaiming, "She\'s perfect, just perfect! She\'s the one I want to marry!" So they were wed right away. \r\n \r\nMonths later the baby was born. When the man visited nursery he was horrified: the baby was the ugliest, most pathetic human you can imagine. He rushed to his father-in-law asking how such a thing could happen considering the parents. \r\n \r\n"Well," explained the farmer, "She was just a weeeee bit, not that you could hardly tell, pregnant when you met her."

	{'answer': u'\nOld bastard is fine with me,that\'s what most folks call me.          \nNo, I take it as a Badge of Honor          \nIt always seems to me high school seniors took dibs on that label long ago.. \r\nIt seemed a wee bit uncomfortable 13 years ago, at 65. I don\'t use the term, unless asked. \r\nMy niece thinks it should be, "Mature citizen"          \nYou know when I was younger I use to call the older people  *old people*,old man or old lady,  but now that I am older in my late 50\'s I am not ready for that yet but if I have to choose it would be *younger senior citizens*, then when I reach your age you can call me a senior citizens..calling me an old lady etc is mean, to me anyway...:)=)          \nNo, it has never bothered me (73).  Everything has been good for my husband and me since we became seniors.          \nI don\'t like old bag.          \nNah, at 63, it\'s true, I am a senior citizen.  So much is untrue and held out as truth that I\'m tickled at truth.  I\'ve not quite gotten my head completely around it, so fast as life goes, in those perspective moments when things behind are so easy to recall.  Then, all I have to do is see another pretty woman in her twenties, her face in the news or one modeling in her slim body, to remember being there.  It\'s all good, all of it.          \nI happened to see Merlin\'s answer and I agree it\'s a badge of honor. What I hate is when somebody calls me "Momma"!  yuck yuck yuck, I am not your momma, nor would I own up to it if I were.          \nI don\'t mind but usually the word senior suffices.          \ni dont care what they call me as long as they call me in time for supper   :}          \nAt 55 it never has bothered me.          \nAs they say "call me what you want, but don\'t call me late for supper !". \r\nI will go along with anything as long as it isn\'t meant in disrespect.  Senior or sir is fine with me.          \nNot in the least!  Although,  I do want all the senior \'discounts\' that come with that title!  lol! \r\nI only have to look at my reflection to see the gray hair and wrinkles, take my teeth out or visit with my children or grandchildren to know I cannot escape my age anymore.  But, if I can avoid all those distractions, I can \'feel\' as young as I want!  lol! \r\n \r\nPeace and Blessings \r\n(((Warren)))          \nI am seventy years old and married to a woman nine years younger and we both prefer that nothing is said indicating our ages.Some of my close friends who are much younger call me a old buzzard but all in fun and these same people are always ready to except both me and my spouse as equals on equal terms.          \n. \r\nWhen I turned 50, I was definitely not comfortable with the label of Senior Citizen. I looked and acted a lot younger than 50, so I convinced myself that Senior Citizen wasn\'t an age at all, but a state of mind. \r\n \r\nI still believe that, even though I am way past 50. But I\'ll take the discounts anyway! \r\n.          \nNope.  I feel very fortunate to have made it this far.  Many of my friends, acquaintances, and classmates are already gone.  I\'m not that old, by the way...          \nI don\'t mind. I rather enjoy being offered a seat on the bus. Nice to see that good manners still exist. \r\nRose P.          \nI usually like to be called by my name and I am NOT a senior citizen, LOL.  Seriously, when someone calls me "Sir,"  I generally look over my shoulder to see who might be behind me. \r\n \r\nOh, I suppose someday I will have to resign myself to being an old man, but I don\'t relish the idea of being called a "dirty" old man, which considering my history, seems inevitable.          \nIt don\'t really bother me, but in this state they usually only consider you a senior if you are over 55. If my memory serves me right, you had a photo on here a long time ago and you weren\'t ugly. I could be mistaken, but I thought you had a photo on here..          \nI\'ve never personally been called a SC to my face & I don\'t refer to people as a SC either. People are people & they\'re either younger than me, my age, or older than me, plain & simple. When I was a youngster, I remember hearing my parents refer to people as an older man or an older woman. I grew up referring to them in the same way. How others refer to those much older than them, should do so with respect.          \nIt is better than being called "old fart" or \'"Geriatric".          \nNope love it, cause I earned it along with every gray hair and wrinkle.66 and lovin life          \nI can still remember the first time I was called a senior citizen. I resented it and chewed out the kid at Sizzler\'s. Now I don\'t mind being called a senior,but I prefer if someone asks first if I want the discount.          \nI am too tired to party, too smart to drink a lot, I have never done drugs and my wife says I have a date already. I ache too much to run get fat when I sit and eat smaller portions. So if I get a discount on something why not appreciate the fact that something is in my favor.          \nI think you are are a sweet young guy. That\'s how you come across, so it\'s who you are. IMHO          \n70 is the new fifty.          \nI am 55 and am quite comfortable with being considered a "senior citizen." The title I now hate is .."she\'s a widow at 55!" The word, widow is my pet peeve at this time.          \nWell as it would be incorrect,I wouldn\'t be too happy. Senior Citizen is a term used by governments and the public in general to folk who have retired or are drawing an age related  pension. When I was 50.I was addressed as I was at 40,forename,or surname,among others. \r\nI am now a senior citizen,but if someone wished to stop me and maybe ask a question,there are better ways than \'excuse me senior citizen,can you..\'          \nI don\'t mind being called a senior I just mind looking like it. I would rather be called by my name.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I\'m 69, a few months short of being 70, and it sort of bothered me at first, but now I don\'t mind. \r\n \r\nOne reason:  discounts.  My goodness, they sure have a lot of them for senior citizens, and if they gave a discount for being ugly I\'d make a face! \r\n \r\nSeriously, some people don\'t like being called senior citizens.  If you are over 50 and one of these, what would you rather be called?  I respond to "older," "elderly," even "geezer."  (Sometimes.)  You can call be "gramps," or "grandpa," though only if you are a child of one of my sons.  (And I better know about ALL of those!) \r\n \r\nWhat say you? \r\n \r\n(Ladies and gents both welcome to share here.)  ',

	{'answer': u'\nI don\'t know what you are talking about.          \napply for life insurance!! \r\napply for your handicap thing to park closer to the stores          \nAn AARP membership is definitely a good start.  Right now, you\'re still too young to apply for any Government programs.  As for social activities, wow, there are so many things you can get involved in!  Decide what interests you, then join.  Most Senior centers want you to be 60 or over.  There are many living communities for people 55 and over that have fantastic social calendars.  Your best bet is to look into what\'s available for seniors in your area.  Good luck, and have fun; you\'re life is really just starting!          \nOther than the AARP, I don\'t think u would qualify for anything else yet...You have to be atleast 62 I think... Your not old!!  Old is..... over 70!!!          \nwow, Happy pre Birthday. Your turning 55 years young is a blessing. A.A.R.P. would probably be a good thing to have, however you know in the U.S. you\'re not really considered a senior til you\'ve reached the age of 62 and even then there really aren\'t any benefits. I say enjoy life, take some time off and enjoy you. Go to Disney world with some of your friends or go on a cruise. You don\'t always need a boyfriend, sometimes a relationship can cause unecessary stress.          \nHAHA now you get to go to the movies for a senior rate, get your Dunkin Donuts at the senior rate, ride the bus at a senior rate. Take advantage of it all granny          \nYou are still a youngster!!!!  True you are no longer "middle aged" (who lives to 110?) but you are not over the hill. \r\nYes get an AARP card- You can get some pretty good discounts with it for any kind of insurance (car, life, etc), hotel/motel discounts, travel discounts, extra services at your bank, and restaurants. \r\nJust because you are 55 doesn\'t mean you have to live a senior lifestyle. You sound young so stay young. Use senior discounts when it is convenient or profitable to you. \r\nAs far as anything else, I think that is really all until you hit your early 60s then their is medicare, SSI, etc. \r\nBy the way, if you look as young as you sound don\'t be surprised if they ask for ID when you ask for a senior discount! \r\nEnjoy your birthday!          \nWhat is the most paramount of your needs, I think that should be a companion or relationship. I strongly advise you to look for a guy that you can love and trust for a friendship. Life is too wide to live it all alone. Think about this. You may contact me on my profile for further discussion(s). Good luck.          \nFirst of all stop referring to yourself as a "Senior" Get a life.  Your only as young as you feel, age is just a number.  You have so much to look forward to.  Start thinking positive.  If you change the way you think, things start to change.  Take some time out for yourself.  It\'s time you start pampering yourself.  You deserve it.  Look how you have made so many people happy by styling their hair.  Get a make over, and go on a cruise, I\'m sure you will meet someone to fulfill your dreams.  Good Luck!          \nyour as old as you feel, but you need to call AARP and ask them why they didn\'t send you an enrollment form.. But it isen\'t free to join, you have to pay for the membership.. \r\n1year is 12.50 2years is 21.00 and 3 years is 29.50.. \r\n \r\nYeap, nothing in life is free.. \r\nBut you will get discounts and when you join, you will get news letters that will tell you where the discounts are.. Your really not a senior dear..  \r\n \r\nIt doesn\'t matter if your black, purple, white or red.. But since being black is so important, I would call the NAACP and ask them what your entitiled to.. \r\n \r\nGood luck..          \ni do not understand u          \nwell, i\'m not sure what you need to do, but let me tell you what my husband and i have done.   i am 29 years old and he is 31 years old.  we have a 3 and a 5 year old.  we have life insurance.we researched until we found the right one for us.  our insurance is on all four of us.  it also includes hospital payments (different amounts for different things)  if one of our children has to go to the ER for a broken arm  we fill out a claim and receive $300.  if we are admitted to the hospital we receive $500 for 7 days ...ect..ect... \r\n  we also went and arranged all of our funeral arrangements so when the time comes all we have to do is turn it into the insurance company.  we also made up our wills, bought our cemetery plots, we made each other legal power of attorneys over our medical decisions if we can\'t make them, we even talked about  wether or not we want to be saved or DNR . \r\nwe have 401k plans in progress along with a savings and 2 bank CD\'s for our children\'s college education \r\n \r\ni know this might sound morbide, but we just don\'t want our children to have to worry about planning anything, or having to pay the bill.  i saw how hard it was on my mom a couple of years ago when my grandma died.  and also we needed to make the will so that if anything does happen to us we know that are children will be well taken care of.          \nim 54 and i think ive just lost my lady for good ---- i dont want any benefits they limit you so i have no idea what is available --- and it will vary country to country ---- do a google search and check the governement website that should be a good start          ',

	{'answer': u'\nI don\'t know about boats, but this Norwegan ice breaker in Minnesota has no equal.  \n \n           \nHe is talking about the Vasa which sank in Stockholm harbour 20 minutes into its first voyage. The shipbuilder knew very well how to build good ships. If he had been left alone, Vasa would have been a good ship. Unfortunately, the admiral interfered constantly, adding things (for instance, extra cannon) that made the ship top-heavy. After the sinking, the King and government tried to make the ship builder responsible, but he produced all these signed notes from the admiral, so it was the admiral who got into trouble. \n \nA Swedish researcher found the wreck in the 1950s, and she was raised in 1961. They have now built a wonderful museum around her in Stockholm \nEnglish language  \nSvenska  \n \nEvery nation has a story like this. If your "friend" is American, ask what Captain Bainbridge did with USS Philadelphia (ran her aground, surrendered and was captured by Arab pirates, held prisoner for 19 months). If your friend is English, ask about the Mary Rose (almost the same as the Vasa).          \nHere is a link to the VASA Museum.  \n \n \nIf your friend can read have him look up what the Swedish have now as far as cutting edge ships and gunboats. Not to mention land based armor like tanks and planes.          \nHe\'s talking about the Vasa... believe it sank before the king\'s very eyes. Regardless of what your buddy says, Sweden kicks out some top notch tradesmen/women. \nThe only reason people want to hire me (an American) is because I apprenticed under a Swede that learned to build boats in his homeland. Apprenticing under him for four years was one of the hardest things I\'ve ever done, but it\'s paid off tenfold.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nI didn't like school and don't miss it. Reading and writing make it a little more understanding as to it coming to the lessons of life. The schools today have to much power. They are their own entity and screw your thoughts.          \neducation is a tool you use it to uncover the truths of life          \nIt's taken 41 years to try to undo the brainwashing.          \nEducation is the key to success, it does not guarantee success, but it opens doors that will remained closed with out the qualifying degree.          \nLearning is good, education is good, schools do the best they can with what they have available.  Unfortunately, schools are somewhat similar to the one-size-fits-all hat.  Just right for a very small number of people, usable for a good portion of people, totally unusable for the rest.  The most important thing to keep in mind when trying to get an education is that only you can make it worth while.  I went to a public school with very overcrowded classrooms.  I went to local colleges.  I think I got an outstanding education!  It's what you make of it.          \nIf there is one thing that schools prepare you for that is very necessary in life, it is the ability to LEARN. You do not get anywhere in this life if you can not learn from it. As to what you learn in schools, let us say that it provides a very good base for what you need to learn from life--Maths for instance. Do you think you could go a day without needing some simple maths skills?  \r\n \r\nSchool also teaches us how to look below the surface of things and figure out what it really is that we are seeing....and that is a skill all of us need to get by in this world.  \r\n \r\nAnd who doesn't benefit from the ability to sound like an educated person? We are much more socially acceptable if we sound like we have some brains in our heads. \r\n \r\nSo I guess my answer to you is that they are equally important. School teaches us how to learn the things we need to learn from life. And gives us the tools to interpret what we learn in a logical manner.          \nI never liked it...I went because I had to.  As far as I'm concerned, past elementary school where I learned to reading, writing, basic math skills, how to deal with and accept authority figures who weren't my parents...I never learned anything I couldn't have learned by just living my life.  Which I why I never went to college...and I've made a decent living for myself in spite of that.  Admittedly though...higher education is a necessary evil nowadays...a every expensive one, I might add.          \nthe schools and education are not too bad but need some upgrading about things in life that are very important, like how does stock market work and investing, buying a house, getting loans for cars and homes, buying cars and such. all this stuff I learned on my own and would have been better to teach the young today about this stuff, so many people are ready to rip the young off when it comes to these things and if they were better educated this wouldn't happen. the problem is the parents, they do not raise their kids, just let them raise themselves and with both working don't want to be bothered, send of to bedroom or leave home along and this is when bad things happen, this did not happen in the olden days, sure there were a few bad apples but not like today \r\n  today education is very important ,when we were young there were so many factories that paid well and had lots of jobs , not like today where there is hardly none, so an education back than was not as important as today's is.          \nI have had college education but didn't actually pull the strings together until I was hands on the job doing what we were taught about in school.   \r\nThink allot of this education business has become just that a business with little regard to what the student will actually need when they get on the job.

	{'answer': u'\nNo. and never have.          \nI like to shop around to find the best bargains          \nOne roof. The local market. But only because I now live too far from the city to want to regularly spend an entire day of driving and the better part of a tank of gas just to get some nice quality foods.          \nnope          \nwe buy all of our meat by the side , i also harvest several deer each year , buy basic canned goods ( corn beans peas etc ) by the case. we give at least 20 to 30% of what we buy to the local food bank          \nGood morning Lily, (it\'s almost 6am here) \r\nMuch like you we buy must things at one place (walmart). We grow most of our summer vegetables and trade some at a farmer\'s market.I also buy free range eggs from a farm down the road.          \nIn these tough economic times stores have to earn my loyalty and two in the Metro Atlanta area have managed to do so.I do the bulk of my shopping at Kroger\'s for their excellent generics and Trader Joe\'s when I wish to reward myself with a treat. \r\n \r\nHowever for the cat\'s food and litter I go with Pet Smart.          \nHave a choice between 7 super markets, so we go for the best at each....          \nI do most grocery shopping in 1 store, but when needing any paperwares I do that at another store, only once in awhile we will go to a butcher, and that probably 3-4 times a year..it\'s just to bad when you can\'t shop under one roof and get everything you need at a bargain price though..it would save on gas prices!!..=)          \nno and have never shopped at one store. you have to shop at least 2 stores to get deals you need, for those who shop at only one will never get deals they could use, but some prefer to do that because they don\'t want to be bothered with all the travel, but most all i know do more than one.          \nI shop in different places.          \nNo.  \r\nBefore I learnt  to drive, my (now) ex and I would go shopping on Saturday morning. Strictly a two stop affair. One supermarket for food  and the other for booze and tobacco. \r\nAs soon as I got my driving licence, my husband said he preferred meat from the butchers, bread from the bakery, cheese from the cheese shop, vegetables from the market. Bless him!          \nAll under one roof at Morrisons.  I have very little time because I work full-time x          \nBetween the super market and street market          \ninside shopping now there\'s a novelty out here? nope everything bought in marketplace, besides lots of haggling goes on and one can enjoy a Macadamia tea whilst one is being dragged around by Xia. \r\nFor some items well one admits they get flown in as the local stalls just don\'t have what one needs.          \nI don\'t really \'do shopping\' but on the occasions I go down town with the gaffer I would prefer to walk around,she shops mainly at Morrisons,personally I would buy everything from independent shops or the open market. Maybe that\'s why she hates me tagging along. \r\nBury,which is our next town seems popular,folk can park their car and go into the shopping centre and an open market attached,the town is just a glorified shopping centre now and I can\'t stand the place.          \nWith 4 stores in town we watch the specials & shop around. There are 2 Aldi stores near us too & get things there when close to one.          \nSince I can walk across the parking lot to a huge super market, this is where I shop.  We do have a Grocery Outlet store in town and I go there several times a year.  On a good day, I can find Sara Lee sour dough bread which is now priced at over $4.00 a loaf at most stores,  for 99 cents at this store.  They also carry brand shampoos, lotions, etc. at this discount store.          \nI got to one supermarket because they have a great selection and have everything  I need.  I simply don\'t have the time or desire to go to multiple stores.  I do agree with you though that a local butcher shop would have better cuts of meat however I don\'t have one in my neighbourhood and am not driving out of my way for it.          \nI get fruit from our near-enough-by local farmers. On that rare occasion that I want to cook fresh vegetables, I get them there too. Paper products, cleaning and grooming supplies from our Dollar Store. Deli and bakery from the grocer. Certain brands only, of frozen vegetables, and rarely a meat.          \nLily, I haven\'t seen a butcher shop in YEARS>.......many years!!! \r\n \r\nI do most of my shopping at our Super Wal Mart! \r\n \r\ni also go to Giant and Blooms..."Blooms is expensive, but I like the quirky things I can find there" \r\nI don\'t go to Bloom\'s very often!          \n2 roofs...          \nAt the moment i am buying most of my things at one place. This move has disrupted my shopping habits and places where I would usually go to shop.          \nI\'m 52, and detest doing the food shopping.  Yes, I do it all under 1 roof.  Can\'t be bothered to faff about.          \nI live in  a rural area.  So,  I plan menus and make one hour long drive a month to major shopping.  I have a planned route.  I use three stores but I don\'t have to visit every one every month.  I make a list and stick to it.          \nMore or less I do, I go to Morrison\'s a big store near me, or Asda also quite near me and Lidl email\'s with their bargains.          \nOh for the days when there were butcher shops. I\'m trying to remember the last butcher shop in our area. I don\'t know where you live,but I\'d like to move there just to see another butcher shop. They have the meat section in the supermarket but the quality is lacking.          \nlI usually get most of it in the \'discount \'  grocery store,   that I\'m trying to keep in business now that Walmart has loomed.    But there are a very few things, they don\'t carry that I get in Walmart, or in the upscale grocery store in town.          \nNo.   Some of the stores have things I just can\'t live without that the others don\'t.  Then there are the speciality stores like Brennan\'s, featuring the best in vegatables, fruits, cheeses and spirits and imported goodies.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    or do you perhaps do your main shop in the supermarket and then like me go along to the butchers, grocers, farm shop etc? \r\n \r\nWhen I was younger mainly for time and convenience I used to do all my weekly shop in the one main store but now as I have a little more time on my hands I like to go along to a local butcher and select my cuts of meat which are generally far better quality and a little cheaper especially if I buy more than just one item. \r\n \r\nI'm also very lucky in that I have an excellent farm shop close by which sells all my grocery needs plus good quality dairy products and free range happy chickens and eggs again at a reasonable price. \r\n \r\nDo you have the time and opportunity to spread your shopping around or are you content to do it all under one roof ?

	{'answer': u"\nPeople in their 60s had the highest injury rate for push mowers, while those 70 and older had the highest injury rate for riding mowers. \r\n \r\nHowever, kids younger than 15 also had a \u201csubstantial\u201d injury rate, Costilla and Bishai write. \r\n \r\nAND PEOPLE WITH PUSH MOWERS/RIDING MOWERS SHOULD BE CAREFUL. \r\nTHAT AGE GROUP WOULD ACCOUNT FOR HALF I WOULD IMAGINE FOR ALL USING LAWNMOWERS. \r\n \r\nWOULD EXPECT A LARGE % OF INJURY.          \nHeck, I hope not. I was just thinking about buying a huge petrol-powered self-propelling brushcutter to keep the weeds down around the trees we're about to plant on a couple of acres.I'm 65 next month. \r\nIt's as well to remember that our reactions may be slower, and not take silly risks, but I'm not quite ready to give in yet.          \nMy dad refuses to stop mowing the grass and just turned 87 yesterday. He uses a push mower. My brother comes over to dad's and they share the mowing, dad doing the small front lawn, and my brother the larger area in the backyard. He isn't ready to give up his independence. There are times when he will cut it before my brother gets a chance to help him, but most times, they cut it together. When the heat gets to be too much, my brother does it all for him, but to dad, it is important to him to still remain active. Perhaps he is an exception to the rule at his age, but by staying active, it helps him to remain physically and mentally healthy. I think as long as a person is in decent health, and strong enough to do so, there is no reason to not, along with having safety in mind.          \nYou know that can be true..my Uncle was using the riding mower once and for the last time..he had a heart attack while mowing and fell off the mower and the mower ran over his arm and he died..there was no one around so it was too late..I think if they have someone around while mowing, it would be okay..but if the person would mow when it not so darn hot they would be okay..unfortunately it was toooo hot for my Uncle..=(          \nNot unless they feel they should stop. \r\nI'm 62,not careless, reckless, nor do I beat up my tools or get angry with machinery. \r\nI had to laugh at riding mowers; some of our husbands get carried away beefing up power.          \nThe elderly know when they can no longer mow the yard. If they have family they should be doing it for them anyway.          \nOh no ,not unless they are senile or crippled with athritis . Seniors probably have the most injuries as they are probably the highest amount of people to cut the grass. Do you see many young working people cut the grass many let it get so long they probably cut the grass once to a senior doing it 3 times in the same period. great excercise  just be careful.          \nI'm 55 and always push mow my lawn. I just take breaks whenever i feel too hot.          \nIMHO  statistics are always screwy!   Probably most lawn mowers are over a certain age?  Or something.   Forget the statistics.   Do it if you like it,   or don't if you don't.  You know you'll be careful.          \nMy Grandfather did his lawn until the summer before he passed. He was 94. I'm almost 63 and I still do it.          \nI drive a riding lawnmower but have stopped pushing the other lawnmower because of my back. A man comes over to help me each week cutting the grass. Poppy          \nNot necessarily all senior citizens should give up lawn mowing... I am over 60 years old and I am not incompetent nor dead yet... My health is good and I do not have any prescription medicines to take because I learned a long time ago to use common sense whenever I do things. \r\n \r\nMake sure you drink plenty of water at all times; especially before you mow your lawn during warmer weather. Do your lawn care during the cooler hours of your day... Don't be too proud to take breaks during your lawn care work... Pace your work carefully and take advantage of the good exercise that you get while doing your lawn care...          \ncall your local church they can get you in touch with some young chaps that may do the job much cheaper than the lawn service and yes i believe that if it is to much for you physically don't take the chance my grandfather had a stroke while mowing          \nWell, I love mowing my yard (3 acres) with my riding mower.  I gave up everything else, I just won't give up my mower.  Sorry.          \nyes, buy a goat, saves all the hassle.          \nI mow three acres and trim around the house.  I'm the only one that can do it and I'm going to be 75 this summer.  Somebody has to do it.  I can't afford to pay to have it cut cause Obama is taking all my pension and S.S. check away from me.          \nI would like nothing more but because of lack of extra money I must keep mowing my own lawn.  So far, knocking on wood, at well over 60 plus I have avoided injury accidents with push mowers.          \nThat is one nice thing about winter, my lawn is under a foot of snow          \nWe use to have a mower that pulled itself.  Very nice.  When we got close to 70 it got to be too much so we hired someone to do it for us.          \nI think it all depends on the condition of the mower and the condition of the mower!  The actual equipment needs to be easy enough to  use so that it doesn't cause a lot of stress on the person mowing.  The person mowing should be in good physical condition.  My mother in law is 81 and mows with her new riding mower and trims with a push mower.  She is in good physical shape and does a good job.  She also splits wood.  We can't be there all the time for her, and she refuses to live by us anywhere so not much we can do to help.  Ornery little woman!          \nI will never give up my lawn mowing! I enjoy working in my yard and my lawn mower is like my gun, you cannot take it without a fight.          \nwhy          \nI know many people 85 + still mowing their lawn. I mow several lawns. I suppose that would depend on the person, but if someone can't handle the lawn mower, then they shouldn't be driving a car.  \r\nGo for it Daisymae, You feel like you can do it.          \nI'm lucky because my son owns his own lawn care service and 2 of his guys keeps my lawn mowed, fertilized, leaves raked, etc.          \nEveryone should give up lawn mowing. God makes grass grow to the correct height, then it stops.  All mowing does is waste gas and pollute the air.   \r\n \r\nAny study from Senior dot COM is likely to be a bogus report designed to fool some guy's wife.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    "Lawnmower injuries increase with age, with peaks in persons older than 59 years."

From Senior.Com \r\n \r\nJust when I thought of buying a new mower this spring and fire the lawn service to save money.  ',

	{'answer': u'\nReproductive success is grandchildren. Also, they can enjoy them, usually, without raising them.          \nthey don\'t. they may just be more relaxed.          \nNot really loving more.  They just get excited now they get to have the fun and not worry about the hard work involved in parenting.    I am an aunt and have witnessed my sister with my parents and her children.   \r\n \r\nBoth my parents wished she would have children JUST LIKE HER.    LOL.    She got them!          \nBecause they can hand them back and observe their own children making mistakes and having their kids complain about them.  Well all did it.          \nI think maybe they realized with age what\'s important. They want to be remembered as better people. Maybe they weren\'t great parents so it\'s their way of making up for it. Plus they don\'t have to deal with the everyday stress of raising the children so they are more relaxed. Which may appear as them liking the grand kids better.          \nThe overriding factor behind this act is that they want to compensate for their deficiency as they failed to provide enough love and care to their sons and daughters. \r\nOther factors include the extra time they have now to play with grandchildren. At this age they can better evaluate God\'s design and muse over a lot of things with grandchildren in their lap.          \nIts a common saying that when a person become old...He start behaving like a kid.So when they got grandchild at home...they like to enjoy with them.....tension free & full of fun.          \nBecause they share a common enemy... \r\nTheir kids/the grandchildren\'s parents.          \nit is as simple as setting sun is trying to see the glory of the rising sun          \nage 6 and 60 are same ,when grand fathers get their like minded to share their life they much more attracted towards them, not only that their own children cannot have that childish character because their serious involvement in life .it is their struggle why this grand fathers and children\'s seem to be happy  also. \r\nthe sad thing is that, we are all developing very unfavourable character IE to take parents to old age home.remember India is the only country where "social security"  are privatised by the very nature bharatheeya dharma. to keep parents with them and make them happy.          \nthat\'s neutral...

	{'answer': u"\nthe whole country is over taxed but I feel when it's time to retire you should not be paying taxes on your social security as it is now and any private pensions should not be either. property taxes should be a low based one. \r\n as far as sales tax or state I do believe they should pay their share as others do but nothing on any retirement pay, they have worked all their lives and deserve at least something for working and living that long. \r\n what is taxed now will surely be taxed when the young get theirs and even more.          \nNo I am not over taxed.  Neither are the majority of Americans.  We are actually paying fewer taxes now than we have ever.  The federal government has not imposed any new taxes on individuals for years.  Taxes have gone up at the state and local levels.  This is often a talking point with politicians.  They are hoping you are not inform and are attempting to appeal to you on an emotional level.   \r\n \r\nYou also wrapped all seniors up in your scenario.  There are plenty older and retired people that are doing just fine.  So, yes you are wrong.  You made a rash generalization.  You don't need to search far or hard to find seniors living in condos and enjoying life.  Just be more realistic about the issue.          \nOver taxed and our health care cost just as much on medicare with supplemental as it did before we went on medicare. Our school tax increases while they build bigger schools, higher wages and benefits to teachers and bring students into the area that don't even speak english and  whose parents do not contribute but take housing, food stamps and welfare. Now our area is building a multimillion dollar library while the kids are using e books. it will be just another place for those who want to commit more scams on the computers at the library.          \nThe US gov has existed longer w/o an income tax than it has w/. This (the income tax) is an element for it to spend out of control. \nGWB signed every spending bill to cross his desk. When he left office the national debt increased by around 9 trillion. I have no idea how most of that spending improved our lives but I can certainly see how the new record debt we set every day harms us. \nGov needs to make ends meet w/ the money we contribute as it demonstrates how easy it is to borrow. We're paying more in interest than most countries GNP. \nGov has abused the budget, it has stolen f/ the SS fund and it shows us how easy it is to spend someone elses money. \nMost of us are overtaxed but many of the largest corporations don't pay any.          \nI don't agree with you about the property taxes. You could have paid off your house and still be alive for another 20 - 30 years and to not have to pay taxes isn't fair, because you are still enjoying the services your community has to offer, including libraries and parks, and you grandchildren are going to the schools. BTW, I am a senior who lives exclusively on Social Security payments. I pay rent but a part of my rent goes to paying these taxes, too, through my landlord. That is as it should be.          \nYes and it's all pathetic too..=)          \nI am bothered more by how my tax dollar is spent.          \nProperty taxes are generally used to support continuing local public services such as police, fire, paramedic, schools, Many jurisdictions already give seniors a tax break for schools, since they don't use these anymore. But the rest you have to actually pay for, just like me and everyone else. The fact that you did not save enough money for your old age is not and should not be a taxpayer problem, so stop whining and get over it.          \nI agree with you 100%.          \nOh yeah! Same taxes everyone pays, and they are all outrageous!          \nFine, but hope you don't ever have to call the police or fire department, or use a library or take your dog for a walk in the park. I don't see why you should get a break from property taxes just because you're a senior. Maybe they could be lowered, but as long as you're living in your house, taxes should be paid to help pay for the services you use on a daily basis.          ",

Not forgetting the obligatory vast bottle of Hirondelle paint stripper. \n \nI shall dress in my best bib and ticker on the occasion of your celebrations, because I haven\'t got a best bib and tucker.          \nCongratulations and well done may there be many more ! \r\nI\'ll bring some Tasmanian scallop pies and pavlova with passionfruit,strawberries and whipped cream, \r\nI\'d LOVE some New Castle Brown Ale please,the best !          \nHead me in the direction of your alcoholic punch, please.   I\'ll bring some chicken breasts stuffed with haggis - mmmmm yummy.   I\'ll also bring some Scottish shortbread.          \nI am so ashamed Lily. I reached that mile stone and didn\'t throw a party. I was really expecting Yahoo to have a party for me. \r\n \r\nAlong with some humble pie, I\'ll bring the makins of some Reuben sandwiches.          \nHomemade mac n cheese. And some veggies and dip.   No calories special, just for pot lucks. :)   Pop is fine.  Maybe if I\'m going to eat a lot of rich stuff I better drink milk  or I\'ll be waking up later. \r\nCongratulations!          \nsome home grown collards with hamhock,crackling cornbread, homemade pickled peppers, and a senator russel sweet potato pudding.          \nCongratulations on reaching Level 7, and thank you so much for your kind invitation. \r\n \r\nI will be delighted to bring a very large silver serving tray of Assorted Cheeses and Fresh Fruit, in addition to a dessert tray of my famous Almond Macaroons. \r\n \r\nIced tea would be lovely, thank you!   \r\n \r\nIt\'s always a pleasure to be in your midst, Lily.          \nWell done Lily. \r\n \r\nMatthew was getting there when his account got zapped.

	{'answer': u'\nThe democrats are counting on it.            \nmy thoughts exactly, you get an star!          \nYes it bothers me.  \r\nA photo ID as well as a SS card should be shown for anyone voting anywhere. And no drivers licenses for illegals. With a drivers license they can register to vote. \r\nVoting is a right reserved for the citizens of this country only.          \nAbsolutely!          \nYes it does bother me because it is saying that the federal, state, county, and local governments are breaking the law by letting illegal immigrants vote. \r\n \r\nVoting is a right only for U.S. Citizens only and that is by law.  There is no \u201cspin\u2019 on this one.  If any lawyer or government official tells you otherwise then that person is lying and does not care about this country. \r\n \r\nAgain, illegal immigrants have no rights in this country until they get on line and request permission to enter this country legally. \r\n \r\nLet us do this to Mexico, Russia, or any other country as their illegal immigrants did to our country.  They would not like it also. \r\n          \nthe day they get the vote I will no longer go to the poles since it will no longer matter what the Americans want, of course they will vote for the one who can help them stay here, and give more hand outs,our country is in bad shape and can not support our own people          \nour govt knows this. that\'s why they make promises to illegals they know we united states citizens will fight to stop. i don\'t know what they can do. maybe they should start requesting id\'s and birth records when voting. it will upset U.S citizens. but we must do what we need to do to stop illegals. we need to make it harder on them so they will leave. they can take their anchor baby\'s with. company\'s who hire them should lose everything they have for hiring illegals.          \nIt bothers me a great deal. The fact that they are still here bothers me. The fact that our southern and northern borders still remain unsecured bothers me. This is a huge mess and needs to be cleaned up! Here again is just another instance where our government has failed "we the people". Absentee voting should only be allowed for people who are in the military or those that are American Citizens who are overseas for work, but you should have to prove it. There should be no same day registering and voting. These things need to be checked. I don\'t trust letting them vote and hoping that it will be caught later. That is nonsense. Trust the government to do anything right? Yeah, Right!          \nabsolutely.  I\'m an independent, neither democrat or republican but I would like democrats to explain to me why they are voting for Obama when his tax plan will clearly hurt small business and favor corporations overseas.  I\'d also like to know what democrats propose to do about illegal immigrants when our dollar is devalued as a result of this bail out bill and people in the U.S. struggle further for jobs.  Who do you think will be competing on the ground down here for work?            \nAs far as I know, only citizens can vote \r\n \r\nI have the feeling that those figures are totally wrong          \nIt concerns me that  David Simcox "A REPUBLICAN" would write such a thing! Is it that they are getting ready to lose the elections, and will want a recount because HE believes the illegals (whom are not eligible to vote) caused this sway? Hmmmmmm!          \nno          \nKitty Pilgrim: No photo ID is required. New Ohio voters have only to write down the last four digits of their Social Security number or write down their driver\'s license number. They can also register with the utility bill, cell phone bill, bank statement or paycheck, even college ID if those documents include name and address. Ohio Secretary of State, Democrat Jennifer Brunner, changed the rules on absentee voting by directive.  \r\nOhio State Rep. Larry Wolpert (R): There wasn\'t anything voted on. The General Assembly did not vote on this. The people\'s representatives did not vote on this. She issued a directive and said this is the way it\'s going to be. That\'s the reason why we had to sue in court.  \r\nPilgrim: The Republicans lost their suit against the rule in the Ohio Supreme Court. They charge the Democratic secretary of state changed the rules to usher in scores of new voters for presidential candidate Barack Obama. She denies the charge. The secretary of state\'s office estimates that a quarter of all votes cast in this election, more than a million and a half, will be absentee ballots.  \r\nPilgrim: Now Secretary of State Brunner\'s office today said there are safeguards for checking the registration of new voters. They\'re satisfied with the proof of identity requirements, but critics say election boards are unprepared to register and check this quantity of new voters just before an important election, Lou.  \r\nLou Dobbs: Has everybody lost their minds? There\'s no way for these volunteers to check that. I mean it\'s an absurdity. \r\n \r\nYeah just like they do in Ohio          \nYes. We can blame groups like democraps, liberals, communists, socialists, acorn, aztec, mexica movement, and la raza for these crimes. There are many more groups but the part I don\'t get is how we are letting them get away with it again.  If we stop these socialistic groups we may be able to get a handle on this issue. The sooner we get back to being 100% powered by capitalism the better off we will be. You earn your bread by the sweat of your brow and these poor illegals are being bribed with social programs, government stipends, and citizenship. You really have to watch the liberal Dem\'s and all of their agendas. Sad so sad.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    the thought that illegals will try to vote in this election? \r\nWhat do you think should be done at the polls to make sure all voters are legal? \r\nWhat should be done besides deportation to the ones found out trying to illegally vote? \r\n \r\nReport: Illegal Aliens Could Sway November Election  \r\n \r\nSays thousnds of illegals will vote in Texas  \r\n \r\nBy Jim Forsyth  \r\nThursday, October 2, 2008  \r\n \r\nA new report obtained by 1200 WOAI news indicates that illegal immigrants could vote by the hundreds of thousands in Texas and across the country, potentially swaying the election.  \r\n \r\n"Citizens of the United States would like to see their votes not diluted by those who are in this country illegally," said David Simcox, who studies voter rolls in 11 Texas counties.  \r\n \r\nSimcox says there are indications that as many as 329,000 non citizens and ineligible voters are on the rolls in Texas.  \r\n \r\nHe says Harris County is the worst, with some 200,000 ineligible voters.  \r\n \r\n"We ought to sit down and decide..do we want it to stay that way...do we want to sit down and blink at violations of voter registration laws," Simcox said.  \r\n \r\nBut Bexar County Elections Administrator Jackie Callanan disputed Simcox\'s figures. She says the state has a new database where all voters are cross checked.  \r\n \r\n"Using their drivers license or the last four digits of their Social Security Number," she said. "Our system is exceptional."  \r\n \r\nSimcox says the problem of illegal voters is not confined to Texas.  \r\n \r\nHe says there are up to 235,000 illegal voters in New York, up to 113,000 in New Jersey, 209,000 in Illinois, and as many as 700,000 illegal non citizen voters in California.  \r\n \r\nHe estimates that at least 1,830,000 non citizens voted in off year elections in 2006.  \r\n \r\nSimcox says he consulter several sources in compiling his figures, and he says the real problem is that the votes of citizens are being diluted when non citizens vote.  \r\n \r\n_________________ \r\n  ',

	{'answer': u'\nI did many years ago. Never got sued but enjoyed working for the elderly. If you go to church or are a member of an organization, you can usually find them that need help that\'s how I found them.          \nYes I did it for many years, and I had the same concern that  you have, I never had any problems and I wasn\'t insured, \r\n You can set your own limits, One lady wanted me to wash and dry her drapes I told her it was best if she sent them out to the cleaners I was so afraid I would ruin them          \nAs an elderly person I am very leary of someone who offers to do what you are offering. I wonder what monetary gain you would be getting out of it or if you planned to steal anything. I think you might be better off offering to clean out a garage in exchange for the junk you clean out; then sell it at a flea market.          \nI agree with" Life in the slow lane". I wouldn\'t let anyone in my house to do cleaning or anything like that without a background check and them having insurance or be bonded. Its unfortunate that things are the way they are now but elderly people get taken too often. You could look on the net for volunteer opportunities in your area. You could volunteer at a senior center. You could volunteer at a nursing home to visit, read, play cards, call bingo games etc. That is something that is very needed, there are a lot of lonely people in nursing homes. I would stay out of peoples homes unless you go to work for an agency.          \nWhat a lovely person you are!  What a kind thing to want to do.  Personally, I would contact a local hospice (that have people go into the homes)  and offer your services through them!    The Hospice crowd are always screaming for volunteers - so I am sure that you will be welcomed with open arms.   I know I am on Hospice, and many wonderful people help me out!    \r\n \r\nG-d bless you and have a truly Wonderful New Year! \r\n \r\nHave a star!               CJ          \nI haven\'t cleaned houses, but I have a service who has helpers who \r\ndo that for a living. There are home health care providers who work  \r\nwith state agencies like social services, who send out case workers \r\nto qualify seniors for in home care, or house cleaning, errand running \r\nand in general anything that can be helped with. I couldn\'t be without \r\nmy helper. And if she can\'t come on a particular day, they provide \r\na substitute. Today I had a woman sub, come and take down our \r\nlittle Christmas tree and pack everything away. She finished the \r\ndishes I had begun. She cleaned the bathroom, helped with the \r\nlaundry and helped move some clothes to my closet that were too \r\nheavy to carry without making many trips. These helpers can also \r\ncook meals, that can be reheated at the meal time their clients \r\nprefer. And they can assist if needed with bathing, dressing and \r\neven applying moisturing lotion on senior legs and feet. That is a \r\nheavenly experience.  There are many agencies that hire people \r\nto do these in home tasks. Many now require that their workers \r\ntake classes at the nearby college on first aid and helping seniors \r\nwith activities. This was an issue the public voted to approve in a \r\nrecent voting issue. Many states are requiring this as necessary \r\nto work in this capacity. I would suggest calling some of these \r\ncompanies and find out what their requirements are. And then \r\napply if you feel this is a work experience you\'d enjoy. I have \r\nfound that the majority of these helpers are single women who \r\nneed the income, and raising children on their own, having divorced \r\ntheir previous husbands. You have to have a gentle personality \r\nand be tolerant of the elderly, and the wish to make people have a \r\nbetter day than they would on their own and go without alot of \r\nthings. The job isn\'t high paying, but usually the benefits are \r\nvery rewarding. I couldn\'t get by without this service. And I am \r\nso glad that I was able to qualify to get this in home help.          ',

	{'answer': u"\nUse a wardrobe dehumidifier - they cost about \xa320          \nthere are electric dehumidifiers - but there are also cheaper things that are - well, stuff they sell at the hardware store - a chemical, or a rock that absorbs humidity. \r\n \r\n \r\nyou might need to pub a few boxes of of baking soda in the wardrobe , too, to help get rid of the old smells.          \nIt might be caused by condensation and moisture in the air, so I would recommend opening the window for a hour or so everyday and also keep the door of the wardrobe open when you're out - that way the fresh air can circulate around the clothes. When mould forms on the wardrobe clean it off, in DIY shops you can get a spray which removes mould and stops it from forming again for a while.          \nIf you have a local pound stretcher or store the same type you can get like wee crystal packs that draw damp to them and not your clothes....or give the inside of your wardrobe a fresh coat of paint or varnish... or in more extreme case's you could get a new or second hand wardrobe..          \nget a new wardrobe          \nCan only be caused by damp.  The fabric of the building must be defective in some way.   I  have had clothes in a wardrobe in my house for over 30 years and they are still OK.  Depends if you own the house or rent it.   If rented see the landlord.  He has an obligation to supply a dry watertight dwelling.          \nCase is here that the wardrobe is probabaly against an outside wall which is getting cold, the clothes in the wardrobe are not 100%dry, the temp drops below dew point , and you got moisture. First, move the wardrobe away from the wall, fet some Polystyrene sheet put that between the wardrobe and the walls. Second, drill some vent holes in the wardobe to allow a flow of air through, ideally top and bottom, away from the wall          \nYou need to purchase a product called Damp-Rid. \r\nWorks very well and is inexpensive.          \nI've never heard of this before.  Is there damp somewhere that's causing this problem and if there is I think I would find the source of it and deal with that first and foremost.          \ndamp rid great stuff          ",

	{'answer': u"\ntake some tylenol darlin.. you'll get used to having them trust me. they feel tight now but it will get better i promise!          \nYou will just need to wait it out, when I had my braces after about 4 days the pain had gone.          \nto kill the pain take 2 paracetamol and 1 inbuprofen. it works 100% for tooth pain. \r\n \r\ni've had my braces for almost 2 and a half years now, and you will hate them even more when you get to the point where i am where your teeth are straight apart from one tiny tooth that needs moving like half a mm. which means im won't get them off til around august time. \r\n \r\nyou'll get used tp them eventually, don't worry.          \nI got them recently and take some Advil or Tylenol it kinda relieves the pain but don't eat anything hard! If you're hungry eat some pudding or oatmeal. Think about how your even your teeth are going to look like.          \nIn less than a week the pain will go away. You'll barely notice that they're on. If they're digging into your cheek, get some wax and put it on the spiky bit. \r\n \r\nRemember to clean them thoroughly using interdental sticks, if you don't you'll get nasty stains.          \nI had braces for two years. I know it sucks and is miserable. I suggest eating Speggetio's for a few weeks, they don't need to be chewed and can taste good too. \r\n \r\nI suggest getting LOTS of wax so you don't cut your lips/cheeks...you will need it for a while and then you will get used to it. \r\n \r\nAlso try having asprin for the first week, it will give you sinus headaches and tension in your head and that will help. \r\n \r\nYou'll probably hear this alot (i did): But it may hurt now and suck, but in the long run you will have beautiful teeth. Make sure to keep up on whatever the ortho says...I didn't listen and ended up having them for six more months          \nI got my braces put on about two months ago and know exactly what you are talking about. You have to keep in mind the benefits of braces and that will help you to endure (at least it helps me). You have to also keep wax at all times, put the wax on were you feel sharp edges and take tylenol when the pain is unbearable.          \nUse Orthidontic Wax          \nha...oh the joys of braces.  \r\nI got braces for the same reason you did. My teeth were straight as well..my i didnt have an overbite...my teeth sat right on top of each other and it was wearing down my top front teeth so bad that they were really sensative! \r\nWell, worst case scenario, i got braces and the first couple days were horrid!! i got my braces on and didnt get to eat lunch that day, i came home and got home at 2:30 in the afternoon and tried to eat a hot pocket and my teeth were so sore i cried! I had a volleyball game that night (i was a Junior in high school when i got mine on). I played varsity and i played my best game that night (not that that had anything to do with it, just saying) and after about 3 days, the pain went away.  \r\nWhen you go to the orthodontist is hurts for about 1-3 days afterwards depending on what you have done. It sucks! I know it does!!!!! You will get through it and the pain will go away. I tried taking EVERYTHING to make my headaches and pain go away, nothing worked so i just had to stick it out! \r\nI got my braces off the day before my senior prom and my teeth looked great! \r\nI had so much damage to my two front teeth though that i had to get plastic veneers put on my front teeth. They look amazing!! I promise in the end, everything is worth it..the pain, the headaches, the embarrassment of eating and getting stuff in your braces...it sucks, but you will be 100% happy with your smile when you get them off! :)          \nUSE SOME ANBESOL! It works! \r\nI got braces 4 days ago and that was the first thing i got my mom to buy, \r\nIt comes in a gel or liquid! \r\n \r\nHope I helped!          \ni used paramol (liquid) bcuz panadol didnt work 4 me  \r\nye i thought braces were cool at first lol (&glasses) \r\nand try gargling with warm salt water...it helps a bit \r\nhope they stop hurting          ",

	{'answer': u'\nturn up the heat.....I love it, I grow Naga chillies...they are amazing!          \nhot, hot :)          \nNot at all Lily. I consider myself lucky - my hubby can\'t either. \r\n \r\nVery mild is good for me - almost bland. \r\n \r\nI do have a very sensitive stomach and can\'t take the heat. \r\nDeeJay          \nI thought that was really interesting, though my personal interest is \'academic\' rather than practical, cos I can\'t eat chili peppers (acid reflux) though I truly love the taste and flavour. \r\n \r\nWe\'ve been to Thailand a few times and you tend to need to learn real quick to say, \'Mai Pet..! Mai Sai Plik..!\' which means \'NOT HOT..! NO CHILI Peppers..!\' otherwise they serve you food which explodes in your mouth like a hand grenade..!  \r\n \r\nThe locals round these parts commonly nosh on street food and one favourite is Felafel, balls of chick-peas, deep fried and served in a pita-bread. They spread an evil-looking red paste made with chili peppers on it, called Suhug and that too is lethal..!  \r\n \r\nOne thing I do indulge in the a tiny addition of Tabasco and I like that cos I can moderate the exact amount of \'spicy\' without it being dangerous. I also like it for another reason. The MacIlhenny Family donate serious sums to the USMC because one of their family was a famous marine general. I like then for that too.          \nNot hot. I like to experience flavors not suffer an endurance test. If I want to burn my tongue, I\'ll heat a fork on the stove and stick it in my mouth.          \nSorry to answer this question like a food snob,which I\'m not.But in my opinion too much heat ruins the taste of food.I like spicy food but only if the peppers accentuate the flavor. \r\n \r\nBut I can take the heat.Give the hottest salsa anytime.          \nHmm - I have vague and somewhat nasty recollections - of sticking my head down a toilet bowl and then standing open-mouthed - under a cold shower - for a full 30 minutes. \nAFTER some stupid \'hostess\' got her recipes in a right royal muddle - going very heavy-handed with the hot chilli pepper stuff. \nA late arrival - feeling in more need of food than drink - I took a few spoonfuls of the hostess\'s best (ill-prepared) mixes of hot spicey stuff. \nAs a welcomed guest - I managed to smile for 4 or 5 minutes - even though my tongue. throat and larynx semed to be being incinerated - by the 1st spoonful. \nSome 6 or 7 minutes into this Cocktail Party - the 2nd spoonful seemed to be doing a lot of mischief to both the lower reaches of my alimentary canal - and my spinal column. \nPHEW - sticking my head down a toilet bowl wasn\'t QUITE what I was looking forward to - when accepting the kind invitation. \nMy hostess admitted she might have got her recipes a bit muddled up - and when I left - around 9-30 pm - insisted I MUST come again - for her next party - which I promised to do. \nLYING through my frozen/volcanically blitzed teeth. \n \nHmm - it nearly blew my head off, Lily - but the collateral damage was limited to serious loss of hair -from the age of 40-something. \n; ))          \nNeither my wife or I like heavy spices, and yet our children love them!......          \nI\'m with Thomas - my kids think "the hotter the better !", while I am happy with no hot things at all.          \nMild only for me, spicy food gives me chronic indigestion, I\'m quite willing to admit I can\'t take it.          \nLily, I know how you feel.  My stomach will no longer tolerate the monster peppers.  I used to love jalapenos in Mexican food and chili, and now they give me fits.  If your hubby wants his food blazing hot, then add some to his plate and keep yours mild.  Also, keep the Pepto handy.  It will cool the burning.  Good luck!          \nI am a medium sort of fellow. \r\n \r\nThose in the picture look really aggressive. \r\nScotch Bonnet is way too hot for me.          \nI can\'t take anything much hotter than a green jalape\xf1o, while hubby loves them the hotter the better. He does suffer the after-effects, though, heh, heh.          \nI like it hot, but not that hot. I grow Tabasco peppers and make my own sauce which is quite a bit hotter than the Tabasco brand sold in stores.I also like to taste the food, that\'s why I like it hot, peppers add wonderful flavor.We also grow jalapenos and make cheese stuffed peppers we keep in the freezer. \r\nSeems like a new "hottest pepper comes out every year lately.The Ghost pepper (Bhut Jolika) set the record a few years ago and then the Naga Viper came along.(It was grown in England) Now this one.How hot can they get?          \nWe both don\'t like spicy food at all!! \r\nWe like to taste the food. \r\nI have acid reflux and can\'t handle spicy food.=)          \nGrowing up with Thai food, I love hot.  There was a time when I can handle it better than I do now.  I was in a jalapeno eating contest with a friend of mine once, and we ended it tied.  Now, I couldn\'t do it.  In fact, those peppers in your link looks like the ones I am growing in a pot outside.  I thought that they were bell peppers.  My husband took one and bit into it.  He about died.  He said that they were the hottest peppers he\'d ever eaten.  I laughed and called him a wuss.  A week later he was still talking about it and so I took one and bit into it.  It tasted like a bell pepper.  He did the same and said that this one was different.  He then said for me to eat the top and I did.  I just about died.  It was the hottest thing I ever ate.  lol.          \nI don\'t think I will be growing any of those, although I did find the seeds at the Chili Pepper Institute. I like a little spice, but I don\'t think I\'d like a plant where the fruit burns through latex gloves! \r\n \r\nI do like a little \'bite\' of spice; chilis and other peppers. I like \'medium\' hot; enough to feel it but not enough to totally overwhelm my mouth. My husband likes more heat than I do and so does my dad. \r\n \r\nMy dad always had red pepper flakes on the table, and he\'d use the pepper on just about any savory dish. My husband likes the red pepper flakes too. We typically have 3 or 4 bottles of chili sauce around the house; tastes and heat vary depending on the type. We use every thing from smoked paprika, fresh ground black pepper, cajun spices, italian peppers, to fresh peppers that we grow. We even like Korean kimchee....with rice....:) \r\n \r\nI\'ve grown habaneros, serranos, jalapenos, and poblanos in a large pot in front of my house. The chilis are free for the picking for any of my neighbors. I\'m trying to decide which peppers to grow this year. Poblanos are my favorite, but I need some with more heat for my husband and neighbors. \r\n \r\nThanks for the link, Lily!          \nI have developed a sensitivity to hot peppers, can\'t tolerate it now and will suffer heartburn for a week. I used to love going to an Indian restaurant and eating a variety of spicy dishes.          \nMy hubby won\'t try anything spicy at all. \r\nMe - I just like mild to medium hot.  I cannot eat Indian food at all.  I have tried two different dishes in Indian restaurants, many years apart, and I was actually physically sick after each one.  So, I\'ve got the message now and just don\'t eat Indian.          \nI love hot spicy foods but like you, still want to be able to taste the other ingredients, not burn my taste buds off. \nI love Thai foods and anything with chilli in it. \nJust recently we have discovered curries, love them. \nI like Mexican food but my husband doesn\'t  so I don\'t eat that very often. \nHungarian foods can be very hot and spicy, their fish soup comes in different levels of hot. \nOnce when we were young and living on Maui, my husband took our then 1 year old son to visit a house where his 5 to 6 single male friends lived near the beach. \nMore of a crash pad then a house. \nThese crazy Hungarin guys would cook  a huge pot of food for the day and most of these guys were from the countryside of Hungary where they love very hot foods. \nOne of those "idiots" gave my son a chilli pepper to eat and being just a baby it went straight into his mouth. \nPoor thing, I almost killed my husband when I found out what happened and he was banned from taking out son to that house again. \nHave just discovered a nice sweet and hot sauce from Thailand that I am putting on almost everything, it is call Mae Ploy sauce. \nGrew up in S. Calif. and have lived in New Mexico for a few years, love green chilli Mexican style foods, too bad my family isn\'t on board with that.          \nIf the top of my head isn\'t damp and the sweat isn\'t dripping of the back of my head, it\'s not spicy enough.  Wednesdays at work is NACHOS DAY (nachos, beans/hamburger mixture, shredded cheese with condiments on the counter).  I get a small portion and doctor it up.          \nI never liked hot food at all.  It always hurt my throat          \nI have never liked painful eating!          \nHello dear Lily, I like mine mild!   I love Franks Hot Sauce, but I don\'t over do it! \r\nI like spicy food, but like you, not that spicy!  xo ox          \nGive me hot food HOT !!  \r\nIt does not take away from the taste and flavour of the food ,and once you are used to the heat, you can taste the flavour of the chili .YUM.          \nNot hot nor spicy. I have a bad cold just now and have a nose bleed, so bleeding to death. You have reminded me I haven\'t had dinner so time to have it. Thanks for the reminder as I don\'t feel much like eating.          \nI\'m a huge fan of the scoville scale          \nNO, a little spicy that\'s it!I want flavor not heat!          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Hubby can take his food a lot spicier than me as I only like my curries or chilli medium to hot but neither of us would dare to try anything with these little monsters added. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI prefer to taste the food and not have my head blown off, how about you, can you take the heat?

	{'answer': u'\nMilk, butter and meat from the \'fridge. \r\nCoffee, bread, potatoes and vegetables from the cupboard.          \nCOFFEE !!!          \nCat food would be the first to come to mind. \r\nBut as far as human consumption I would not like to see my utility cart stocked with beans and vegetables. \r\n \r\nRefrigerated items I would not like to run out of are my low cal energy drinks and of course wine.          \nMilk, coffee, sugar, butter,,,I stock up on every time I go to the store,,oh, and toilet paper, cannot run out of that.          \nsoda , pizza,  eggs , sausage , bread and milk          \nCoffee in the morning, and a beer in the evening. There\'s always some sort of food in the fridge, but it doesn\'t really matter what it is. That\'s just fuel for the boiler, LOL.          \nGood one, yes milk for me too. I keep powdered milk on hand just in case. I\'ve started buying frozen bread dough as I waste stale bread. I can go without tea or coffee but not at the same time.          \nWater is number one, but coffee and creamer would be sorely missed.          \nI\'m fairly adaptable.  If we\'re out of an item, I can easily substitute-no problem.  My husband, however.........."I want what I want when I want it."          \nI was gonna say coffee but a bunch of folks beat me to it. \r\nOf course I don\'t like to run out of anything but I can survive as long as I have coffee.          \ncoffee \r\nclassic coke \r\nEnglish muffins          \nI\'m a milkaholic and i hate it when i\'m out.          \nI always try to have onions,eggs,butter,bread, tea and milk oh,and cheese.I could manage quite nicely with these items for quite a while.          \nGreen tea, fresh fruit especially lemons & grapefruit, onions & garlic (most of my main dishes  have those in it), eggs          \nEggs, potatoes, bread, peanutbutter.          \nI always have the basics in - milk, bread, coffee, tea, toilet paper and vodka with diet cola or irn bru to add to it. \r\nI don\'t buy bottled water as, living in Scotland, we have great water straight from the tap.          \nNo matter what.....I have to have coffee....some form of milk to put in it.    Past that,   if I had to keep it down to a bare minimum....I would have to have eggs,  butter,  at least one kind of brick cheese.....and a few apples...and a sack of fresh salad/spinach. \r\n \r\nI could "make do" with that for a good while....but,  of course,  would miss the other things. \r\n \r\nFunny,  isn\'t it.....how much food and how much variety of it we have all gotten accustomed to and take for granted?          \nSame as you and fish and meat.          \nI concur with your list exactly Lily.          \ntea, chocolate, bread and butter          \nI always feel better when my cupboards are full. \r\nmakes the world seem safer somehow. \r\nCoffee, water, bread are must haves also I hate to run out of TP.          \nChocolate and water. Oh, and pasta.          \nAs I was reading through  the answers, I have noticed that seniors don\'t need much meat as long as they have milk, eggs, cheese. We always have some sort of meat in our freezer, we never run out. But we rush to the grocery store, when we are low on fruits, nuts and prunes.          \nCoffee, beer & Hamburger Helper.          \nTea bags and peanut butter.  Can\'t possibly do without either of those.          \nMeats  \r\nrice \r\nwater \r\npasta          \nIt would be panic time if I ran out of coffee, tea, sugar and creamer.  I can get low on everything else but not those.  And as far as going hungry I know I am never destitute as long as I have bread and peanut butter and jelly.          \nHi Lily.....Milk and Coffee. It\'s almost panic time when those are missing. lol....          \nLea & Perrins\'s Worcestershire Sauce          ',

	 'question': u'\n    This is a letter to a good friend in South America. She is a female, and we use the informal tense in Italian, and would do the same in Spanish. \r\n Thanks a lot for your help! \r\n \r\n \r\n"I hope everything is good for you, and you are not too busy! I do nothing but study all week. University has so much freedom, it\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t experience it because I always have my nose in a book!  In general, I am very well and I am getting ready for Christmas break. Erica is studying Italian, and has a very good accent.  It will be strange but wonderful to be in Sicily again, but I don\u2019t think it will be the same without you. My contact with Lisa has been limited, as we both have busy lives and are growing apart. I hope that we can keep in touch though, because I valued your friendship. I think soon we should begin to plan when we will travel. Will you come to New York? It would be a dream for me.  I hope to come to Bolivia during the Easter vacation.  After Christmas we will talk seriously about these things. Now of course I know that you are occupied with Mauro\u2019s impending visit, and I must plan my trip in Italy.  How is your family? I hope they are well.  My father is marrying his girlfriend, Lillian. They announced this a few days ago. I am happy, but it will be a change. Everything changes, with time. I\u2019m sure it is the same way in Bolivia J.  \r\n \r\nAs always, I miss you and can\u2019t wait to hug you again.  \r\n \r\nYour American friend who loves you, \r\nA"  ',

	{'answer': u'\nEn este sobre encontrar\xe1s fotos de mi vida: mi universidad, mi perro, mis amigos, \xa1y nosotros en Sicily!  \xa1Espero que te gusten, y espero que un d\xeda pronto puedas ver estes lugares y personas! \r\nLa escuela todavia es alucinante.  Tengo la libertad completa, que es muy buena para m\xed.  Me gusta mucho.  Estes d\xedas tengo mucho sue\xf1o.  Tengo que estudiar mucho para ser un estudiante bueno, y la mejoria de las noches no puedo dormir mucho.  \xbfEst\xe1s estudiendo mucho t\xe1mbien?  Cualquier que est\xe1s haciendo, espero que est\xe9s bien.  Pareces estar feliz cuando te hablo en el tel\xe9fono, y espero que contin\xfae.  He mantenido en contacto con Lisa, pero no tanto que me gustar\xeda, y no tanto que contigo.  Distancia es dif\xedcil para amistades.  Pero espero que no nos haga nada.  No creo que ser\xe1 problema. \r\n \r\nComo siempre, te echo de menos y siempre pienso en ti.  La pr\xf3xima vez que te veo ser\xe1 un momento feliz para m\xed. \r\n \r\n\xa1Di hola a tu familia para m\xed!  \xa1Y Tuffy! \r\n \r\n \r\nNotes: \r\n-Only use this if you are on first name terms with the person you are writing to.  Spanish uses multiple words for \'you,\' and from the way you phrased the question I gather that your friend is similar to you in age.  The best approximation is that if you would use Mr./Mrs. in English, you would use the polite form, and not the form in this translation. \r\n-I had to change the wording slightly in a few places- most notably "I do not believe it will" cannot be left without a verb there in Spanish- the translation reads "I do not believe it will be a problem." \r\n-I assume Tuffy is the name of a pet, but if not, I cannot think of a case where you would have to change the wording. \r\n-You did not provide your gender or your friend\'s, which matters grammatically in Spanish much more than English.  I avoided phrases that would need to be changed though, so you should be okay either way. \r\n-You should probably start you letter with Querido (male friend\'s name) or Querida (female friend\'s name), meaning Dear _____, and end with Atentemente, (your name) meaning Sincerely. \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd wait a minute...If you talk to them on the phone, they must speak English...?

I hope you like them, and I hope that one day soon you can see these places and these people!  \r\nSchool is still amazing. I have complete freedom , which is very good for me . I like it a lot. In these days I am very tired. I must study a lot in order to be good at school, and so I stay up late most nights. Are you studying a lot too? Whatever you are doing, I hope you are doing well. You seem happy when I speak to you on the phone, and I hope it continues.   I have been keeping contact with Lisa, but not as much as I would like to, and not as much as I do with you. Distance is difficult for friendships. But of course I hope it does nothing to us. I do not believe it will. \r\n \r\nAs always, I miss you and think of you always. When I see you next will be a happy moment for me. \r\n \r\nSay hello to your family for me! And tuffy!" \r\n  ',

	{'answer': u'\nFrankie and bennies new yorker burger yum          \nI don\'t have a spescific favourite these days, but I\'d like a cod n chips, or flame grilled chilli burger, or steak n chips with chilli sauce, curry chicken, spag bol. any of these would be nice.          \nWell I would like some more of the roasted chestnuts, but as there were only 9  \r\nin Saturday\'s bag, they are long gone. \r\n \r\nA middling size glass of mulled wine and a hot bacon sandwich would work wonders \r\nright now, Lily. \r\n \r\nTo digress slightly, you can do your own chestnuts in the oven, rather like baked  \r\npotatoes, they taste OKish, but not as good as those eaten on a cold frosty day, \r\nwhere ambience and atmosphere and a hot brazier play a part.          \nA large "Special" from the Pizza Paddle in Delta, Ohio. I`ve been overseas now for going on 7 years, and there`s pizza in Japan, but it ain`t like home.          \nA cheese salad sandwich in brown bread. \r\n \r\nHey presto I open my lunch box and there one is, our lass is magic. \r\n \r\nNow for the coffee and a few wine gums for dessert LOL.          \nMy wife just brought me a cup of coffee.It\'s early morning here right now so I would like a big breakfast to magically appear.I\'m thinking bacon,eggs,grits,biscuits and gravy.Hocus pocus.Darn the magic didn\'t work.          \nNo thank you!, full as a gun, had porridge this morning....          \nNothing thank you. I just ate breakfast a big bowl of oat meal with raisins whole wheat toast with blue berry jam and a pot of coffee and couldn\'t eat another bite.          \nA low fat warm blueberry scone to go along with my green tea before I go to work.All suggestions sound great so far.          \nIt\'s early morning and I\'m on my first cup of coffee and I\'m thinking a huge stack of pancakes with warm syrup would be delicious.          \nIt\'s not quite 6AM here in Phoenix, and I have what I want right in front of me....my cup of coffee.  I don\'t usually eat first thing in the morning, but if I were to desire something in the next hour or so it would be a stack of homemade waffles with plenty of butter and whipped cream with strawberries.          \nI am just about to partake of a hot drink and 2 paracetamols - does that count?  Can\'t shift this cold.          \nI\'m gonna agree with you on the chestnuts (love them! one of the favorite memories with my mom) and a big glass of apple cider!          \nMolten Chocolate Lava Cake, with chocolate oozing. \r\n \r\nYum Yum          \nIt\'s almost 9 a.m. and have had my coffee. A Belgian waffle with whipped cream and strawberries would be a wonderful breakfast.          \nWell, since it is morning and I just finished two slices of zucchini bread, I\'m really not hungry.  But if I was hungry fried chicken (dark meat) and a hot fudge sundae would be delicious...          \nI don\'t need anything right now -- I just finished a bowl of spicy hot beef stew -- but I\'ll take a piece of buttermilk pie for later.          \nThe shwarma that my driver is supposed to be bringing me as I am stuck at home with a chill. \n \nHe had better not have forgotten if he values his life! \n \nAddition: 5 Minutes later:Life just got its smile back. He brought it!          \nWhen I woke up I would have liked to snap my fingers and I would have a cuppa made just the way I like at exactly the right temperature. \r\n \r\nIt is one of those things I miss the most now, not that I got many made before, but they were always nice, and seldom thanked for as much as pleasure would give to me now.          \nMmmmm....A creamy bowl of Lobster Bisque with a Buttermilk Biscuit. ("Pretending not to have food allergies) :)          \nIt\'s a.m here now and I don\'t usually eat breakfast. I have my coffee and I would like someone to keep bring me new hot coffee but I\'m alone and have to jump up and get it myself...bummer.          \nHello Lily, Roasted Chestnuts was my Mom\'s favorite, she loved them! \r\nI haven\'t had them for years! \r\n \r\nI would love a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of soup! \r\n \r\nIts lunch time!  I am hungry, No breakfast for me                 XO XO          \nA bite of sushi would be nice at the moment. \nHaven\'t had any for a long time. \nWe do roast chestnuts at home all the time in Hungary. They are not too expensive over there, in the states they are way over priced in the stores. \nA Hungarian very tasty but fattening desert is ground chestnut puree mixed with heavy whipping cream served cold. So very good with a glass of sweet sherry or Tokay wine which is sweet and make out of raisins. \nThe puree is sold in Hungary in the freezer section of the grocery stores, very easy to mix up at home. \nIt is put into a press with the cream so it is well blended.          \nHot, not spicy hot chili rellenos, black beans and rice. \r\nMartgueritas on the rocks.          \nBIG ole steamed lobster tail with melted butter.          \nthree arbys beef and cheddars and some crinkle fries \r\nor some fish and chips          \nAt the moment nothing - don\'t feel hungry for food.          \nI had a late lunch about 3 hrs ago.  A snack  and a cup of hot tea.... perhaps a slice of apple pie..  I think there was some left over from saturday.          \nA dinner of lobster and crab would do it for me.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    Oh I would love a bag of hot roasted chestnuts  that Malcky mentioned in his earlier post. \r\n \r\nHe's got me going so much so that I'm planning a trip into town to hunt down one of our festive sellers.... just wish I could wave a magic wand though and have some right now. \r\n \r\nSo is there anything food or drink wise that you would like to partake in right this moment ?

	{'answer': u'\nI barely get to drink 1 glass of water a day \r\n \r\njust don\'t have the memory or time          \nI tend to drink as much as I can, which is less \r\nthan 8 glasses. \r\n \r\nI drink a couple of small bottles per day, \r\nseveral cups of tea, 1 coffee, and that is \r\nabout it. \r\n \r\nI do not have the capacity to drink too much \r\nliquid.          \nDefinitely I do not!, I know I should (naughty boy?) but until I get the new washer fixed, I have to be careful.......          \nI try to. \r\n \r\nIn addition, I am reading several medical sources are recommending a glass of warm water and the juice of a whole, fresh, lemon in the morning and at night. \r\n \r\nThis appears to be a major digestive aid, cuts the acidity of your system, helps clean you out, improves skin tone, is a great diet aid, provides substantial vitamin c and other benefits. The recommendation is to drink a glass a half hour before eating in the morning, and right before bed. \r\n \r\nYou might want to search your own favorite medical sites to confirm this..          \nI think so, especially if the water has had more than a passing acquaintance with some hops.          \nI really do not get eight glasses of water a day. I must admit I drink a lot of tea when I should be drinking water.          \nWater is boring, I drink coffee, punch, beer, whiskey, and milk. I do have a glass of water on my night stand because if I don\'t I will wake up in the middle of the night dying of thirst.  As long as it is there I never have need of it though.          \nIts all we are drinking beer is too expensive, unless we turn too petrol which is cheaper than beer.          \nYes, plus milk, Gatorade, coffee, teas and juices. \r\nKeeps my joints and muscles happy.          \nYes I drink that much and more. \r\nWater does help the complexion. I was told by my doctor that I needed to drink more water dues to the dry skin I am having and yes it does cleans out the kidneys. \r\nWhen they are referring to 8 glasses it mean 1 cup of water, so really that is not a lot. I keep a 16oz glass nearby and refill and drink from it all they long.          \nit\'s a load of rubbish. If you sweat you want to drink more. Any drink be it fuit jiuce tea or coffee (yuk) \r\ncounts as water. Alcoholic drink doe snot          \nI do drink enough water, I know because if I don\'t I get a headache that doesn\'t stop until I drink a liter or more. In this 100 F. degree heat (which returned to the area this week) I keep a glass of water with me throughout the day. I get my water filtered and drink nearly a gallon a day at home besides what I drink at work (4-5 glasses or more)          \nYes but most of it is in coffee and tea. As it is I can\'t walk past a rest room without leaving some  behind.          \nI have heard that the eight glasses a day thing doesn\'t hold "water" any more, lol. You can become overhydrated, and there is such a thing. I probably don\'t drink actual water, but I do drink a lot of iced tea made with gallon jugs of spring water, because our tap water is too horrible to contemplate drinking. I\'m sure you\'re doing fine, Lily, and I also keep a glass on my bedstand.          \n"Power" gave you the correct equation.  That includes ONLY water.  Even tea or coffee goes through the digestive tract before hitting your kidneys.  Water is the only thing that is not digested, so it goes directly to your kidneys.   \r\nPersonally, I drink WAY MORE than the minimum.  I drink about 2 gallons of water a day.          \nI drink 8 glasses a day, but sadly I don\'t see or feel any benefits that they go on about. I WISH My skin would improve, as well as my digestion, but I need Prune Juice for that!          \nWater is good.  Living Water is better.          \nI make far more water than I drink Lily. \r\n \r\nPerhaps it\'s an age thing. \r\n \r\nGiven the choice, I\'d prefer to drink brandy. Pity it doesn\'t come out of the taps.          \nI think I am drinking enough,but not 8 glasses a day,although I have tried it. Water when you arent thirsty can be hard to get down and make you feel sick. I try to drink fruit juice or smoothies.          \nIt is recommended we drink the equivalent of 8 glasses of water a day, most will come from food and other drinks.  \r\nI will have a glass of water once or twice a week          \nProbably not Lily,it\'s still cold and drinking water does not appeal at all,different though in the warmer and hot weather,my doc told me that if your wee is practically colour and odourless, you are drinking enough water, no need to count glasses.          \nIt depends on your doctor.  Some tell me water, some tell me any fluids count, some tell me 8 glasses if you sweat or get hot.  Most tell me to try to stay hydrated.          \nAlways -          \nYes, I drink lots of water.  I have been aware of how important it is for a very long time and try to encourage others to drink water.          \nI am diabetic and dehydration is a very serious issue with this condition. I live in a very hot region. So, yes, I do see to it that I drink sufficient water. And even more important, I do not spend money on boutique water. I do have a filter in my fridge, but tap water is often better than what you get from the bottle because it is fluoridated.          \nAfter suffering from kidney stones twice in which one was the size of a golf ball, and had to be removed surgically, you bet I drink more water. I drink at least 96 oz per day. That along with the water that is included in foods which also count for the intake per day. Green tea is a great drink my urologist says. I just can\'t seem to find one I really like.          \nHi Lily, \r\nI had an uncle that the doctor posed that question to. My uncle said that he did, and in drinking coffee. The doctor said "no, I said water". So to this doctor it had to be water. \r\nI drink several glasses of water, probably 6 on a hot day and a lot of iced tea. I drink I am guessing 150 ounces of tea in a day (yes it is a lot, but I do).  \r\nSo if I can count the tea, I get plenty of water.          \nYes - I do but I have to harp on my husband - to drink enough water. \n \nI drink 3 full large glasses a day - taking my am pills - pills with my dinner and with my before bed pills. \n \nI drink 4 to 6 cups of coffee and a large glass of Ice tea. \n My daily orange juice. \n \n------- *** The secret is - to always use a large glass for all liquids. *** ------ \n \nI - like you - take a glass of water to bed and usually drink most of it. I get a dry mouth from sleeping with my oxygen. \n \nVery good question and a good reminder. \nGood answers too. \nDeeJay.          \nI used to drink more water than I do now.  We have beautiful clear water straight from the tap here in Fife and, if we do get any really hot sunny days, I do drink more water then to quench my thirst.  However, it is only because I am thirsty.  I wouldn\'t drink water just because it is recommended I do so.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    It is recommended we drink approx 8 glasses of water a day or so we're told which I struggle with big time. \r\n \r\nWater is a must for many reasons to keep the kidneys flushed, great for the complexion, aids digestion etc.. I don't drink 8 glasses a day though but I certainly drink at least 3, mainly with meals. \r\n \r\nI also like my 2 cups of tea, 1 cup of coffee and fresh fruit juice. \r\n \r\nParty times yes I like my G&T, red or rose wine and maybe a nice cold glass of Guiness which of course is good for your iron content. \r\n \r\nI always take a glass of water to bed with me as I take my meds first thing in the morning. \r\n \r\nSo do you think you're  drinking enough water ?

	{'answer': u'\nI found mine. You know when you do because everything about the two of you just fits.          \nAn excellent example is Steve (The Crocodile Hunter) Irwin and his wife Terry.  If you\'ve never seen his bio before, take time to watch it.   \r\nWhen its right, you know!          \nTrue soul-mates WILL know it!!          \nYou just know. You will feel it, it isn\'t something that can be explained with words.          \nits just a feeling of content and security... i found him and he lived on the other side of the world. Its the best feeling, you just look at them and i dont know its a feeling i cant explain          \nPossibly, when you die...          \nthere are no doubts in your mind or heart. it took me a long time to find mine and i wasn\'t even looking. it is such a wonderful feeling, the seed of doubt, jealousy rearing it ugly head, insecurites, all of that is gone, and never appears.          \nThat\'s a good question.  I grew up believing in soul-mates but then, after many r\'ships and heartbreaks, I lost that belief.  I thought...."how stupid it is to think there\'s only 1 person out there made just for you!"  Then, I met my husband and in 1 day, my faith had been restored.  When you meet your soulmate, something inside of you clicks and you just know it.  I can\'t describe the feeling but it\'s amazing.          \nYes, I found him in grad school.          \nthis is something you just know. I told my mom after my first date with my now husband This will be my husband some day. We have been together 13 years and married for 8 we had a very long engagement before we got married. He was in college and we wanted to make sure this was real before we said I Do. I\'m not saying you have to go turtle speed as we did but buy waiting so long we did go though a lot of things like the death of his mother for one. We overcame stuff stuff as a couple and just knew as a married couple we could overcome anything. I truly can\'t imagine my life without him in it. We have one child a daughter 3 years old and I think by waiting and not rushing into a family It helped us get to know each other as a couple than as a Family.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nTeachers are responsible for your safety.  So yes, they should watch out for you, help you in disastrous situations and such.          \nyou do know you can add details to your question right?          \nWell, you\'ll have to rely on my other answer. I haven\'t changed my mind.          \nThe teacher is probably just concerned with the safety of his students.  He knows that he is the one in charge and it is his responsibility to keep you safe.  If there was a school shooting, I think that the teacher should do whatever he can to help the students, depending on the situation.  It might not be possible to help the students get out, so he might have to just direct them and remain with the injured.  After all, as a teacher, he would be a leader, so he would have to tend to his students.          \nWell it could be he has experienced this before, and is trying to prevent it from happening again.          \nHere\'s hoping you have enough brains to figure it out yourself.   If you are at least 14, this ought to be a cinch.  If you\'re not, ask  the adult with whom you live.          \nMay be another kid in his class got hit by a car while he was in charge... i dunno.          \nYes, the teacher is there to inspire, direct and assist; but you make your choices ... and choices have consequences.   \r\n \r\nIn this situation, the teacher should direct and assist ... then "fall back" and bring the injured to safety.  You are the future.  Think about that when you interact with your teacher. \r\n \r\nMost teachers realize this more than you know.  Good teachers really care and want you to succeed.  Safety is something they help provide and too few appreciate that. \r\n \r\nTeachers want to be part of the solution for reasons you may not yet understand. \r\n \r\nHope this helps.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nI live in Kent and have very hard water.          \ni live in Wiltshire, Salisbury to be precise and the water quality is dreadful, the only thing we could do to make the water drinkable was to install a softener - it also cut down one heck of a lot on the cleaning too - less scale buildup on taps, the kettle and the shower \r\n \r\nthey are worth getting if its bad enough to see          \nI live inside the London artesian well basin and we have the hardest water in the world (it\'s physically impossible to dissolve any more calcium salts in it).  It\'s nice to know that we still lead the world in something. \r\n \r\nHave you tried an electronic water treatment unit?   It doesn\'t actually make the water any softer, but it does make the limescale easier to remove and it appears to stop the pipes furring up.          \nI\'m in Devon. Our lovely soft water is from Dartmoor or from reservoirs in the Culm Measure soil areas.  After heavy rains the rivers can run tea-coloured from the peat in their headwaters. (Photo) \r\n          \nI live in The Lake District we have the softest water in the country          \nGalilee water is very hard and we too have the problem of lime-scaling in the electric kettle and it also affects the quality of laundry.          \nI am in celtic area and the water when you open the tap  is brown quite disgusting and the taste horrible, they still they ask us to pay for the dammm thing !          \nHere in Hampshire (chalk soil) the limescale build-up is very rapid. We have a Britta water filter jug for drinking water, but the areas around taps and so on are a nightmare. Also, the soap doesn\'t lather well.          \nI have to answer your question this way: The water is so hard in my area, when swimmers dive into the lake most suffer concussions. (a little fun)          \nVery hard water. This area (Minnesota) has a lot of iron in it. There are many iron mines in the northeast part of the state. The yard at my cabin has rusty rocks in it which are rocks loaded with iron. I have to clean the stains out of the sink and around tub drain weekly. \r\n \r\nI tell people I dry my dishes with a magnet, LOL.          \nMy well is hard water so I have a water softener. I have to put softener salt in.          \nHard water here, no matter where we live it is hard water but we don\'t have any build up like you do, to get soft water here people have to buy a water softener heater etc to get soft water..I don\'t like soft water because that will cause build-up..my sister has one and I just don\'t like it or even the smell of it..I won\'t even drink it either..=)          \nWe have great water.          \nHere in Budapest we have hard water. \nHave to use things like calgon in the washer once in awhile to remove lime scales. \nThe plus side is we have a natural lake of mineral water under the whole city. \nThe spas here are probably some of the best in the world. \nI buy bottles of mineral water to drink by either the liter or 2 liter size. \nYou can also go to a couple of spas in town, bring your own bottles and have them filled up straight from the earth. \nOne spa the Rudas has 3 different kinds of mineral water for different physical aliments. \nIt is only about 25 cents a liter and well worth it. \nEven the store waters are between 25 cents to 70. a bottle, so many brands of water to buy here all have the mineral content on the bottles. \nThe Rudas spa was built by the Turks over 500 hundred years ago and much of the building still dates back that far. \nSo good for old tired joints to soak in the waters. \nOne side has a swimming pool that is half mineral water and half "normal" water. If it was all mineral it would be too hot and take too much energy away from you. \nI don\'t even know how many spas there are in this country, they are everywhere. \nwww.budapestinfo.hu \nIn Las Vegas the water was very different, you can tell when you wash your hair, it was softer and smoother in Vegas. \nThe down side here is we have to replace our water heater more often as it gets a build up of minerals over time. \nIf I forget to add fabric softener in the laundry then our towels come out like they are made from cardboard.          \nHard water here.   Limescale,  but also rust!    My neighbors have a well dug thirty years ago, and pretty deep,   the water is so full of rust it turns you hair orange after you shower in it.   It tends to clog up any water softeners.    \r\nOur well,  a mile down the road,  dug sixty years ago, and fairly shallow,  is wonderful water.   We\'re so thankful.    But even our water is more hard then soft.          \nWhen I lived in the university apartment complex we had well water, it was the softest water I ever had. I bought Kirk\'s Castile bar soap and it bubbled up like bubble bath, and when I would get my hair cut the stylists would ask what I put on my hair it was so soft.  After I moved out it was discovered that the well water there was high in arsenic, the wells were shut down and the university moved over to city water.  I have had city water for 16 years, it is hard water, I can tell in my tea kettle, have to use vinegar every once in awhile to clean the crust that accumulates in the bottom out. The worst thing is that the water from the city is high in chromium so now I have both chromium and arsenic in my body from drinking so much water.  I used a water filter since I had city water but it wasn\'t getting everything and switched over to refillable water I get from stores.  The Castile soap doesn\'t bubble up like it did at the other complex and I have to use distilled water in my iron.          \nHi, Lily, we have well water that was soft when we first moved here about seven years ago, but we must need a new well because for the last two years it has gotten worse and worse. There is always a rust build-up in my sinks. It smells terrible and therefore tastes awful. I have to use a special water softener when I wash clothes and dishes, which is expensive, and we have to buy bottled water for drinking purposes. It is on our list of "things to discuss w/landlord".          \nWe have hard mineral water in our area of Oregon.  years ago, there was a large park for camping and family fun just above us.  It was well known for it\'s mineral water, that some folks thought was healthy, so they would take jugs up there and fill with water.  Someone bought the property and it is no longer a park.  It was a fun place to go.  Hmmm, maybe we could sell our "healthy" mineral water,  haha!  It sure is hard on our hot water tank as we need to keep filters in it.  We need to use hard water cleaners as we have rust build up if we don\'t.          \nBuckinghamshire is also a hard water area, Lily. \r\nWhenever, I go back \'home\' to Yorkshire for a break \r\nwith friends, I forget that the water is so soft in \r\nHarrogate and then lather up as normal only to \r\nfind myself buried under a cover of suds and bubbles. \r\n \r\nTea tastes better too in soft water areas, giving a \r\nsoft smooth taste.          \nI live in a hard water area and use a water filter jug which improves the taste of the water, making it feel much softer to drink.  There\'s nothing wrong with drinking tap water but it can be a bit harsh. \r\n \r\nFiltered water also stops kettles from furring up which in turn saves on electricity.  The filters really do make a difference to the clarity of the tea.. I know they can be a bit pricey but I stock up when on offer.   \r\n \r\nI don\'t like the idea of using chemical descalers, I\'d waste so much water making sure I get rid of every drop which rather defeats the object.. \r\n \r\nI use a little washing soda for the laundry. \r\n \r\nI don\'t mean to sound like a sales person, it is from my experience          \nI have soft rusty water with loads of sediments and farm chemicals in it, it leaves rust stains on everything after a few months,  my showers are brown.  Have been buying bottled water to drink for 23 years...          \nWe have our own well here in Pennsylvania. Our water is considered hard.... as it was when we lived in New Jersey.          \nGuess ill be the bad guy here. Our water testing shows our water is softer than a water softener could make it. Down side is you can\'t get your clothing rinsed out completely. Up side, all you need is a very little dab of shampoo to do the job.          \nYou are lucky with just lime scale. Our water comes straight out of a mountain with high mineral content. The worst mineral is calcium. It blocks everything up where the water is heated. We have extra filters everywhere to catch it and we have to clean them regularly!          \nDoes it really matter its all wet.          \nHere in Fife, Scotland, we have beautifully clear soft water.  I love a nice glass of cold water to quench my thirst. \r\n \r\nI know your area has hard water because when we holiday on the Norfolk Broads, I always have to give the kettle a good scrub as it has limescale in it.  We never have limescale at home.          \nThere is a close correlation between hardness of water and life expectancy.  \r\nOne explanation is that the soft water areas (basically, in the island of Great Britain, the whole of the south and east of England) have deeper soil, therefore better agricultural land, therefore wealthier agriculture, and therefore, over time better everything else, particularly because our kings have always preferred to reside here and have so favoured this part of the kingdom, making it their capital and providing it with more goodies such as our two traditional universities, our capital city, etc., etc. \r\nAnother explanation is that soft water is much more likely to absorb impurities because it is not already overloaded with lime (i.e. calcium) which may mess up our kettles but is not of itself harmful, whereas the chief contaminant more likely to be taken up by soft water is lead (from what until recently was the commonest constituent of water pipes).  \r\nA third explanation is that our heaviest industries (with their adverse effect on longevity) have always been concentrated in the north and west, in which case the fact that they are in the soft water areas is pure coincidence (except that industry began with water power, always more abundant on the hilly, upper reaches of rivers, where the water would also be, naturally softer).          \nI live in a wet water area. \r\n \r\nOr am I missing something?          \nI know the Kent water...Living in the East Midlands the water is okkkk. I would not say it is as soft as Scottish water, now that\'s a treat, but its more that acceptable.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Our water here on the East coast of England is fairly hard which means annoyingly that  the limescale builds up very quickly. \r\n \r\nI have to buy costly descaling  cleaners to prevent the build up before it starts plus I find we use more soap than our lucky friends in the North of the country.  \r\n \r\nThey have lovely soft  clear drinking water which also froths up the soapy products quicker therefore saving money in the long run on those costly detergents. \r\n \r\nSo are you lucky enough to live in a soft water area or do you have to make do with the not so pure hard stuff?

	{'answer': u'\nmy girlfiend who is incidentally called Lilly tells me i drink too little. But often she phones up and tells me to drink! on those days i guess i drink  1,5 to 2 Litres.   Thats why i love her!          \nBy drinking tea and coffee you are drinking water therefore you are probably drinking sufficient water and are up to your guideline. \r\n \r\nMe? I drink my water guideline via the beer I consume each day.          \nI have 1/2 pot of coffee in morning \r\nand at least 8 12oz of water a day \r\nyou can add a twist of lemon to water for flavor..:)          \nduring the winter months i let the water intake drop somewhat,just didn\'t feel like drinking cold stuff . but am now catching up again.i do count the tea i drink as it has no sugar or milk, and some is peppermint or chamomile. coffee doesn\'t count because i have it strong with a dash of milk .i do feel much better when i remember to drink water. adding a little fruit juice (about as much as you would cordial,and no added sugar) helps the body to absorb the water and makes it taste better.          \nI drink a lot of water.  I am diabetic and learned to let go of everything else.  I have some coffee in the morning, and water the rest of the day.  I don\'t care for the taste of artificial sweeteners.  I love Coke, but never drink it anymore, unless my blood sugar drops too low, then I\'ll have a few sips to stabilize.          \nI would think so.I get mine via numerous forms such as tea and sports drinks.Plus fruits such as grapes and melons contain some water.          \nYes, Water brings life and make your fresh and healthy. We must intake at least 5-8 glass of water a day.  \r\nTea and Coffee depend on the choice.  \r\nThanks          \nI mostly just drink filtered water.Every morning I drink 2 or 3 cups filtered through ground coffee beans.  \r\nLater in the day I usually have some filtered through tea leaves.At some meals I will drink a glass of water that has been filtered through a cow.At night I sometimes have a glass of aged water that has been filtered through some grapes. \r\nI think the answer to your question would be yes.          \nI know I should drink water but I will go days and days with no plain water.  I drink my morning coffees and then have my diet drinks and the only "water" I really get is the melting ice in my Sundrop. Then I have my evening coffee after dinner.  Thanks for reminding me that I need to do much better.          \nWhen I was in Lanzarote on holiday I seemed to drink gallons of water.  Now that I\'m back home I hardly drink water at all.  I know I should, but if I\'m not thirsty I don\'t see the point.          \nI like "Larry"\'s answer. I think that is where I am on this issue philosophically. \r\n \r\nI recently heard a news item about how the "eight cups of water a day" idea is now considered bad advice. \r\n \r\nWhich makes sense to me because I would think that if you are constantly flooding your system with water, then you would be losing all the vitamins, minerals, nutrients, etc. that you go to so much trouble to put INTO your system. \r\n \r\nI myself like a regular intake of water, tea, coffee, grapefruit juice, and cabernet sauvignon.          \nYep. \r\n \r\nI drink like a fish; I reckon I must get through something like a dozen or more mugs of coffee each day, getting on for one or sometimes two litres of skinny coke and pint after pint of water out of one of those filter thingies. But I\'m quite a big bloke so I reckon it takes more to fill me up :oP \r\n \r\nAnd in recent years I\'ve found it helps to have a drink of water before a meal because I\'m definitely slowing up in terms of how much active stuff I do in a day and don\'t much like the idea of putting on any fat. \r\n \r\nI wouldn\'t mind betting that if we talk in terms of weight I drink far more than I eat. \r\n \r\nOh! And yes, I know there is some kind of theoretical minimum liquid requirement - I have a brother who is quite an accomplished body-builder; he is a personal fitness advisor, dietician and manages a full contact kick boxing team and gym. He\'s one of those sickeningly perfect specimens of humanity. He often waffles on about such things but in the end all I hear is "yortado this" and "yorta do that". \r\n \r\nThe muppet should get out more, right? :o)          \nI drink enough liquids.  I drink some water, but not necessarily just water. I drink about 8 cups of coffee, 4 cups of milk, 4 cups of various fruit juices and 2 cups green tea.          \nYes i do. After a little medical problem I had a few years back, I made myself drink more water. I carry a bottle of water with me about all the time. Six to eight bottles a day. No I\'m not wasteful. I use the same bottle all day, just refill it.          \nIf I did that, I might as well put a TV and the computer in front of the stool, because I\'d have to go that often. I\'m waiting for the announcement that says that is way too much for a day...and they will.  I have heard that coffee is actually good for me and it doesn\'t dehydrate as we\'ve been told over and over.  We\'re just guinea pigs on this planet. \r\n \r\nSecretly, I drink water when I\'m sick and need something to induce vomiting....works every time!          \nI KNOW I don\'t drink enough water! \r\nBut I have also been told to include coffee, tea (iced and hot) and other liquids in that daily liquid count. \r\nI still don\'t drink enough fluids.          \nI almost never drink water by itself. The city water here taste bad and smells like bleach. I\'ve never found a bottled water that taste any better, not even the flavored ones. I do drink plenty of other liquids through out the course of my day          \nI usually do drink allot of water. \r\nMy chiropractor said everyone drinks too little water. I told him I drink tea and juices but he said they are foods and not water. Plain old water is good for the joints. \r\nWe are lucky now here in Hungary, I purchase mineral water for about 25 cents for 2 liters. I must admit, being new here and all, I am drinking sometimes a bit more wine then water.What the heck, it\'s cold outside and we don\'t have to do anything we don\'t want to, why not enjoy a bit. \r\nWe usually go through 2 liters a day for two people , not enough. \r\nyesterday, I did drink about 2 1/2 liters of water alone. I was super thristy and laid off the wine for a day.  \r\nSounds like am an alcoholic but I am not, it\'s almost cheaper to drink wine here then water and it doesn\'t make you sick or hungover like some wines we would drink in the states, very fresh and crisp tasting.          \nI am afraid I am one of those people that drink way too little (in any form). I have my one cup of coffee in the morning, and then I will be lucky to have one more drink sometime during my day. Usually a can of Pepsi (although I haven\'t even had that in a couple of weeks). \r\n \r\nI drink water when I feel thirsty otherwise, but I know I don\'t drink enough because I mostly always feel dry. And I have no excuse for not drinking--I used to be a nurse, so I am well aware of the health issues! Just pure laziness I guess....          \nI don\'t drink as much as I should, either.  I try and drink more water then coffee, tea or pop.  I also drink cranberry juice cause I was told that it was good for your kidneys.  I only have one kidney, so I am more careful on what I drink now.          \nI drink enough to keep me close to a bathroom.  If I drank more - I\'d have to get rid of my computer chair & sit on a potty chair! \r\nThe rule I use is this...For each cup of coffee I drink - I also drink one full cup of water. \r\nI have a 4 cup max of coffee & stop by 9, then I switch to water.   \r\nThen I drink water throughout the day when I feel thirsty.          \nHi Lily... I learned, a very long time back, that there are far too many \'so called\' experts, ever ready to tell us what to do... what to think... what NOT to think OR do. \r\nA pox on all their \'houses\'. I listen to my body, and follow its advice... carefully. Everyone is entitled to their opinion... just don\'t try to ram your opinion down my throat.          \nI have to admit I do not drink the amount of water I should, but I do drink two or three bottles of diet lemonade ( small ) per day, one cup of coffee, and about three cups of tea!...          \nYes, I prefer to have my body hydrated as I dislike being uncomfortable and in pain. \r\nThe brain can give you it\'s full attention if it\'s not busy trying to warn you that your body is dehydrated.          \nNo, I don\'t. Our tap water tastes bad. I hope to goodness iced tea counts. It masks the taste of the water or else I use jugs of water from the grocery store (99\xa2, fairly cheap). \r\n \r\nI just took your quiz and I\'m supposed to drink 1.8 liters per day. If the tea counts, which it seems to, I drink an adequate amount.          \nI have a water-filter pitcher and probably drink 6-8 glasses a day on top of coffee and tea. If I don\'t I can feel it in my kidneys and go get a couple glasses and drink it down.  One and a half liters is not enough for me, especially in hot weather or when I have been doing strenuous work. Some days over a gallon.          \nI don\'t drink the recommended amount.  I\'d float away.  I drink some each day and am trying to drink more.  I can tell when I haven\'t been drinking enough.  I get sore and I get headaches.          \nI have read that One should drink approximate 1/2 of their body weight in ounces everyday. For example, If One weighs 150 lbs then 75 ounces of drink water is suggested.  When I gained weight,  i did not make the added adjustment so I am slightly behind each day. I should be drinking approx. 10 - 11 glasses of water each day according to the suggestion.  When I worked, I kept a 1/2 gallon bottle near that I would pour out a glass unitl it was all done at the end of the shift.          \nEww..I can`t drink plain water. I drink about 5 or 6 mugs of differing flavoured liquids a day. Bovril, lemon tea, Earl grey, coke, rose hip tea, orange juice...          ',
	 'question': u"\n    According to the 'guidelines'  my personal intake should be 1.1/2 litres a day. \r\nWell I have to admit  I'm  way under that. \r\nYes I drink the occasional tumbler but I do like something added to taste. \r\n I also prefer to have my cups of tea and one coffee a day. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nDid you know we were supposed to have a daily requirement, if so do you drink it?

	{'answer': u"\nYes, I drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses a day.  I think it is extremely important.  In fact, a physician once told me that when you become thirsty, even just a little thirsty, you are actually dehydrated at that point.  I just always have a glass of water close by and in the car I have a bottle of water and just automatically sip it at every stop light.  I also know where the ladies room is in every store that I shop at!!!          \nyou need water to live though not everyone drinks it on it's own and you don't have to,i'm 62 and healthy, i don't know how you can love water,it's tasteless, i drink it mostly with squash, tea etc.          \nYou are right, I have known people who don't drink water and always drink coffee, tea and soft drinks, and they get kidney stones. One had them 3 times, 3 surgeries and complications the first two times.  Another had bladder cancer when she got older. Drinking enough water not only helps prevent kidney stones , it helps to prevent constipation, removes toxins from the liver, helps with metabolism, and is one of the best things to slow down wrinkles on the skin.          \nI drink water but not a lot, I prefer tea, coffee and diet coke.          \nNot nearly enough. As crazy as it sounds, I had surgery three years ago for a hiatal hernia. The procedure that was done left me with a small stomach, and less craving for some foods and liquids. Before that surgery, (which was a Godsend,) I drank at least 8 glasses of water and green tea a day. Now I have to remind myself to drink any, and then I may only drink a few ounces of water. I know how important it is, but it is almost as the idea of just drinking it alone is apalling. I can drink it when I eat, so I try to do so, but I admit I am terrible about not drinking enough. My mother had kidney disease and on dialysis. She hardly ever drank water all her life, but when she went on dialysis, and was told her fluid intake was mimimal, she began craving water. I suggest those of us that do not drink enough do so. One day we may wish we had it! It does help hyrdate the skin also. I'm going just as I finish this to get a big glass to sit by my computer. It is a habit that needs to be started immediately. Thanks for your question as a reminder.          \nCorona Gold is my choice. Water's fine to, but I use Crystal Lite Peach tea in it.          \nNever touch the stuff, I drink lots of liquids, coffee,coke,beer,run. Me no like.          \nI don't drink water, get it all from coffee, diet pepsi, or what else I drink. \r\nThere is nothing wrong with this, [I have researched] But its still a good idea to drink water if you can. I have never had any problems, [67] no stones or bladder problems.          \nInteresting Q. I do drink water. I find that many times when I think I'm hungry I'm really thirsty. But too much water at one time makes me sick to my stomach, always has. I have no idea why. I could never drink a glass at one sitting          \nCoffee, Tea, Crystal Light, etc. are all made from water. I don't understand why drinking that stuff isn't considered drinking water.It's 99.9 % water anyway. My husband never drinks water. Never has and he hasn't been in the hospital ever.          \nYes but prefer my beer.          \nI used to drink primarily sodas, until Diabetes II came to visit. Now I drink only water, unsweetened fresh iced tea and black coffee. \r\n \r\nI drink 48 -64 oz of water a day and find it helps in digestion; weight loss and energy          \nYes I drink lots of water each day.          \nYep, I drink lots of water. And I'm always reminding my husband to drink water also. I also told him yesterday he was drinking too much caffeine--colas and ice tes. He said people need a certain amount of caffeine--not so I told him.          \nAlmost exclusively, lots and lots of it.          \nI love water. I used to drink more when I was more active. Sometimes I have to remind myself. I rarely drink soft drinks, could count a years worth on one hand.          \nI don't much care for water.  Never have, but I drink it as a matter of discipline.  I mostly drink decaffeinated tea.   \r\n \r\nA few weeks ago a friend gave me a glass of crushed ice with a little lemon water and twist of lemon in it.  I've been looking for some sort of ice crusher.  I could drink that easily. \r\n \r\nShe makes these citrus flavored waters by boiling citrus peels in a quart of water just like you would if you were making tea.   She also does this with peach peels and pits--haven't tried that.  She doesn't add any sugar or sweetner.          \nHave had 6 glasses today, will drink more because I walked 3 miles in the heat. Caffeine is very dehydrating, and flushes the minerals out of your body.          \nWater is my beverage of choice and has been my entire life.  Sometime ago it was on the news that a woman had consumed too much water and died.  After that I have see different segments on TV where doctors have said as long as you eat fresh fruits and vegetables that are made up of water (like apples vs bananas) you don't need to overload on water.  I have never been fond of salt so I don't go overboard with sodium, but anyone who does needs to drink a lot of water and cut way down on sodium.          \nI do and I also make water.          ",
	 'question': u'\n    I know several people that never drink water.  I love water and always have some close by.  Sometimes I warn others that they will regret not drinking water when they get older.  Am I right?  Has anyone gone a lifetime and never drank water and it not effect your health?  Thanks!  ',

It's been a while since I did more than take messages or write lists by hand....          \nI used to do that years ago, but thanks to the email age so much faster!!!          \nyess          \nI write it but I don't send it to anybody... I just write instead of saying how I really feel lol I'm lame xD          \nI still do, I often write my hubby love letters.          \nJust in the sand. \r\n          \nI preferred to be there on place of wasting paper and ink.          \nYES in deed, but only a rare times, because if you do it to much the value of it goes down. and writing a love letter is so much better because its just more work. more work = more love \r\n \r\nmoney = the easy way out.          \nI sure do! - I mainly write Thank you letters though. To the teachers, whom have done so much for me and I write them saying thanks. It's my way of telling them how much I am grateful for how they helped me to grow.  Friends, who have been there for me through the rough times. \r\n \r\nI love writing letters = ), I love receiving them too. You dont get letters by hand too often.          \nI wrote one on my first day at secondary school.  Her dad found it, took it to my headmaster and he read it out in assembly. Then he canned me!          \nI do write to my partner.  I also put poetry together and send it to him the old fashioned way, in an envelope, with a stamp and put it in the post box.  How quaint is that?          \nYes I do. I also write love notes and put them in my fiance's lunch box, on his pillow, in his sock drawer, or where ever he will find them. I put them in different places so that he never know when or where he will find one.          \nI have been in relationships where I used to write letters and say lovely things and write poems and all sorts of things. I am a romantic type so I would do it again with the right person why not.

	{'answer': u'\nI\'m not a senior, I am 28 years old. However I like a firm mattress that is a little soft.          \nwell to be honest i would love a soft snugly  type mattress but my back rebels every time i sleep in one... \r\n \r\nwe have a pillow top that gives some softness but is firmer under it ....i probably change every 15 years          \nHi Lily, hope you had a very nice time too!! We have to have extra firm mattress, if it too soft we have a hard time getting out of it!!..=)          \nI would never be able to get out of bed,it must be a firm mattress          \nI like a firm mattress.          \nFirm mine is 10 years old and should be replaced.          \nIf I don\'t have a firm mattress I can\'t sleep.          \nmedium firm. apparently a very firm mattress isn\'t good for your back. i have a friend who takes her mattress with her wherever she goes on holiday. it\'s called a "memory mattress", i think. my memory isn\'t quite as good as the mattress\'s.          \nI have a firm mattress!, I would prefer a soft one, but it would give me more pain!, and like most men I can not stand it!......          \nHi Lily, and welcome back. Truthfully, what ever is under me is fine. My wife though wants a firm mattress. I am one of those that is awake 8 to 10 times a night, so it really don\'t matter.          \nNo mattress - but a water bed.  I first got one when I had a bad back - I was surprised when friends told me to get a water bed for that problem. I thought a firmer mattress would be better. But they were so right ! I got that first water bed about 20 years ago, and never looked back. The comfort is phenomenal ! When hb and I got together 8 years ago, we went bed shopping and I was pleased to hear him say "I love a water bed". They are the best !          \nHi, Lily, welcome back, I missed your daily question. I like a firm mattress myself. I would love to be able to afford one of those sleep-number beds that adjust to each partner\'s preference, but they are very expensive at least to me they are.          \ni sleep on the floor i cant find a mattress firm enough          \nI prefer my mattress firm but not rock hard either. The mattress I have now is about 14 years old and still very supporting to my back.  I once slept on a feather filled mattress when visiting my grandfather and woke up sore the next day.   Do they even make feather mattresses any more?          \nI so agree - there is nothing like slipping in to your own comfy bed. \r\n \r\nWe bought a new mattress in 2007, as I had been troubled with backache for many months.  What a difference.  No more backache since we got the new mattress. \r\n \r\nIt\'s a Millbrook 2000 Pocket Divine Mattress, which contains 2000 hand nested pocket springs that mould to the shape of your body.  (Quoting from the label I kept, ha ha ) \r\n \r\nIt\'s classed as medium/firm and is really so comfortable.          \nThe softer the mattress the better for me!!! \r\n \r\nMaybe because I am all soft and squishy myself!  LOL          \nfirm and changed about every ten years!          \nI prefer a medium to hard mattress now, however the best mattress I have ever slept in was when I was in the army, it was stuffed with that horrid horse hair type stuffing and it sagged in the middle but I used to snuggle down into it, it was so comfortable.          \nSelect Comfort, Sleep number solves all the problems! Excellent bed! \n \nYou can c chose to sleep on a hard firm surface, or dial it to the softness you need, The mattress never sags no fails to give uniform support regardless the setting!          \nA firm mattress.          \nMine is in between, or to put it another way there is a firm base, with a soft mattress on top          \nA firm mattress and a soft cotton mattress pad suits me. Mine is 17 yo and going strong. I can sleep standing up or on a hard floor so I\'m not picky.          \nI need a firm mattress for my back.  Have slept on one so long, I now cannot sleep on a soft mattress. \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nFirm.  Get a new one whenever it starts to get lumpy.          \nthe firmer the better.          \nI recently bought a new king bed , its just for me , so was silly really , and its one of those you do not turn the mattress over , ,just around , any way i sleep right to the edge of it , turned over in my sleep and fell out the bl**dy thing, i found it a little too hard , so bought a mattress topper ,HEAVEN , and i buy a new bed every 3 years ,          \nHard mattress every time. Anyone who has ever had back problems, and countless people have had slipped discs, for example, will all tell you, the harder the better. I know the doctors recommend it and when I got a slipped disc, way back in \'73, the doc. actually told me to sleep on the hard floor for a few days until the dic went back into place.          \nSoft. I have back problems and cannot lie on a hard surface without pain. I tried many mattresses but found a latex one from Englander that is good. If I had the money I would get Tempur-Pedic. I have had the latex mattress now for 10 years and it still feels like new.          \nFirm, due to back problems.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    After a few days away I was glad to return to my own bed. \r\n \r\nAlthough both hubby and I enjoyed our break both our backs suffered through using a much softer bed than we are used to. \r\n \r\nBoth our mattress and pillows are quite firm at home here and we did find that when we returned we were so pleased to be reacquainted with our comfy but firm old bed. \r\n \r\nSo what's your mattress like and how often to you change it for a new one?

	{'answer': u'\nSo is there a question somewhere or just another rant?          \nWell.... It\'s the anglicized version of "Yahweh," and "Yahweh," is supposedly the best guess at how the tetragrammaton "YHWH" was pronounced. But I agree with the scholars... Jehovah is a far cry from YHWH.          \nYeah... and...?  \r\n \r\nIt is a medieval misreading. I wouldn\'t trust what "the watchtower society people say when it comes to talking about the Lord. Be careful. They are misleading.  \r\n-They are a bit cookie if you ask me.          \nJehovah is how Christian,s hold to be God,s name,it is  \r\ndescribed in the Holy Bible as Jehovah God,so I will stay with that one.          \nThat is correct. We praise Him with the name jehovah and He is alright with it. The best part is that He comes to us in the name of Jesus Christ. Whatever we ask for is in the name of Jesus Christ. Miracles happen in the name of Jesus Christ. We are saved by being baptized ib the name of Jesus Christ. We receive the holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues in the name of Jesus Christ. The greatest name in heaven and earth is Jesus Christ!.There is only one name underheaven whereby we must be saved and that is jesus Christ!          \nI heard that the YHWH had accent marks that led people to misinterpret the letters and get "Jehovah" instead of "Yahweh" as the name of God. This is the only name the ancient Hebrews did, and I imagine still to this day, say as the name-His real name is forbidden to be spoken.          \nCCC 206 - In revealing his mysterious name, YHWH ("I AM HE WHO IS," "I AM WHO AM" or "I AM WHO I AM"), God says who he is and by what name he is to be called. This divine name is mysterious just as God is mystery. It is at once a name revealed and something like the refusal of a name, and hence it better expresses God as what he is\u2014infinitely above everything that we can understand or say: he is the "hidden God," his name is ineffable, and he is the God who makes himself close to men. \r\n \r\nCCC 207  - By revealing his name God at the same time reveals his faithfulness which is from everlasting to everlasting, valid for the past ("I am the God of your fathers"), as for the future ("I will be with you"). God, who reveals his name as "I AM," reveals himself as the God who is always there, present to his people in order to save them.          \nI have heard the name Jehovah is God\'s name translated in another language.          \nYHWH is Hebrew, Jehovah is the recognised English equivalent. I doubt any english words would appear in the earliest available texts. \r\n \r\nIf you apply this to Jehovah, then the same goes for Noah, Moses, Abraham, etc. but do scholars dispute those pronunciations? \r\n \r\n--------------- \r\n \r\nAlso, where are you getting your Watchtower Bible and Tract Society quotes from? Page 7 & 8? Of what?          \nIn Biblical times names HAD MEANING. Therefore, they were routinely TRANSLATED (both in scripture and in secular culture) rather than TRANSLITERATED - the latter being semi-represented by "Jehovah" as a rendering of the TETRAGRAMMATON. \r\n \r\nSee for instance, Kephas is an Aramaic TRANSLATION of the Greek name, Peter. Were we to actually TRANSLATE the name into English, the closest equivalent would be "Rocky." (Actually, such a rendering might give us a better indication of what Jesus saw in him that led to his renaming Simon as "Rocky" ... or Peter if you prefer.) \r\n \r\nThe name was used IN TRANSLATION some 28 times in the fourth Gospel. In each of these cases it is with reference to Jesus APPLYING THE NAME TO HIMSELF. However, there is no indication of the New Testament writers ever attempting to transliterate the name. In light of this, there is also no reason any modern Christian should attempt to use a MEANINGLESS TRANSLITERATION of the name.          \nNot all scholars say / believe that.  \r\n\'That\'..being what u said. \r\nI don\'t have to go look it up, bc TeeM already gave it up. \r\nI will add, that while it is true No one knows exactly  \r\nhow God\'s name YHWH is pronounced.  \r\nBc the Israelites stopped saying the name; \r\nout if their own superstition. \r\nThis alone, does not mean we (mankind) should not use  \r\nHis divine name.  \r\nHe had it included in the inspired Scriptures,  \r\nFOR US TO KNOW & USE. \r\nScholars have agreed on 2 spellings of the divine name. Yahweh & Jehovah. \r\nJehovah being more well known around the world. \r\nAnd in most Bibles @ Ps 83:18 & Ex 6:3, \r\nsome have footnotes regarding His divine name, \r\n@ these texts. \r\n \r\nedit:  \r\nLineDancer... \r\nGood! One!!!!!!!!!!! \r\nI vote B/A!          \nIf you are going to take issue with "Jehovah" being the accepted name of God in English, take a look at God\'s name in other languages: \r\n \r\nAwabakal - Yeh\xf3a \r\nBugotu - Jihova \r\nCantonese - Yehwowah \r\nDanish - Jehova \r\nDutch - Jehovah \r\nEfik - Jehovah \r\nEnglish - Jehovah \r\nFijian - Jiova \r\nFinnish - Jehova \r\nFrench - J\xe9hovah \r\nFutuna - Ihova \r\nGerman - Jehova \r\nHungarian - Jehova \r\nIgbo - Jehova \r\nItalian - Geova \r\nJapanese - Ehoba \r\nMaori - Ihowa \r\nMotu - Iehova \r\nMwala-Malu - Jihova \r\nNarrinyeri - Jehovah \r\nNembe - Jihova \r\nPetats - Jihouva \r\nPolish - Jehowa \r\nPortuguese - Jeov\xe1 \r\nRomanian - Iehova \r\nSamoan - Ieova \r\nSotho - Jehova \r\nSpanish - Jehov\xe1 \r\nSwahili - Yehova \r\nSwedish - Jehova \r\nTahitian - Iehova \r\nTagalog - Jehova \r\nTongan - Jihova \r\nVenda - Yehova \r\nXhosa - uYehova \r\nYoruba - Jehofah \r\nZulu - uJehova          \nYou are correct no one knows exactly how YHWH was pronounced.   Just as scholars say that it is not correct many say it is.  The argument will continue . \r\n \r\nThere were no written vowles in ancient Hebrew theu had to be added by the reader. \r\n \r\nJehovah just followes the convention of all other Hebrew names that start with J \r\n \r\nJob \r\nJerimiah \r\nJohnadab \r\nJoshua \r\nJakim \r\nJemimah \r\nJezabel \r\nJerusalem \r\n \r\netc \r\n \r\nSo the English form Jehovah has been accepted for many centuries, Yahweh would possibley be closer, but  then we would have to change all the Bibles with all the other J names would we not?  So Jehovah is the most widely accepted form in English, why change it/          \nThe word Jehovah has been created by adding the vowel signs for Adonai to YHWH. The first time the Tetragrammaton appeared in an English Bible was on the title page of William Tyndale\'s Bible translation of 1525, where it was written as Iehouah. This was an interlace of YHVH and Adonai. The King James Version also originally used Iehouah, influenced by the Ben Chayim codex. The King James Bible changed the spelling to Jehovah for the 1762-1769 edition.  \r\n \r\nRevised Standard Version pp.6-7 "The form Jehovah is of late medieval origin; it is a combination of the consonants of the Divine Name and the vowels attached to it by the Masoretes but belonging to an entirely different word. The sound of Y is represented by J and the sound of W by V, as in Latin. The word "Jehovah" does not accurately represent any form of the Name ever used in Hebrew."  \r\n \r\nIt is unfortunate, that the name was transliterated into German and ultimately into English as Jehovah, for this conflate form represents the vowels of Adonai superimposed on the consonants of Yahweh, and it was never intended by the Jews to be read as Yehowah (or Jehovah). The Jewish Encyclopaedia explains;  \r\n \r\n"A mispronunciation (introduced by Christian theologians, but almost entirely disregarded by the Jews) of the Hebrew "Yhwh," the (ineffable) name of God (the Tetragrammaton or "Shem ha-Meforash"). This pronunciation is grammatically impossible; it arose through pronouncing the vowels of the "?ere" (marginal reading of the Masorites: "Adonay") with the consonants of the "ketib" (text-reading: "Yhwh")"  (25/9/2005)  \r\n \r\nCombining YHWH with Adonai is referred to as interlacing, fusing or superimposing. It could hardly be considered accurate or respectful. The illogical fusion of the sacred Name with the vowel points of another name is shown in the preface to The J.B. Rotherham Emphasized Bible:  \r\n \r\n"To give the name JHVH the vowels of the word for Lord [Heb. Adonai], is about as hybrid a combination as it would be to spell the name Germany with the vowels in the name Portugal - viz., Gormuna. The monstrous combination Jehovah is not older than about 1520 A.D."          \nThe name "Jehova" comes from the three hebrew words, "Haya, Ho\'ve, Yihi\'ye" translated as " he was, he is, he will be"          \nYes and in some villages in Ethiopia the people had great difficulty pronouncing my name.  So they took to calling me "Anbessa LIb" (which they told me is "Lion\'s Heart and has great meaning here...."  Some how I always suspected it really meant "Look at fatso!" but I digress......).  So even though they didn\'t pronounce my name just right, both they and I knew who they meant.  I suppose God is at least as intelligent as me and the Ethiopian tribesmen.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    Yahweh was changed into Jehovah by Christians -- Mark 12:29  \r\n \r\nHarpers Bible Dictionary says that the name JEHOVAH was "the result of the translators\' ignorance of the Hebrew language and customs" (1985 edition , p. 1036)  \r\n \r\nThe Book "World Religions From Ancient History to the Present" says :  \r\n"The name Jehovah is a medieval misreading and does not occur in the Hebrew Bible" (edited by Geoffrey Parrinder, p. 386)  \r\n \r\nThe Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible says the name Jehovah is "an artificial name" (vol. 2, p.817)  \r\n \r\nAsimovs Guide to the Bible says that the name Jehovah "arose by mistake" (vol 1, p. 135). The author further says : "This mistake has persisted and will probably continue to persist" (p.135)  \r\n \r\nThe MOST famous name for God in the OT is called the Sacred Tetragrammaton \u2013It is YHWH.  \r\n \r\nJehovah is a mistaken name of YHWH. In fact nobody on the EARTH knows how to pronounce IT ! \r\n \r\n"When it came to God\'s name instead of putting the proper vowel signs around it, in most cases they put other vowel signs to remind the reader that he should say "Adonai". From this came the spelling Lehouah, and eventually Jehovah ...(pg. 8 ,Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, 1984)  \r\n \r\n"The truth is , nobody knows for sure how the name of God was originally pronounced". -(page 7- Watchtower Bible and Tract Soceity, 1984.)

	{'answer': u'\nColt in normal modern English is a sexually immature male horse (an immature mare is a filly). The Authorized translation (the King James version) is based ultimately on the 1525 translation by Tyndale and the translators deliberately sought to preserve Tyndale\'s language. He wrote in the language of his day "so that the Bible might be understanded by a plough boy", but English had changed so much by 1611 that Tyndale\'s language had by then acquired the impressive solemnity of antiquity, and their translation abounds with words and phrases that would have already seemed outdated to English speakers of Shakespeare\'s day  ("his" for "its", "yes" used only as the contradictory yes (the French "si"), "you" always replaced by "ye" in the nominative, etc. etc. The 1611 translators did not seek deception, only the respect for the word of God that they conceived would attend such solemnly old-fashioned language.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I am used to read the Bible in French. Sometimes when doubt i check in Hebraic version - the original language of the Bible. I checked some parts in Spanish and Chinese version: they are excellent translations. \r\nBut English version several times let me puzzled. For example tonight. \r\n \r\nSome weeks ago, i read in new testimony that before Easter (the Pessah), Jesus asked to his disciples to 'untie the colt'.  \r\nI was happy to learn - thank to the Bible - this new word: the colt was so, in old English, the baby of a she-donkey. \r\n \r\nThis episode about 'l'\xe2non le petit d'une anesse' is famous: according to the prophets (including Zachariah), the Messiah will come ' on a baby-donkey, the baby of a she-donkey'. \r\nMoreover we could take it as a sign of modesty; and the Torah, first part of the Bible was warning the future king 'not having to many horses' and 'not bringing them from Egypt'. \r\n \r\nTonight i look for' words in Harrap's shorter dictionary, to learn them in English. What a surprise! \r\n'Poulain' (baby of a horse) is 'colt' or 'foal' in English, and '\xe2non' (baby-donkey) is translated by 'young donkey or ***'. \r\n \r\nDid someone perverse enough to translate the Bible in order to make believe to simple-minded masses that the Messiah would ride a horse? (symbol of abusive power, like Pharaoh) \r\nOr did the words changed so quickly their meaning in English language? So that what was told 400 years ago has not the same meaning now? \r\n \r\nIn this last case, who - or what group - changed the meaning of English words?  \r\n(This is interesting for me because in french language there is a similar problem : some words have the same sounds, for example 'p\xe9cheur' sinner sounds like 'p\xeacheur' fisherman, or 'saint' holly sounds like 'sein' breast ; though Bible seems more ancient than actual french language, and the translator could have chosen less ambiguous synonyms)  ",

	{'answer': u'\nWhen I go out I eat exactly what I want to eat.  I don\'t count calories, fat grams, carbs, or anything else. \r\nI usually order spring rolls, crab cakes or coconut shrimp for starters. \r\nI like a good fresh salad with good hot rolls.  Any soft rolls but especially a good hot dark brown bread. \r\n \r\nIf I can get a good end cut of succulent prime ribs, then I am satisfied for meat. \r\n \r\nFor dessert, my wife and I usually share a slice of rich dark chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. \r\n \r\nDon\'t speak to me of diets, food is one of the last things we have left.          \nsorry lilly i never get to go to those kind of resteraunts my starter is pretty much the finish too          \nThe starter a nice soup!...          \nLOL it depends on what it is, and if I can even eat it! I have 30 pages of Food Allergies. I only eat out at a few restaurants because I don\'t like the stress of it all. But when I eat at Bertucci\'s, I usually save room for dessert. :)          \nthe starter for me , soup usually. don\'t eat much these days though, if we have fish & chips we share a portion !          \nThat is a lot of food right there \r\nOur restaurant give out free bread or roll before a meal  \r\nso what you mention is a no no because we would be full \r\nbefore the meal comes.          \nGimme desert every time !!          \nAlong with about 13 other addictions I ought not give details of, I\'ve always found SOUP irresistible - especially if accompanied with warm, fresh baked rolls, with lashings of butter. \nMain dish - my current state of health points me inevitably towards FISH - light tender flakes of sole, haddock or similar - with a few token veggie thingummies. Serious gastric problems have made me cut down on tartare sauce. \nIf a 3rd course is thrown in anyway - I\'ll opt for the cheese board, nibbling a few biscuits and "A nice piece of Wensleydale, Gromit". \nSo long as I have time to slip down a couple of large scotches AND pop outside for a ciggie AND settle the bill. \nIf raucous. restless grandchildren are in attendance, it can put me under a lot of pressure, believe me. \n; ))          \nProbably the dessert. \r\nI\'m stuck in the 70\'s,as my favourite meal is - \r\n \r\nPrawn cocktail. \r\nSteak au Poivre,garlic mushrooms,chips. \r\nBlack Forest gateau. \r\nIrish coffee,or similar.          \nCongratulations on your healthy eating habits.Mine is one course. I enjoy a soup or a plate of nibbling items such as nachos with a glass of wine.Being vegetarian I\'m careful as to what I eat and very conscious of the sodium content.          \nThe starter. A good salad is always nice.          \nIt is not just being old that did this for me...even when I was young and dating, I would still much prefer a starter course of soup (I LOVE homemade soups!) than a sweet afterwards.  \r\n \r\nI have been wracking my brain (a long process at this age) and can only think of 3 or 4 occasions in my whole LIFE where I opted for dessert!          \nI don\'t eat out very often.  When I do it is not a treat or a pleasure.  It happens only when necessary.  I really don\'t like having to eat anywhere except in my own home.   \r\n \r\nOn the occasions that I do have to get something to eat I prefer sitting on a park bench eating sandwiches but I will sometimes go to a fish and chip restaurant if it\'s too cold to sit outdoors. \r\n \r\nI have never, ever been to a dinner party nor have I ever given one.  I\'ve had visitors staying with us a few times so we\'ve had a full house but that is the sum of my catering history.  I have had 4 holidays in my entire life which have involved eating in a guest house or a hotel.  Other breaks have been self-catering. \r\n \r\nI\'m not very adventurous am I?          \nBeing diabetic I usually skip the appetizer and dessert so I don\'t over indulge myself.          \nMy preference is always for the starter.    Sweets are something I have no trouble passing up.   Like you,  I have a special fondness for pate....since it is something I don\'t make it home or eat very much of....if it is on the menu for a starter...that is what I go for.          \nI don\'t eat out often enough to have any preferences.It depends on the restaurant I guess.I\'ve never been to a restaurant that only offers one or the other.If offered, I would choose soup over salad most of the time and if I had a large meal I would usually skip dessert.          \ni like appetizers first,  not much on desert.  question..deserts and sweets seem to be a big treat in uk...true?  an elderly lady told me it was ages before they got things back after the depression, and thats why they are so special...true?          \nI go with the answer from Ritaah.  I am not that keen on eating out, not even in the homes of friends.Most people seem to find that odd, especially for a woman whom they think will jump at the chance of having a meal either made for them or maybe bought for them. \r\n \r\nI\'m a home bird and am just not comfortable anywhere else unless it\'s just for a cup of tea or coffee.          \nI went on a trip and cruise once, with a tour guide and a "bus" load of people.  Every place we went to eat, the food was prepared by gourmet chefs....the four to even five course type thing.  Quite "fancy".   \r\n \r\nOne night as we were seated reading the entrees, the lady sitting next to me said, "I\'ll have the frons." (SP?)  I said, "What\'s frons? \r\nShe said, "shrimp".  I looked her straight in the eyes and said, "Well, I declare.  I CAN be fancy and eloquent if I want to, but it ain\'t no fun!"  She laughed out loud and said, "I LIKE you!!!"  Both of us agreed that we couldn\'t wait to get back home (Texas, as you can probably surmised) and get a good ol\'  "greasy spoon" hamburger, and yes, fries with that please.          \nA 2-course meal here in the USA can mean an appetizer and entree; entree and dessert or appetizer and dessert. \r\n \r\nI prefer to go with the appetizer and entree          \nWhen we go to a restaurant we aren\'t able to eat a 3-course meal.  I have a sweet tooth so I always have a main meal then a dessert.  Usually I take ages making my mind up which dessert, as I like them all.          \nMeat potato rolls vegetable peach pie ala mode lots of strong coffee.          \nI love salads so would go for the starter. \r\nAs a type 11 diabetic, I have to take a pill 30 minutes before eating, & getting a starter helps me time it easier. If I wait too long I feel sick. \r\nA lot of entree\'s in the USA are way too large so I chose something that I can take the leftovers home, for the next day & usually a chicken dish that I don\'t cook at home.  \r\nWe don\'t eat out very often anymore because of the expense but it\'s lovely to have someone take away the dishes & we all deserve a treat now & again. \r\nI have a son-in-law who is a restaurant manager & was out of work for almost a year, during the recession. \r\nWhen you eat out, you\'re also helping the workers put food on their tables. Restaurants always like feedback & you have some interesting answers here for passing on.          \nIn my younger days it was all three but my appetite has diminished to the point that an entree is all I can manage and sometimes some of that goes home in a doggie bag.  But I love desserts and if there is a particular one that I fancy, I\'ll get that to go also.  Remainder of entree and the dessert make a lovely lunch the next day.          \nHi, Lily, I never order a dessert when I go out to eat because my meal is quite enough for me. If there\'s a salad I like it with my meal, not before. If we are at a buffet style place, I may get a small piece of dessert to eat with my meal, not after. Usually, at a buffet, the salad bar IS dessert to me.          \nMy husband and i had a restaurant we liked. Often we would each get the stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon with a delicious dipping sauce. That was on the appetizer menu. We\'d first have a Margarita. That would be our whole meal, four large shrimp. We would be quite satisfied. In that restaurant, if one ordered from the dinner menu as well, the amount of food  on the plate was overwhelming! \r\n \r\nHe and I would often at many restaurants order just one meal and maybe one appetizer and extra plates. We would both be full and there would still be food left!          \nStarter - half of my chocolate shake. \r\nMeal - chicken sandwich or cheesburger. \r\nDesert - remaining half of chocolate shake.          \ni could live on puddings with cream or custard poured on top          \nThe starter would be my preference. \r\nHomemade soup or broth until the warmer weather then it would be a prawn cocktail.          ',
	 'question': u"\n    the starter or the dessert when a two course meal is on offer? \r\n \r\nI prefer a starter probably a nice pate or goats cheese salad. \r\nHubby also like a starter, again pate or homemade soup. \r\n \r\nThe other 'younger' members of our family usually select something sweet and sticky from the dessert trolley. \r\n \r\nI find these days even when a three course meal is being offered Hubby and I are quite happy to hold back when the trolley comes around, mainly because we don't eat huge amounts anymore plus we try to avoid any extra calorie intake when and where we can. \r\n \r\nSo how about you, what would be your preference  the starter or dessert?

	{'answer': u'\nI think the Bible needs to be left alone, but I do love the name Jehovah. It just emphasizes who HE IS!!!!          \nIt is the JW\'s who changed the bible by adding their writings by Charles Russell to go along with the bible.  That is what the bible warned carried the curse.   \r\n \r\nGod knows those who are His no matter what name they choose to call him.          \nJehovah which is the English for the Hebrew YHWH is not the same word as Lord (Adonai) so it should not be changed.          \nI disagree with the sentiment of your argument. Christianity is concerned with suppressing the idea of "other" gods, and therein calling their god \'God\' or \'Lord\' is a superior idea because it better portrays their God as the only God. \r\n \r\nIn constrast, by using the name Jehovah, one would be specifying that said god, Jehovah, is superior to all other gods, which is, to some extent, a polytheistic outlook.          \nThe word LORD in capital letters means Jehovah. The KJV translators usually translated it like that, following the Jewish practice of not saying the name of God. \r\n \r\nHowever, the New Covenant name of God is Jesus. The Bible says Jesus is the only name whereby we must be saved. \r\n \r\nAct 4:12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.          \nThe New World Translation of the Bible is Jehovah\'s Witnesses own translation, no other religious group uses this Bible and Jehovah\'s Witnesses make very little use of other Bibles. \r\n \r\nThe translators of The New World Translation were: Nathan Knorr, Albert Schroeder, George Gangas, Fr          \nNo. The name Jehovah NEVER appeared in the Jewish bible. The sacred name of God was derived from the tetragramaton YHWH...Yahweh.... \r\nIn the 11th century, a Christian monk, confessor to the Pope, misunderstood a German notation, replacing "Y" with "J"...and setting the stage for the emergence of the false name Jehovah;....the mistake was picked up in the King James translation...and Joseph Rutherford...(who claimed to receive his Inspiration in a dream) choose to name his organization "Jehovah\'s Witnesses"....in a direct attempt to remove his group from any association with Charles Taze Russel\'s original \'CHRISTIAN Bible Students\' group. \r\n The Original "Jehovah\'s Witnesses" NEVER claimed to be anything other than a main-stream Christian group, even using the CROSS, within a crown, as a symbol on all of their earlier publications. It was only under the tutelage of the \'drunken and violent\' Joseph Rutherford that the Cross was replaced with the \'stake\' or \'stauros\' in Watchtower propaganda.          \nUnfortunately, JWs dont know who God & Jesus r so they cant b Christians (i.e. Heaven is 4 all true Christians & Hell is a real place - theres no 2nd chance). If the foundation was built upon sand so is the house no matter what u do 2 it. When the sand gives way both the foundation & all thats built upon it will collapse. The sea shall not discriminate & the storm with it shall b more ruthless than @ any other time in history. Nothing of human origin shall remain standing. \r\n \r\nHe who understands this shall look 2 build his house upon the foundation that stands 4ever upon the Rock that shall never b moved. He who has ears let him hear what is, has been & always will b 4ever the same. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those moving in later? \r\n \r\nThe NWT bible is slanted 2 support their religion (& the Watchtower bks). Its worse than a mistranslation b/c @ least some of it was deliberately tailored 2 fit the JW\'s false gospel. Most JWs will see it as being the true Gospel having not understood without Jesus they cant see the truth (also, false prophecies like the 1914 1 cancel out any JW\'s claimed so-called truth - they dont hv a clue & they\'ll just keep saying thats not exactly what we meant like the serpant did with Eve). \r\n \r\nJWs r really good @ gathering all kinds of info about God, Jesus & the Bible. Unfortunately, they & other religions/churches have taken an academic approach 2 understanding whats in the Bible. The problem is that they didnt come 2 understand the difference btwn gaining knowledge & a real relationship with God & Jesus Christ. \r\n \r\nFrom there the JWs, like most Catholics, Mormons, many Protestants, Islam, moonies, Buddhists, Hinduism, Christian Scientists, Scientology & others, having begun in error, began adding on more & more error as they got even further away from God\'s actual truth. Neither a label, title, name, its history, the amount of time it existed or claims about them means anything. Its the substance/actions behind them that makes it legitimate or a lie (calling a dog God doesnt make it so - getting hung up on a name among several 4 God (in the Bible) keeps people from finding the real Jesus). U can name anything anything (i.e. Calling something Christian doesnt make it so - Mt 7:21-23). A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God\'s full definition or usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). \r\n \r\nRegrettably, many dont actually take seriously whats stated in the Bible. They think/act as if they r smarter than God. But God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant b properly understood without going thru Jesus Christ (Jn 14:6; 5:39; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish people cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant, including the JWs. Its why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division). \r\n \r\nIts why theres many religions who made fatal mistakes as they built them on what man wants God 2 be like. I realized they cant all be right (Theres 1 Bible - why so many interpretations? II Pet 1:**19-21). Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they don\'t know). But it doesnt mean God doesnt know what He\'s doing. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those who move in later? \r\n \r\nThe main point missed (including JWs) is Jesus Christ is the only 1 in history whom stated that He\'s "the" way, "the" truth & "the" life & no 1 gets 2 God except by Him (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12) & is the only 1 whom came from God. Its fully true or theres no truth & cant be any God (He knows what He\'s doing or He\' cant be God). \r\n \r\nSince Jesus is the only way 2 know God, it means "the" whole truth was complete & finished thru Jesus\' teaching. This means any claimed new teaching & any other religious beliefs or from self-proclaimed prophets & teachers r null & void & cant lead u 2 our real God. God always knew all Jesus was 2 speak & do & all the dumb things man would do, including teaching false gospels. \r\n \r\nJesus couldntve done nor said all He did unless He had full knowledge of the entire OT (the NT didnt exist in Jesus\' time - the only way Jesus could\'ve known the whole OT is if God\'s with Him) & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus made them know & remember His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Not possible unless God caused it. \r\n \r\nJW\'s teachings r so out of sync with Jesus\' actual teachings theres no way 2 patch the errors even with borrowed "truths". My advice is 2 get out while u can - the more u allow their teachings 2 program u the greater your chance of never finding our real Jesus Christ & u should warn others. Rewriting Bible passages & labelling it a new world translation doesnt make it any more true - reducing Jesus 2 "a" son of God cancels out the rest of JW\'s teachings or from other religions doing the same. Jesus rose from the dead physically not just Spiritually & no earthly religious organization is infallible only the truth that stands 4ever unchanged. \r\n \r\nBut whoever seeks Jesus with all his heart & soul will find God\'s Kingdom (u shall know the truth & it shall make u free). Why should God want 1 living with Him forever that doesnt want 2 know Him (reason 4 free will - Jn 1:12-13)? God\'s truth remains forever unchanged while religions & gods created in mans image dies with him (no religions can save u). \r\n \r\nOn 1 hand, God hates us b/c of our sins - neither being a good person as judged by men or religion can save u. On the other hand, God loves us dearly enough 2 send His Son 2 die for our sins - so that thru Jesus our sins could b forgiven if we sincerely turn 2 Him - Theres everlasting hope only in Jesus Christ & His Bible. \r\n \r\nvoyc4rmwldrns          \nI would say yes if it was REALLY removed from the Greek and IF Jehovah was the True Name of Almighty God. \r\n \r\nApparently the Divine Name was never in the Greek, so it has no place there. If God wanted it there it would have been there.  Jehovah is also an abominable translation of the I AM/YHWH. \r\n \r\nMy take on this from my blog is pasted in below: \r\n \r\nThere are no vowels in the Tetragrammaton, so we have no idea how to pronounce it. It could be Yaweh, Yahwah, YoYo, or even Yippee for all we know. Here is some interesting info: \r\n \r\nDr. J. B. Rotherham states in the preface of his Bible concerning Jehovah: "Erroneously written and pronounced Jehovah, which is merely a combination of the sacred Tetragrammaton and the vowels in the Hebrew word for Lord, substituted by the Jews for JHVH, because they shrank from pronouncing The Name, owing to an old misconception of the two passages, Ex. 20:7 and Lev. 24:16...To give the name JHVH the vowels of the word for Lord [Heb. Adonai], is about as hybrid a combination as it would be to spell the name Germany with the vowels in the name Portugal - viz., Gormuna. The monstrous combination Jehovah is not older than about 1520 A.D." (Truthseek.net) \r\n \r\nJehovah\'s Witnesses say it is important to use Jehovah and to vindicate His Holy Name. But are they accurate in using Jehovah? No, they even admit it on pages 16 and 18 of the book "Let Your Name Be sanctified" they admit that Yahweh is the superior translation of YHWH. \r\n \r\nIn the preface of their own "Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures" page 23 shares this admission with the reader: \r\n"While inclining to view the pronunciation \'Yahweh\' as the more correct way, we have retained the form \'Jehovah\' because of people\'s familiarity with it since the 14th century. Moreover, it preserves equally with other forms, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton JHVH."  \r\n \r\nIn other words, they know they have God\'s Name all wrong, but they are not going to change because people are more familiar with the WRONG NAME? \r\n \r\nThey are VINDICATING an incorrect name because people are familiar with it? What sort of Vindicating is this?          \nNo. \r\n \r\nThe texts do not use YHVH or any Greek version of YHVH. \r\n \r\nGreat answers by "question it all" , rev kip , and egyphile. \r\n \r\nThe Watchtower admits to knowing \'\'jehovah\'\' is wrong and even the orginating demonic source and yet continues to use the Gehenna bound trash. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nJehovah is a very bad transliteration of God\'s Holy name. \r\n \r\nRamon Marti polluted the name of God. Ram\xf3n Mart\xed was a heretical monk of the Dominican order is the first recorded person using "Jehovah". Ramon Marti was assigned the job to remove the passages from Hebrew and Greek manuscripts offensive to the "Christian" religion. Censorship at it worse to say the least. \r\n \r\nIn English it can clearly be seen \'\'jehovah\'\' is most definitely of the liar and serpent. \r\nJeh- \r\nIn some dialects "jeh" means "jinn" which is an evil spirit. \'Jeh\' is also \'the whore\'. In Persian mythology. She is responsible for the death of the first man. Jeh is also used for a consort, paid or unpaid, outside of the marriage bond. \r\n \r\nHovah- \r\nStrong\'s #1943 Hovah, another form for 1942; RUIN:-MISCHIEF "Mischief" as is meant means "bad intentions" or "of evil intent". \r\n \r\n\'Jehovah\' can be broken down into the \'whore of mischief\' or \' demon of ruin\' in Hebrew and Babylonian words.  \r\n \r\nLook up \u201cjeh\u201d or \u201cjah\u201d and look \u201chovah\u201d in Hebrew use a  Strong\u2019s Concordance. Do this for yourself and remember what you find every time you speak or teach or pray.  \r\n \r\nGod\'s name: \r\nExodus 3: \r\n14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. \r\n \r\nI AM that I AM \r\nHebrew- (\u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4,) pronounced ehyah asher Ehyah \r\n \r\nIn English YHWH is given modern definition JHVH and eoa from Elohim /Adonai. \r\nbad - very bad transliteration/translation via letter transposition. \r\n \r\nNote the last part of the above verse in Exodus 3:14 \r\n...Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. \r\nI Am is God\'s name. \r\nThis is E\'yah pronounced eYah - a drawn Y in pronounciation or just Yah. Yah is God\'s name - not Jah - not Jehovah. \r\n \r\nThis is straight from the Hebrew. God\'s name is E\'yah in all languages - do not be fooled by confusing arguments in this area because there are many convoluted, complex, manipulating, and justifying arguments. \r\nMany say Yah mean \u201cexistent one\u201d or \u201ccauses to exist\u201d. \r\nThat is error. \r\nE\u2019Yah means \u201cI AM\u201d.  <note the period! \r\n \r\nGod\'s sacred name is very simple to find and know. I am surprised that so many bible students over the years can not see this but the dark does not comprehend light. (John 1:4&5) \r\n \r\nIn Matthew 6:9 Jesus said; \u201cOur FATHER who art in heaven HOLY is your name Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .Give us this day our daily bread and deliver us from evil. \r\n \r\nJesus  used Abba and Father. So should we Christians use these? Absolutely.          \nWe as Christians know that Lord is Jehovah, but WTS has its own agenda. \r\n \r\nYES, indeed, Thomas would have called Jesus as Jehovah!!          \nNO !          ',

	{'answer': u'\nI have faith that my children will be successfull and healthy.  I trust them to make the right decisions in life.  I will not give them my PIN of my ATM card.          \nFaith is more to God or something abstract (like fate), while trust is more to human.          \ntrust is based on what you know \r\nfaith is based on what you dont          \nTo me, faith is belief in something without evidence, and sometimes belief in something contrary to the evidence. (such as believing your spouse will not cheat on you again, after they have already done so repeatedly) \r\n \r\nTrust is belief with evidence, something that is earned or demonstrated. (such as believing that your spouse will not cheat on you because they haven\'t ever done so in any of their relationships)          \nIn faith there is conscious doubt; in trust their is subconscious doubt.          \nFaith is believing God. Trust is a more general term and can be between people and/or God.          \nFaith is belief which is the most important to enter heaven. \r\n \r\nTrust is something that really shouldn\'t be done with humans, but God can always be trusted.          \nTo me faith is complete trust in the unknown, and trust is complete faith in what is known.          \nI only trust my dog. \r\n \r\nI have faith in God. \r\n \r\nGod-Dog-God-DOG          \nIf a person has proven themselves trustworthy, I am able to trust them. \r\n \r\nFaith is belief without evidence.  Trust and faith are two different things entirely.          \nI take three different meanings of \'faith\' depending on context. \r\n \r\n1. Absolute belief of some claim as being certain. \r\n \r\n2. Belief (certain or not) of a claim without any basis in evidence. \r\n \r\n3. Confidence in something recognised as uncertain. \r\n \r\nAll three rely on trust, but are not synonymous with trust. \r\n \r\nTrust is about accepting the source of a claim as being reliably correct.          \nlets see, your a tricky bugger arnt you..a deep thinker. I\'d say they are 2 differnt things. Lets see if I can form this into words that are swirling around in my brain. Trust....is something earned. I trust my spouse would never hit me..because he has never laid his hands on me in that way. I trust that my truck will start because it always has. \r\nFaith on the other hand is not earned. Faith is believeing in something that you have no way to prove. Faith is not based on past experience, or a surity of anything. Faith is emotional, a verb I suppose, where as Trust is more of a noun. I trust God, cause he has helped me through things in my life, But i have Faith because at times when I  can feel Him. That make any sense?          \nMy opinion:  \r\n \r\n"Faith" is a hope that things will turn-out okay in any particular situation or personal relationship.  \r\n \r\n"Trust" is a term we sometimes use to convince ourselves that our "faith" is justified. \r\n \r\nEdit: I would personally rather use the guideline of "workability".          \nThey both mean the same thing..          \nhey (((jon))), well, to me, they are almost the same but not quite, both comprise hope and both can be rooted in intuition. however, the trust i have in a loved one tends to be based on a knowledge of prior behaviour and general attitude,  in knowledge - i will have developed a sense of who they are, to what extent they can be relied or counted upon. even upon first meeting someone we will already be working out (through various means, such as non-verbal communication - reading of body language and decoding of micro-expressions- subconsciously analysing the tones and cadences of their speech and so on) whether we can or not trust him or her, whether the other person means us well or not (regardless of whether we sometimes get it wrong).  \r\n \r\nthe difference for me between the two concepts, between faith/trust in God and faith/trust in a person lies in the space between us, in what happens in that space, in the physical dimension (one which includes the biological and/or chemical aspects of human interaction). not the most spiritual of responses, i know... i have a feeling this is one of those deceptively simple questions and that the answer i have given you is going to nag me for the rest of the day, i\'ll warn you now, i may feel compelled to return and edit (though i promise i shall try to exercise some restraint, lol!). \r\n \r\nhey (((michael))), what a lovely answer :)          \nTo me, Trust is a word that you use when your confidence is low.  Whether you are depressed or confused or doubtful about several things all at the same time.  For the Bible says to have trust in Him. \r\n \r\nTrust is also like Respect in that you (build up) trust by "seeing" someone DO what they said they would do.  Trust is what we need in the Lord to Claim His promises.  We need to trust in ever bigger promises as we grow up as a Christian. \r\n \r\nFaith was first used in the Bible in conjunction with our faith in God to Save us based Solely on the Sacrifice that Jesus made.  Revelation 2:13, 19, 13:10, and 14:12 all use words saying (patients and faith of the saints).  Deuteronomy 32:20  has the first usage of this word and it pertains to The Salvation of those....who posses faith.  And the Second usage of Faith in the O.T. is Hab. 2:14 also talks about living by faith as it pertains to being saved. \r\n \r\nFaith\'s primary meaning is to believe that Jesus\' Sacrifice atones for your and my sins.          \nSame for me. \r\n \r\nBoth "faith" and "trust" are relationally based: \r\nPerson-to-Person - within the Godhead; Father-Son-Holy Spirit \r\nPerson(s)-to-person(s) - God to human/humans/humanity \r\nperson(s)-to-person(s) - human(s) to human(s) \r\n \r\nEDIT: \r\nGiven some of the answers here, I wanted to clarify what faith means for me.   \r\n \r\n"Faith" for me is not really me-centred, but God-centred - Christ the Incarnate Son\'s faith and trust in the Father, by the mediation of the Holy Spirit is given to us by the Holy Spirit;  God shares His faith and trust in Himself (the Person-to-Person thingy, above) with humanity.  i.e., God gives us Christ\'s faith when He gives us the Holy Spirit; so we are no left to ourselves when it comes to facing death, but we face death with "Christ in us, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1.27)....          \nTrust is developed slowly but can be destroyed in an instant. With so many sensing that their trust has been abused, is it any wonder that people are reluctant to have confidence in others? According to a survey published in Germany in 2002, \u201cfewer than 1 in 3 youths have a basic trust in other people.\u201d \r\nFaith- primarily conveying the thought of confidence, trust, firm persuasion. Depending on the context, the Greek word may also be understood to mean \u201cfaithfulness\u201d or \u201cfidelity.\u201d\u20141Th 3:7; Tit 2:10. \r\nFaith is based on concrete evidence. The visible creative works testify to the existence of an invisible Creator. (Ro 1:20) The actual occurrences taking place during the ministry and earthly life of Jesus Christ identify him as the Son of God. (Mt 27:54;  \r\n\u201cTrust not to rotten planks,\u201d wrote English dramatist William Shakespeare. Indeed, before stepping onto the wooden planks of a boat, you would want to be sure that the wood was not rotten. \r\nTHE words of Shakespeare echo the sentiments of wise King Solomon of ancient Israel, who some 3,000 years ago wrote: \u201cA fool will believe anything; smart people watch their step.\u201d (Proverbs 14:15, Today\u2019s English Version) Yes, only a fool would go through life blindly accepting everything he hears, basing his decisions and actions on frivolous advice or baseless teachings. Misplacing our trust\u2014like stepping onto rotten planks\u2014can lead to disaster.          \nhi Jon: \r\n \r\nYou\'ve already gotten some really good answers.  I\'ll throw in my two cents\' worth for what it\'s worth. The terms are overlapping.  I happen to live near the source of the Mississippi, so I\'ll use a river as my point of reference.  Faith is what an eagle sees when she looks down on the water; trust what a fish sees from within it.  Both perspectives are "true".  Wisdom, at least for me, is understanding that the air and water are not separate, but parts of a living system that transform into one another over time.   \r\n \r\nhave a great day.          \nBlessings to all. Faith is hope in trust . It means you are hoping to see your faith come  alive  it\'s the substances of things  hoped  for, the evidence of things not seen  . Faith and trust always work together for   good they both means the same thing.          \nMy perception of faith and trust is this: \r\n \r\nTrust is vital in the foundation of any human relationship. There can be no harmony,  no positive energy flowing between two people without it.  Trust is the balance kept. \r\n \r\nFaith is infinite security, above and beyond this life, in this world.  It is \'the relationship\' one must seek with The One, to find freedom from self, rest and peace, and their way back home...  :D \r\n \r\nPeace and Blessings \r\n(((((JON)))))          \nBetween G=d and people: \r\nFaith is about my belief in G-d and all the beliefs connected to Him  (my family and friends, my community, parish, Y/A, etc). Just believing in G-d won\'t save me if I have no trust in G-d. Even the Devil believes in G-d! I don\'t think he\'ll end up in Heaven! ;-)) \r\n \r\nTrust is more complex to define. It goes deeper than faith alone. Maybe that\'s why J\'esus asks us to trust in Him (Divine Mercy). It\'s having confidence in him, or letting the reign of our life to Him. It\'s yielding ourselves or our free will to Him, to His leadership. It\'s very difficult for humans to accomplish as we must totally trust the loyalty and faithfulness of G-d to do so. One must know and love G-d very much to do that. It\'s to  learn to let go and to let G-d instead ;-) \r\n \r\nBetween parents and children/ between spouses/ family members: \r\nFaith: it\'s believing that one person can achieve great things in life. \r\n \r\nTrust: I think it has to do do with the truthfulness in people/ You can trust someone with your secrets for instance if they are trustworthy. You can trust your spouse with your marital vows because you know that person very well and trust that s/he has goodness for you in his/her heart. S/he will not betray you.  \r\n \r\nIn conclusion, Trust is more radical and deeper than Faith as it engages or involves you too. It\'s very intimate and compels you to put your trust into someone else. Let\'s hope that after trusting somebody we will not be betrayed! There\'s nothing more painful than to be betrayed by those you love!          \nfaith and trust. faith is what you give to a person you met off the street... until he proves other wise there\'s no reason to not have faith if someone says they will do something. now trust must be earned. if my neighbor says he will run to the store for me ill believe him. but i wont give him my bank card.. now my best friend i have trust in. he has earned it and i would trust giving him my card and pin.. for trust to work you must have faith. you must have faith in god before you can trust him. you have faith he exists in your day to day life then you will start to build a trust with him over time.          \nIf you are going to understand God, God\'s terminology you will have to learn from the bible not a mans Dictionary. \r\n"For my ways and my thoughts are not your ways and your thoughts, and as heaven is above the earth, so are my ways and my thoughts above yours. \r\n \r\nExample: When you want to remove a tree from , lets say the front yard; what do you do? \r\nWhat do men do if they want to remove a tree? You will find them going to the tool shed, for a shovel and pick, or if you have money you will pay someone else ad find him with a shovel and pick. \r\n \r\n"BUT" Christ shows up and say: "If you had faith as a mustered seed, you might say to this sycamore tree, be uprooted and be planted by the sea, and it shall obey you" Luke 17: 6 \r\n \r\nWhose faith is this believing based upon, mans or the spoken word of God? What man do you know today that at removing a tree will speak to the tree and tell it to be removed? \r\n \r\nGod way and God\'s thought, Right" The shovel and pick , mans way and mans thought right? \r\n \r\nHow many women who are ninety years old seek to get pregnant?  \r\nDo men get the idea that dead people can be raised from the dead?  \r\nWho do you know that walks on water? \r\nWho do you know who speaks to the raging water and boisterous wind to be calm? \r\nA person may have faith to swim to Catalina Island from huntington beach. \r\n \r\nA person might believe to climb the highest mountain peak, but they are within mans scope \r\n \r\nFaith is based upon the ability one has to fulfill the thing believed for. \r\n \r\nIf it is mans faith , then it is based upon his ability to do the thing believed for. \r\n \r\nTrust is believing. \r\n \r\nPutting your trust in God, will require you to believe God, and believing God is God speaking words and you hearing His word and you believing Him at His Word, is trusting Him to do what is impossible with men          \nTrust is based on repeatable performances. \r\n \r\nFaith requires no evidence/proof to happen.          \nI have faith in my abilities and trust my own thinking. \r\n \r\nRScott          \nI see them slightly different but feel it may almost be semantics. \r\nSeems in my Spiritual life the mean the same.  \r\nFaith is not hope to me, hope is hope. \r\nFaith is that I know all is working toward my coming to Remembrance no matter what my Human assessments may be or what it feels like. \r\nIn my Human relationships, I can have a relationship where my "trust" has been broken, & still ultimately have faith in that person knowing within they are the same as me. \r\nTrust very often is a judgment based on past experience, theirs & mine. \r\nFaith goes much deeper, it has nothing to do with the intellect but comes from the Wisdom of the Heart. \r\nA simple gift given to another, "I have complete faith in you" will very often help to release the bonds of past mistakes. \r\nI feel I may not have explained this well, the difference is subtle. \r\nBut this was a great Q! \r\nYou had me pondering this for 2 days. \r\nMany Blessings!          \nI think trust is built by faith/belief.  Theists trust God because they have faith in him.  I can trust my my paycheck will be go through because it has never failed to do so.   \r\n \r\nTrust to me is earned.  For me it\'s by reason and evidence, not faith.          \nFaith comes from the heart...trust comes from the mind. \r\n \r\nIn my own experience, faith requires no context, no history, nothing that must be known...it stands alone, unrelated to anything else.  Trust, on the other hand, arises from past experience with something or someone in which a context holds information to base the trust upon.   \r\n \r\nFaith is immeasurable, wholly connected and unified, based on nothing (no thing).  Trust is a measurement, a weighing, a judgment based on evidence.  With faith there is no comparison, while trust is solely derived from comparative evidence.  This, of course, is my own understanding. \r\n \r\ni am Sirius          ',

	{'answer': u"\nnever heard of that, but check w/ the embassy in china          \nRubbish! \r\n \r\nBesides who in their right mind would give up a green card in exchange for a 5 year multi-entry visa anyway? \r\n \r\nComplete trash.          \nPeople who voluntarily surrender their green cards and execute form I-407 are probably the most bona fide nonimmigrants on the planet. If a person no longer wants to live in the U.S., that person is probably the most legitimate visitor out of a thousand visitors. \r\n \r\nWhen border officers discover that a green card holder no longer lives in the U.S., they offer the person two choices:  \r\n1. Present the case to an Immigration Judge; \r\n2. Surrender the card and enter as a visitor (or whatever status they seek).  \r\n \r\nNormally, the person won't have a visitors visa, but the border officers will happily waive the visa requirement in exchange for the surrender of the green card. \r\n \r\nI believe that the site posting that you referred to is 100% authentic. You can safely turn in the card to a visa officer at the U.S. consulate or embassy, but not to anyone else in China.          \nyou'd better check it out at uscis.gov \r\n \r\nI can think of all sorts of reasons some scam site would want you to give them a legitimate green card, none of them good. \r\n \r\n- \r\nFred, above, is probably right, but I would still do it through an official site.  Just because the program legitimately exists doesn't mean the agent you are using is legitimate.          \nThis is officially legitimate.  Permanent residents must physically be in US at least 6 months a year, and a lot of people cannot do that.  So this is the option for those who wish to come and go but not live in US permanently. \r\n \r\nYou surender greencard and receive multiple entry tourist visa for 5 years or 10 years depending on what country you're in.

	{'answer': u"\nNothing you can do          \nWell, the fact that they surrendered their Green Card puts them right back in the same category as any other Indian citizen who would like to apply for a Visa.  It's up the American Consulate to grant or deny to any person a visa.   Your parents must prove to the American Government that they would qualify for a b1/b2 visa.  If they got denied, perhaps they were unable to prove that they were economically solvent in India so that they wouldn't overstay their visa in the USA and work illegally.   Just because they were denied doesn't mean that they were eternally banned from coming to the USA.   THey could try again in 6 months (or whenever the time period expires for them to try again.....usually it's 6 months...for most countries)  They should've become US CItizens so that this would've never happened.          \nthe green card is for someone to live and work in the u.s. permanently. from what you say your parents did not want to live and work in the u.s. so they were considered to have abandoned their status. if they would have approached the American Consulate in India and stated they had green cards but did not want to  live and work in the u.s. then the consulate would probably have let them surrender their green card in exchange for a tourist visa.  but now all you can do is start all over again with the green card process.

	{'answer': u'\nwe are 69 and 77, like you we have cut down on eating, we find as we get older we don\'t have the exercise anymore, we are both disabled so we have to watch our weight, and budget,it is a case of eat or freeze, have one slice of bread in the morning and a light lunch and just a cup of tea in the evening, if we are really hungry we might have a biscuit  as well.          \nyes          \nI try eating a healthy breakfast;not heavy consisting of a banana,wheat toast,oatmeal and green tea. \r\nOn the days I\'m with our rescue group for lunch I get a pastry and coffee on the way over to the pet store. \r\nDinner consists of a soup or beans.I have gotten in the habit of consistent eating habits.          \nI eat only when I\'m hungry now that I\'m home most of the time.  My husband still works and is a 3-meal a day addict (with a few cookies in between.)          \nMorning me: coffee, bagel, or biscuits, or toast. Hubby, only coffee. \n \n@ noon: could be, minestrone, spaghetti, Risotto, vegetables, beans, green beans, potatoes, or eggs and, or omelet, with asparagus, or zucchini. \n \nEvening: sometime we have left  over, or some kind of meat, "not very fun of meat" or we have fish sometime, or salad, broccoli, or roasted green peppers with lots of garlic.  \n \nOOps: we eat lots of fruits, any kind of fruits every day.          \nMy family was lucky to eat one meal together, so dinner was the only special meal. \r\n \r\nUsually I eat two, breakfast and supper and nibble in the afternoon.  When taking pills 3 times a day, I eat 3 meals.          \nI used to have a routine, but now that I\'m alone I generally have to be prompted to eat. I don\'t enjoy eating alone particularly. I dunno why, but it seems to make mealtime more of a chore than the shared enjoyment that it used to be. I find that cooking it myself often puts me off of eating it too. Mind you,I\'m not a great cook ha ha ( understatement of the year). Someone Els cooking me a meal is a complete joy. I agree, you don\'t need anywhere near as much food when you retire.          \nI am not very hungry in the mornings but do eat because I know I should, something lite usually like some bread and cheese.One egg once or twice a week or small bowl of corn flakes. \r\nWe eat our largest meal in the early afternoon and in the evening maybe some fruit salad or some deserts. \r\nI will snack on a portion of leftovers if I get hungry before our main meal but doesn\'t happen that often. \r\nI do at least 90 min. of fast moving yoga every morning and sometimes feel hungry after I am done. \r\nOne thing about moving to eastern Europe, the foods may not be as varied as we have in the US but everyhting really is fresh and tastes so good. Food is less then half the cost as in the US too. \r\nI have been doing allot of walking in the past few months and lost 6 lbs. without even trying to. I don\'t need to lose any weight so I may start eating something before bedtime, a few hours before at least.My husband as gained about 5 lbs. since we moved here.He loves his cakes.          \nMy husband has a cooked breakfast most days,I can,t face food first thing in the morning,so I have a sandwich or a couple of boiled eggs at lunchtime while he has a scone or something light.We have a proper dinner around 5-0 pm ,beef casserole,sausages and mash,belly of pork with roast vegetables e.t.c.,.e.t.c.So really it amounts to 2 meals a day Plus little extras when fancied.!          \nWe eat when we feel like eating and not always three meals a day          \nI do have three main meals a day.  The times are flexible, usually within a two hour window, mostly guided by hunger pangs which do seem to strike fairly regularly.  I also have three snacks. \r\n \r\nI don\'t think my eating habits have changed much over the years, just the quantity - as you say, smaller portions.   \r\n \r\nSo it is breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus mid morning, mid afternoon and mid evening snacks. \r\n \r\nm          \nwe keep to regular three meals for mom she\'s skinny. sometimes we go with two or if a potluck or buffet meal, that\'ll do the trick for all day.          \nI usually eat around the same time each day. \r\nBrekkie - 7:30 \r\nDinner - 12:30 \r\nTea - 5:00 \r\n \r\nDinnertime is usually something light,soup or sphagetti on toast or similar \r\nMain meal is tea time          \nIt\'s more like one continuous grazing if you know what I mean.  :)          \nHi, Lily. We eat our one substantial meal in the late afternoons, and nibble the rest of the day. Hardly ever eat in the evenings. I have taken lately to munch on a piece of toast in the mornings before I take my fish oil capsule and vitamins as otherwise they make me a little nauseous. During the day I\'m happy if I have an apple or a veggie to nibble. Yum. I was brought up on three meals a day, but never adhered to it as an adult.          \nI only eat when I\'m hungry and not as soon as it occurs. Over eating stretches the stomach and causes one to feel hungry sooner. \r\nI eat a multi vitamin for breakfast. My first meal is usually mid to late afternoon. Then, I eat before bed as this makes me sleepy. I eat twice a day and I feel very healthy at my "fighting weight". Weight control is about burning the caloric intake. If one wants to eat a lot they need more exercise.          \nGood breakfast.A drink and a biscuit for lunch and a cooked meal about 6pm.          \nI have Diabetes II, and therefore have to regularly, but must admit I sometimes miss one of those meals. TRY to also get in breakfast and my evening meal and maybe just some soup at lunch time.          \nSometimes more than 3, I eat almost whatever and whenever it is served to me. Official diet to start right after my birthday.          \nI eat when I am hungry. \r\n \r\nNot EVER when I first wake up--my usual "brunch" time is between 10 a.m. and noon, and I usually have a bowl of soup then that I have put together from pkged broth and vegetables and a bit of pasta. If I am feeling particularly hungry I will throw in some leftover meat or some shrimps. \r\n \r\nThen it is supper at around 6 p.m. and that is it for the day.  \r\n \r\nI am not a big snacker, either--don\'t tend to eat much between meals, unless I have missed a meal and then I will have a little something to tide me over.  \r\n \r\nI don\'t ever eat anything beyond 8 p.m. at night because I don\'t want to go to bed with a full stomach. It is totally uncomfortable for me to do so--usually causes acid reflux if nothing else!          \nI usually just have brunch now and a main meal around 5 - 6 PM.  Cannot manage to eat nearly as much as I did when i was young. \r\n \r\nBeulah          \nNo, there\'s no real routine here. With hubby working part-time, we don\'t always have daily meal times.  \r\n \r\nPlus, I\'m not as good as many people here about sticking to a regimen for myself. I still tend to grab whatever happens to be there....and unfortunately that "need to eat less now that I\'m older" still hasn\'t hit. (We went to the Asian Buffet for our New Years dinner....and I was doomed the moment we walked in the door, lol!)          \nThe way you described your and Mr Lily\'s (smile) eating habits just about covered the way we eat here. Not so much of a "plan" anymore. It\'s kind of a grab what you can when you can. Somewhere recently, I read the greatest li\'l proposal for those enjoying the later years... it said one of the greatest joys of aging is getting rid of that urge to look at a clock when someone asks you if you\'re hungry. It\'s a terrible habit. I still do it sometimes... my husband does... but now we both look at each other and crack up when we do it. "You about ready for some lunch?" and the partner looks at the clock to determine if they\'re hungry. hahaha.... it\'s almost reflexive! \r\nBut yes... smaller amounts and sometimes even more than three times per day. It seems to work for us.          \nMost days, but sometimes I skip lunch.          \nWhen I am visiting friends, we eat 3 a day. When I am home, sometimes 2 or even one. If I am busy I sometimes forget to eat. Sometimes I like a quick snack. But I like the bigger meal to be breakfast.          \nTwo very small and one medium.

	{'answer': u'\nsex is where a man\'s penis penetrates a woman\'s vagina.          \nnice job putting FISHY in the same paragraph as SEX.  Awesome image there.          \nthere are endorphins released after sex that relax you.          \nPhil Collins answer is correct but there must be consent - otherwise it\'s rape.          \nNature\'s Own: The Feel Good Hormone  \r\nBy: Nicole Stevenson    \r\n Serendip.com \r\nSex feels good, that is why people do it for more than simply procreation. Laughing is enjoyable, for that reason people search for things that amuse them. Touch is pleasing, therefore the massage business thrives. These things can become addictive due to the pleasurable effect that they produce. People have been exercising obsessively for a long time but only recently was an idea postulated as an explanation. Laughter often begets laughter and in large doses, has the ability to make one feel high. We do what makes us feel good; human beings are naturally pleasure seekers. It is said that with drugs your first high is the best and never able to be duplicated. What keeps people using drugs, despite the downfalls associated with use, is that eternal quest for that ethereal feeling that they experienced the very first time. Pleasurable activities, like exercising, sex, laughter, touch, etc. can all become dangerously addictive. Some people will do anything and everything for \'that fix".  \r\n \r\nSo what is it that makes people search for the next high, or feel good experience? Exercise, sex, laughter, and touch all produce positive effects within the body via chemicals in the brain. These chemicals are called endorphins, a mixture of the two words endogenous, meaning from within the body, and morphine, a powerful pain fighting drug that is also used and abused for recreational purposes. Endorphins are the body\'s internal pain regulators. The drug opium has been used recreationally as early in the ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian cultures. British physician, Thomas Syndenham brought opium to the public to be used for medicinal purposes around sixteen-eighty. By the end of the seventeen-twenties opium was outlawed in China, due to it\'s high level of recreational use and abuse. This led to the Opium Wars between the China and England. Opium was also used throughout the Civil War to treat battle wounds and in surgery (1).  \r\n \r\nCredit for the discovery and abilities of endorphins are given to various different people, at different times in history. In the mid nineteen-sixties Berkeley professor, Choh Li, discovered the analgesic, or pain reducing, significance of a certain pituitary hormone, which he named B-Lipotropin (2). Upon attempting to figure out why opium affected people the way that it does, scientists, Solomon H. Synder and Candace B. Pert at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Lars Tereniun of the University of Uppsala, and Eric J. Simon of the New York University School of Medicine discovered the receptor-labeling technique and stumbled upon the idea of the opiate receptor in the brain (3) These receptors are the sites upon which drugs, such as opium, morphine, and heroin, target and affect the user\'s behavior and mood. These research teams found that the opiate receptors seemed to be consolidated in the portions of the brain included in integration and perception of pain and emotions. If the body is in pain, opiates will diminish the discomfort. If the body is not in pain, a feeling of euphoria will come over the body and take the user to a different level of consciousness, the "high". Endorphins are the body\'s natural "feel good" drug.  \r\n \r\nIn nineteen seventy-five, John Hughes and Hans W. Kosterlitz of the University of Aberdeen managed to isolate peptides found occurring naturally within the brain. These peptides were called endorphins, meaning morphine from within, and were found to have pain reducing effects (4). Endorphins are now known universally as stress, or catecholamine, relieving hormones which act much like the opiate drugs opium, morphine, and heroin. When stress is detected by the brain, it sends out signals, or opiates, which bind at the receptor sites, and the pain is alleviated. Feelings of euphoria follow and soon become apparent.  \r\n \r\nEndorphins, much like the drugs that they mimic, have the phenomenon of eliciting either the fight or flight syndrome and/or the reward system, which is why abuse is possible. It is known and quite obvious that structures in the body have evolved through the decades. Evidence of the change within the brain\'s structures are apparent in the way that humans learn to adapt to situations and survive situations of pain. An endorphin rush allows an person to either stay and fight or run away, either choice quite beneficial to survival of the individual. Afterwards, endorphins also allow the person to be able to work with the pain its body is feeling and recover. These ground-breaking studies opened many doors for the scientific community to be able to study various angles of pain, depression, happiness, abuse/obsession potential, and homeostatic processes, such as eating and exercise, many angles which were previously barely understood.  \r\n \r\nThe checks and balances system of endorphins physically consists of chains of amino acids, which make up the chemical messengers known as ne          \nSEX : Several Eery Xylophones \r\n \r\n          Super Evil Xtreme          \nsex is a only thing of relaxed for man and woman, feel after sex very comfortable so sex is relax for person.          \n1)game of 0 and 1 in bed \r\n2)after working hard for long time we feel relaxed \r\n3)during these day\'s we think more about it so (if u think more u get more)  \r\n4)it\'s a nature          \nSex (well, more accurately, an orgasm) releases endorphins. Endorphins are "feel good" chemicals in your body that have a chemical structure similar to morphine. Random trivia - your body will also release endorphins during exercise (ever heard of the "runner\'s high"?) and even during laughter. Basically, people enjoy sex because it feels good. There have been studies which show there are health benefits to sex as well (look here -  Sex can be fun, but please, always be safe and use protection.          \nBecause when you have sex it releases endorphins which make you feel happy and relaxed, these endorphins are a great stress reliever. Also giving blow jobs exercises your jaw muscles an the semen helps to whiten your teeth. Sex also burns calories.

	{'answer': u'\nYou cannot obtain a green card unless you first qualify for immigration, legal permanent residency.  Student, employment, visit, and other types of visas are all temporary NON-immigration classes of visas.  Amount of time you spend in the US on any of these is irrelevant since you are only allowed into US for temporary purpose.  You are not an immigrant. \r\n \r\nAlmost all (some 90%) US immigrants are sponsored by spouse or immediate family member who is a US citizen and who earns enough to support them.  As a student visa holder, you must return to your country of citizenship immediately upon completion or termination of studies.  You are not remaining in US - finish your course in school & return home.          \nYou can apply for naturalization after holding a green card for five years.  How long it takes to get the green card varies depending on how you\'re entering the US.  Marriage is the fastest route to a green card as it doesn\'t require you to live in the US for a time on a work visa first.  You also don\'t have to have a degree and a job if you obtain your green card through marriage (although your spouse will have to have a job).  Student visas are non-immigrant and time spent in the US as a student doesn\'t count toward either a green card or citizenship.          \nSgt. Star was wrong. Yes, you can get a green card by virtue of employment or marriage. It does not take five years.  \r\n \r\nThe citizenship requirement is that after you get your green card, you have to be in the US for five years before applying.  \r\n \r\nNote--If you\'ve been in the US for five years without a green card, you are here illegally. In order to receive a green card, you\'d have to leave the country and reenter legally--after a ten-year ban.          \nthis is a bit garbled information.  \r\n \r\nYou need at least a greencard to join the US army.  \r\nYou do not get a greencard based on living in the US. Living in the US on a student visa doesn\'t count.  \r\nYou can get a greencard based on getting married to an US citizen if that citizen sponsors you and has sufficient income to do so.  \r\nAlternatively an employer can sponsor you for a greencard, but not too many do.  \r\n \r\nI would suggest going to the USCIS website and reading through the ways to get a greencard.  \r\n          \nIf living in the United States for at least 5 years would lead to a Green Card, many of the 11 million illegal aliens would be Green Card holders by now, don\'t you think? Clearly, the Sgt doesn\'t think that far, which is why he had to enlist in the Army instead of getting a real job that requires usage of the brain or skills beyond saying "Yes, Sir!" and shooting at people. \r\n \r\nAn F-1 is a non-immigrant visa. There is no path from a non-immigrant visa to permanent residency. \r\n \r\nYou would need a reason to be eligible for permanent residency, a.k.a. a Green Card. Being married to a US citizen would be one viable path, if the US citizen spouse files a petition and is a viable sponsor for Affidavit of Support purposes. Another path is a doctorate degree or an investment of $1M or more. An indirect path is via an H1-B visa, after 6 years of working in a certain position requiring an advanced university degree.          ',
	 'question': u'\n    SGT STAR: You cannot join the U.S. Army unless you are a U.S. citizen, U.S. National, or have a green card. You can only get a green card if you live in the United States for 5 years or marry a U.S. citizen. In order to move to the United States you have to get a resident card. You can obtain a resident card by first getting a job in the U.S. US Citizenship and Immigration Services ..... \r\nI asked SGT star at Goarmy.com and it tells me this ...  \r\nso If I lived in USA for 5 years can I obtain green card ...  \r\ndoes F1 ( student visa ) visa count .. beside that I am chemistry Pre pharmacy and pre Optometry  ',

So far nothing in this direction is not even planed. \r\n So people siting in here for over 20 years, some of  them pays taxes most not. Seeing parents and kids only on foto and not having any hope for change.  \r\nHaw you may wont to help them: I do not know. \r\nI do not know what you could do, but I thing as normal resident, nothing, anles you are candidate for president          \nCatholic Charities helps immigrants. If that's not quite your flavor, I suspect you can call them and ask if they know someone who does similar work with a different religious background.   \r\n \r\nI think there are people here who need help, but helping *any*one is better than just griping.  Something about lighting a candle instead of cursing the darkness?          \ni am glad that you want to help people,but i think you should start in your homeland first,we have so many people that need help and would be glad to get it so they could go back to work or maybe just to eat one meal a day.think about how many children in the us go hungry every day ,why not try to help them.

	{'answer': u"\nit would not be wise to do so? since they are being sponsored to come in the US already, more than likely? they will be turned away..a visitor visa can end up in an overstaying in the US,          \nNo. Your parents cannot enter the US as tourists once a family based petition for them is already in process. They have to wait for their family based petition to be served and use that to enter the US. \r\n \r\nFirst of all, you have to understand that a US tourist visa will be denied them at the US embassy in their/your country if they attempt to apply. They will be in the computer or data base so the consul will know that a family based petition is already in process for them. If they already have a tourist visa and would like to come in the US, they will still be inspected at the port of entry. \r\n \r\nThere can only be one way of coming into the U.S. and that is either through a tourist or immigrant visa. Not both are given. Once an immediate family based petition is filed, then that person is already disqualified for a tourist visa.  \r\n \r\nI hope that their petition will arrive soon as you are obviously missing them. Best of luck to your family.          \nIf they apply for a tourist visa, they will be denied. If they already have a multiple entry visa, they will not have a problem (technically they are not supposed to enter on a tourist visa, but in practice they can)          \nI believe that there'll be a chance for them to come as visitor, as long as they are stable financially. Meaning to say, they have a certain amount of money show money. Why don't you seek the advice of immigration lawyer instead?          \nIf you parents are in the middle of the sponsor process, they are not allowed to enter to US until after the petition is approved.  Plus when they find out they have one in process, their visitor visa will be denied.          \nThat is totally under discretion of Immigration Officer at the airport, if they already have Visitors visa. If they have to apply one, the approval of visa is totally under the discretion of Consular officer at US Embassy.  \r\n \r\nAlso, when the interview is scheduled, they must in present at US Embassy in Chennai. They cannot change their process in US.          ",

Besides there is a large number of people out there that can read and wtrite Spanish correctly, but on messages or on line they rather do it sloppy because it is easier and quicker (faster). \r\nI am Puerto Rican and I speak, write, understand Spanish and English fluently and correctly. \r\nOK, I\'m not waisting my time translating for you because I feel it is not worth it. \r\nLearn to love people for what they really are, not for the way the speak, write or spell. \r\nAre you perfect?

	{'answer': u"\nApply for them?          \nGoing to the Embassy and Applying for them          \nTo immigrate, you must have an immediate blood relative (parent, sibling, or adult child over 21) who is a US citizen and who has sufficient income & assets to guarantee your support sponsor you.  If their petition is approved, you must remain in your country waiting in line until there is an available visa for you.  Lots of people are ahead of you in line, and waits can be over 20 years from some countries. Only after you are admitted to the US as a legal immigrant can you then apply for your green card. \r\n \r\nVisas: so many categories and qualifications that you need to read the USCIS website thoroughly to see if you qualify for anything.          \nSure, have a job that is in a critical shortage area that we can't fill with our current workforce. Otherwise, apply to and attend school here. It seems like you speak English, so it shouldn't be that much of a problem. I don't know what your life situation is, so I can't provide more specific information.          \nMarry me? lol \r\nYou can apply for it from internet. \r\nI think David did a good job.          \nDavid says it all.          \nFor a green card, married a US Citizen and make sure it's for love. \r\nIf you have a direct family member in the US (mom, dad, brother or sister) they can sponsor to bring you to the US \r\nJust for visas, find a job that will sponsor you on a working visa. Not many jobs are willing to do that. \r\nOr you could go to school here, apply for a school  and if you get accepted, student visa.          \n \r\n \r\n          \nI watched in few movies ,about this green card.Let me tell you what they did to get one.They stayed as couples ,though they were only friends.And they got green card.I think you should google it to find out the condition behind it. \r\n \r\nDon't worry there are many ways to take lots of money from this world...My only regret is that ,I belong to such a country, and am born as female...your a boy, go a head give yourself a try..

	{'answer': u'\nno he cant, there is punishment but certainly no beating allowed.          \nThank you Maria sister, for trying to show them...I wish insha\'allah they will open their minds a bit more about Islam. big hug for you :)          \nwhen a person use his finger to make us see the point,we dont see the moon, instead we look at the finger,and discuss argue about the finger,we miss all ,may allah protect us          \nPlease read the quoted Ayah again. I do not find that it is addressed to \'husbands\' and gives them an authority over \'wives\' to inflict a punishment for very objectionable behavior on the part of married women in society. for \'beat them\' the Arabic word is \'Zaraba\'. It has meanings other than \'beating\'. This Ayah , hence, is a theological advice to Theologians.          \nI read it in hindi so translator translates the last wordings " beat them but no bleeding or no bone breaking " .. that is exceptional case .. nobody is doing such things now days. better to sit and understand each other if both are educated and know how to respect others. but illitrates no other source i think.          \nThank you sis, for trying to explain to them the truth. May Allah (SWT) reward you, Insha\'Allah. \r\nThe least they can do is try to understand, if not then at least respect it.  \r\n=)          \nThat is not cool.          \nThere is this obedience thing that I find a bit disturbing - okay, I get the deal that the husband protects his wife, and that the wife should be modest and listen to her husband, it\'s a given in any adult relationship that partners listen to each other and consider each other\'s wishes. But adding obedience into the mix suggests that the wife is little better than a child, and also suggests that there is an inequality in the relationship.  \r\n \r\nAs regards beating your wife for disobedience - sorry lads. I don\'t condone beating anybody when you\'re annoyed with them, because you\'re annoyed with them. Then chances are you\'ll hit harder than you mean to, which means that there is a greater likelihood of injuring them.          \nIt Still allows them to beat there wives.. If they disobey them.. And excuse me.. i dont need no man to protect me.. what is it trying to say that am weak and my man is responsible for me.. Ain\'t i am my own person.. LIKE AM SOME KIND OF ANIMAL WHO NEEDS A MAN FOR PROTECTION.. i can protect my self thank you.. i aint no child          \nto beat a woman is cowardly,and it shore ain\'t protecting them          \nSince according to Islam any hitting is to leave no blemish then I don\'t consider that to be beating.  However, I don\'t think any man has any right to lay his hands on a woman, whether she is his wife or not, as a means of disciplining her.  That is treating her as property rather than as a life partner.          \ndon\'t say that there r soft beatings:P, well, how whould a woman know what unfaithfull is if she\'s not even allowd to enter a muslim church, and I\'m a western ( whell European) and I\'m not a sex object:P, many times women got killed because they spent time with a man( who is not a part of the family) and didn\'t discuss this with the family in the same room( I repeat, they only spent time). She was killed by a member of her family, whatever the caes is women shoudn\'t be ruled by men and they should get the respect that they also can go to church          \nThere is no doubt that Islam advocates "beating" of the wife after the prior two steps. But what most people are ignorant of, or tend to ignore, is the Hadeeth whereby the Prophet (S) explained to the Companions how to carry this out. He took a miswak and struck it; that was it. \r\n \r\nBut the truth is, the burden is upon the husband it maintain a good relationship with his wife. I have a good friend, who is really good to his wife. One day, driving home with his wife he was pretty irritated. He pulled the gear shift hard, and just because of that, since his wife never saw him angry before, she began crying. \r\nHe achieved that level of protection as stated in the verse.          \nwell he shouldnt. remember when the prophet said that girls should be treated equally? i dont see men as anything more special then women. also, if they are in the US, they can get arested for that          \nIn Sean Connery-lam, men can hit their wives, preferably with an open hand, if the situation merits it. \n \nTo all of you guys patting yourselves on the backs, who gives a damn?          \nCos Mohammed was a man \n \nNuff said \n \nJohn          ',
	 'question': u"\n    MANY NON-BELIEVERS ASK THIS QUESTION JUST BY QUOTING THE RELATED LINES AND IGNORE THE REST OF THE VERSE. READ IT AND UNDERSTAND IT. \r\n \r\nAllaah Says (what means): {Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband's absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband's property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great.} [Quran 4:34]. \r\nThe interpretation of this verse is that Allaah gave men the duty of protecting, helping and supporting women; this means that a man is responsible for the protection,  ",

	{'answer': u'\nYou will have to apply to immigration. All the info you need is here:  \r\n \r\nGood luck with that!          \nyou can\'t legally get work here although as a British citizen, no visa is required for you to visit. \r\n \r\nAmerican immigration is permitted in only limited ways: \r\n \r\n1.  essential skills after employer fails to find Americans to do the work. \r\n2.  second and third world immigrants via the \'lottery\' \r\n3.  family of current permanent residents and citizens. \r\n \r\nOrdinary citizens of first world countries who do not fall into groups one or three are NOT wanted in America.          \nYou do not appear to have any sort of grounds or qualifications for any kind of visa except a tourist visa (Visa Waiver Program if you are UK citizen).  That limits the length of your stay.  It also eliminates any possibility of working, residing, etc.  You sightsee & go home.  No way can you "move" to the US. \r\n \r\nYou may be required to prove you have sufficient funds for all the typical tourist expenses - round-trip tickets, hotels, restaurant meals, sightseeing, ground transportation, etc.  As a tourist in NYC, it is very easy to blow through $500 a day!  Hotels are pretty expensive (and beware the cheap ones!).  Even McDonald\'s charges higher prices in Manhattan than elsewhere in the US! \r\n \r\nAnd expect them to ask about your job back home and your accrued vacation time & assigned dates so you are sure to return to work on time.  In other words, they want to ensure you have ample incentive to get your butt back into the UK promptly.          \nbased off of what you said then you have ZERO chance of getting a visa.......for the most part you can only come from the UK with either a marriage visa or a work sponsored visa............and for the work one you have got to hold a high end degree. \r\n \r\nAs a brit living here some things are better but there are very few safety nets and NONE for legal immigrants to be honest........... \r\n \r\nI also take it you have NOT lived in New York, this is not a cheap place nor is it that great to live in.          \nHey folks, how do British actors and comedians come work here?

	{'answer': u'\nyou hit the nail on the head in your additional... \r\n \r\nI think tolerance begins where your rights end... \r\n \r\nanything that does not infringe on your rights or the rights of others should be tolerated.. \r\n \r\nanything that does infringe on your rights or the rights of others should NOT be tolerated...          \nBefore I even clicked on your question I was thinking of typing an answer that acceptance is what is needed. \r\n \r\nWe need to learn to accept that other people are different from us. \r\n \r\nOnce we do that the planet will be peaceful. \r\n \r\nAddition: We cannot have right and wrong in a world of acceptance but sadly such a world will never exist because some people will be unable to stop abusing others.          \nTolerance is not putting up with what disgusts you per say \r\n \r\nbut if you tolerate what you do not like...you learn more about it \r\n \r\nafter learning about it...you understand it and no longer hate it \r\n \r\npeople can be victims of learned hatred..by teaching these people to be tolerant..we can show them that what they learned was unacceptable is just different and not necessarily wrong...          \nGood speech, ever think in running for political office?          \nI don\'t think there is much tolerance in this world.  If there was it wouldn\'t be such a hell hole for so many people.  People should be more tolerant.  It would promote peace instead of war.          \nYou are right, but some things we\'ll never understand. That\'s when tolerance is important. Tolerance can get you through until understanding takes place. You know what I mean? Tolerance keeps our mind open to understanding.          \nWell said! \r\n \r\n~~~~~~ \r\nNeo, it\'s better to be wise about not making assumptions about my beliefs. You couldn\'t be further from what I believe and what my religion states.          \nThe problem is that most people belong to an abrahamic religion. In those religions (jews, christians, muslims)... each considers itself to be God\'s true followers, and everyone else is evil. \r\n \r\nAgain, note: most people on the planet are of an abrahamic religion. The best you can do with an abrahamic religion is tell their followers - be tolerant! There is no "just understand me"... the only thing they can understand is that they\'re right, and everyone else is evil for rejecting their religion. \r\n \r\nEDIT: Actually the jews are probably the most "tolerant" of the 3... maybe that\'s why they\'re so few in number.          \nI think it\'s a matter of semantics.  What you describe as acceptance, I consider tolerance.  Acceptance would be if I were to engage or participate in other beliefs or activities, in my opinion.          \nTolerance and acceptance are two different things. We don\'t need to accept everything that\'s wrong and not to anything about it, but we need to be tolerant towards others and their beliefs...          \nTolerance is what holds a civilized society together. Without it everything falls apart. It is different from acceptance in that we don\'t have to agree all the time. Look at our governments for example. We don\'t always like what they do but we wait until we can vote, we don\'t break up into various camps and go to war. That is tolerance and patience.          \nI think you\'re exactly right, but that\'s a little bit utopian, thinking that too many people are going to take the time to understand the people around them.  I have encountered SOME (note that word "some") people who are hard pressed to read even their cereal boxes first thing in the morning, never mind the beliefs of others.  They won\'t be interested enough to do that. \r\n \r\nSo "tolerance" is the next most desirable thing to hope for.  No one can argue with the logic that "if you don\'t like it, fine, but don\'t try to stop others from living their lives the way they see fit."          \n"Tolerance would imply that you\'re putting up with something you dislike or disagree with" \r\n \r\nYes.  For example Gay sex which I find foul and disgusting even to think of.  Yet I "tolerate it".  Why?  Because it is not my bottom and it\'s none of my business.   \r\n \r\nI find the arguments for tolerance based on "understanding" or subjectivity dangerous.  They imply that if a particular moral is not subjective or if you cannot "understand" the behaviour you have a right to put an end to it.  You do not, you do not have a right to interfere in others lives.   \r\n \r\nWhat we need to get through to people is not "truly understanding our fellow planet-dwellers" but respect.  Each person owns his or herself and, understand it or not, people must respect what they do with their own property.          \nI think people say they are tollerant because it is the in thing.  \r\nThey do it to make themself feel better and how they are perceived towards others. \r\n  \r\nPeople get confused, some say they are tollerent and try to be even towards extremist muslims? But you ask them to listen and except the beliefs of the KKK there is a different story.  \r\n \r\nWhite pride and power groups are the only groups not tollerated.  \r\n \r\nI seen a black panther march, all these white people were cheering at the blacks saying we need to exterminate whites, white man must be eradicated from the earth. I couldn\'t belive my ears? I thought are you dumb? you are supporting someone who wants genocide on your race? \r\n \r\nAnd at a white pride rally they were all booed when they said we should not be in the war, we should buy american, we need to go back to family values, hard working americans are loosing their jobs to illegal immigrants. \r\n \r\nI guess being tollerent would be good as being blinded by hate, made these people not even listen what the White pride group said. And i know most of them would of agreed if they were not blinded by the  pre conceived notions of the group they had. And as for the black panthers, People were blinded by being seen to support minorities and not actually listening to the msg.  \r\nI cant be tollerent of silly people,but i will try ;)          \nI never though tof it that way, but I like it.          \nI think G 72 hit it square-on.  You have to be willing to tolerate difference before you can attain understanding and acceptance of it. \r\n \r\nI think that a lot of intolerance comes from unfamiliarity.  But a lot of unfamiliarity is not going to go away overnight.          \nLets take a look at homosexuality. Many Christians simply cannot be acceptant due to their religious views. If there would at least be tolerance then there might be progress.  Acceptance is like saying you agree with something but tolerance is like saying I don\'t agree but I\'m not going to attack you. There\'s things I don\'t personally agree with but I tolerate becuase there are times when I have to tell myself \'who am I to tell others how to live their lives\'. Does that make sense? If not I\'m sorry, I\'m really really tired...          ',
	 'question': u"\n    I have never been once to preach tolerance necessarily. Tolerance would imply that you're putting up with something you dislike or disagree with.

	{'answer': u'\nFirst you have to understand that their inability to feel guilty or ashamed has nothing to do with you. \r\nThen only you understand why you are hurt, they can not feel what you are feeling. \r\nI hope you have told them, that is a must. \r\nThose feelings, released into the air, or given away, either to them or just spoken out loud, takes them from within you. \r\nBe them in your mind just for awhile. Realize all their life\'s situations that could make them who they are, what could make them act or speak or think the way they do? If you find the hidden reason\'s, then you must find compassion especially if this person has been terribly hurt themselves.          \nEasier said than done, but I think it\'s about making peace with the situation for your own peace of mind, completely distinct from where the other person is at.  Perhaps it will help to find a harmless way of expressing your anger - such as by digging the garden, or doing martial arts, or perhaps finding a creative outlet (for example, writing your feelings down in a journal, or painting them).  These, and the passage of time, will ease your feelings.          \nForgiveness is not for the benefit of the forgiven, but for those who forgive.  When you forgive, you are saying that you no longer carry the burden of worrying about what people did to you.  Worrying about the hurt people did to you is a burden to YOU, it may not be to them.  Letting them know that you forgive is a way of telling them that they cannot hurt you because you refuse to let what they do keep you down or hold you back, which is what mulling over the hurt does to you.  In Indian philosophy, that is what is meant by karma.          \nI\'m in a situation like that right now.  Practice makes it easier. I\'m not being rude here.  I mean it.  I\'m not forgiving for them, I\'m forgiving for ME.  So I can sleep at night.  So I don\'t carry bitterness and resentment around.  So I\'m in control of my emotions not the other way around.  So they don\'t have rent free space in my mind.   So I am free to be love in action. \r\nIf I\'m not forgiving when I need to be, then I\'m as much a part of the problem as this person is right now who gleefully looks for ways to poke and prod at me and knows just how to get at my tender spots.  \r\nThanks for the Q.  I feel a whole lot better that I am not the only one struggling with this right at this moment.  And I\'m able in this moment to let it go and forgive it.  \r\nMy stomach thanks you, the knot is gone.  My heart thanks you, now I can just extend love into the situation. \r\nAnd you get a star.  :)  Hope this helps.  Blessings.          \nIt is important to remember that "Forgiveness" only takes one person - you. It\'s reconciliation that would take two. I personally am unable to ignore the hurt and anger when someone hurts me. Emotionally you have to go through that and sometimes it takes a bit longer for my heart to catch up with my mind. Intellectually I\'ll know that forgiveness sets me free but emotionally I am wounded. For me it also depends on who has hurt me. I had a very dear friend betray me and I was hurt. I made several attempts to rectify these feelings but she kept doing the same thing over and over again never taking responsibility for her behavior and didn\'t seem to care. She had no remorse for the hurt she caused.  I finally had to realize that I had been avoiding dealing with the loss of the friendship. Once I allowed myself to let go of the relationship I was also able to forgive. We are not friends but I am free from the woundedness that she created. I hope this is helpful and that you will feel the internal freedom of forgiveness in your situation.          \nif these \'actions\' have happened in the past , and still continue --- then you seriously need to consider your assocciation with them . in other words you need to ditch them and get on with your life and also make new friends .good luck .          \nDo they know they hurt you? if so, it may be a matter of respect.  It IS OK to get angry, the trick is channeling the anger to positive results.  Being assertive is a way to filter those elements off your life & that\'s ok.          \nStop being so worried over what is going on in their mind and just get on with your own life. This is your personal journey leave how he feels for him to sort out, he/she is on their own journey.  Just sort out your own feelings without expecting anything from the other person.  If you don\'t want to forgive them then don\'t, you don\'t owe them anything.          \nWell, I would ignore them... \r\nDon\'t make it your responsibility to forgive them unless they absolutely need to be a good part of your life or heart. \r\n \r\nTaking on the burdens of the world is not good for your heart and esteem, especially if they hurt you again and again. I would just shut off and find better. Ignore them. They are not worth your attention. Forgive yourself, they are not your responsibility.          \nIt would probably be good to accept the fact that they simply don\'t know what love is and so, its best not to take their actions too personal. It might be best to avoid contacting them whilst that would only make it easier to re-live the pain.However, dont make them your enemy or hold any animosity in your heart towards them. You should also not let this consume your thoughts or prevent you from doing what needs to be done. Perhaps you can occupy yourself in doing things that you love and not let this hurt your esteem. Just remember that time is a healer. \r\nGod bless!          \nThere are people who don\'t have feelings for other people.  They will rarely, if ever, apolgize for their behavior.  I think it more rational to understand this, rather than to keep expecting everybody to apologize.  You only feel put-upon and hurt and end up being the only one who feels bad.  Understanding, however, that this kind of person rarely, if ever changes, you don\'t expect considerate behavior from him/her, and therefore, go your own way if you choose!  It might be good if you checked your own feelings out--to see if maybe you are a bit more sensitive to others\' behaviors than it is healthy to be.          \nYou don\'t forgive people like that for your benefit...It is all about you.  The less you care, the less a toll it takes on you.  I of all the people who answer this question know this well...It is hard Kumara - I am not saying it is not - It is not even a fast process...but you have a choice.  You can either live with all that hate eating your beautiful soul alive or learn to forgive... \r\nGood luck.          \nYou don\'t forgive for the person you are forgiving, you forgive for yourself.  Holding a grudge against anybody for any length of time, does nothing but bring negative energy into your life, and negative energy begets negative experiences.  If you don\'t forgive, then you are giving that person control over your emotions and your life.  *sm*          \nThats a hard one, but you have to realize that the act of forgiving is actually for your benefit and not for theirs. You will be the on that benefits from forgiving them.........if you are able to see it from this stand point, it really doesn\'t matter how they react at all. \r\nHate or resentment or feelings of sadness that another cannot "fess" up to their wrong doing, is in essence only hurting them, not you. In forgiving them, you will free yourself up. \r\nThis is something my mother told me, and it has stood the test of time: \r\n         "Hate does more to vessel in which it is stored than unto the vessel upon which it is poured"...............(not that you necessarily hate the person, but you get the message I\'m trying to send) \r\nIf you continue to feel angry towards this person, do you think it matters to them? It doesn\'t.  It only HURTS you. \r\nSome people never, ever, confess, or apologize, I have a step-mother who treated me terribly as a child, she\'s still my step mother, and has never acknowledged any wrong doing. \r\nAll I can do is pity her, and the fact that she has not yet reached the level of emotional growth that would allow her to accept responsibility and apologize......that\'s it\'s, I just have to let go, otherwise, I hurt me, and frankly it\'s just not worth it! \r\nMake it about you and your need for peace in your life, you\'ll be a happier person......and if this someone continues to hurt you, perhaps you should consider avoiding contact with him or her, or just cutting off the relationship all together? I guess it depends on weather the person is a family member or someone you have to see on a regular basis. \r\n....and remember "forgiveness" is not just one final act, it is a continuous effort, those feelings may rise back up again, and you will have to start back over again, not always, but just sometimes...... \r\nPeace, \r\nmybelle          \nForgiving is more about ridding yourself of the free rent the hurt is enjoying inside your head than it is about bestowing grace upon the hopeless sinner. \r\n \r\nTherefore, you can just choose to forgive for your own peace of mind and you don\'t even have to tell anybody about your decision.          \nI have no answer apart from time \r\nTime they will perhaps feel bad \r\nJust stay distant \r\nDon\'t get in their way if they think they\'re right but don\'t let them win either \r\nStay away for a bit and they should be ok \r\nMy sister is like this \r\nShe really does not feel no regret after argument like she does not care, yet I think she cannot help this (?) \r\nI don\'t know.............          \nThe ball is in your court.  Do forgive them.  You don\'t have to even  inform them that you have.  Just treat them normally (that might cause them to have  little humility & remorse). You will be teaching by example & will be an inspiration to all. \r\n \r\nMost of all you\'ll have peace.          \nIf you harbor resentments, it remains with you.  I f you let go and forgive them, it is gone.  So they no longer control you. \r\n \r\nI do not know how religious you are, but for me, what works is saying the "Our Father" and when it comes to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, I imagine their face at that moment.  I want to be forgiven my sins and wrong doings, so I forgive even if they acted like you described.          \nWell the best thing for you to do is tell them about it and i know its hard because they don\'t feel bad at all for what they did/said but it usually works if you tell them your feelings. \r\n \r\namber!* \r\nhope i helped=)          \nOnce you forgive them, the burden of the pain is off you. You don\'t think so for awhile, but gradually, the heavy soul lightens up, because a grudge remembered re-enacts the crime over and over again. You don\'t forgive them for their sake, you forgive them for YOUR sake...Karma (hmmm, a lot like your name) is the great equalizer, and will catch up with them....          \nI admit that, to me, forgiving is a very difficult thing to do. Especially when the person that did the bad thing is a person who matters so much to you, a very special and very important person.          \nForgiveness just belong to God. he is the only one who can forgive people actions. \r\n \r\nYou can forget or try to forget (that help the most of people) \r\n \r\nor you can listen to this. \r\n \r\n \r\nthat always help.          \nA person you described is your basic psychopath.  It could be treated, but I suggest you do research to get a better understanding.  Tony Soprano is a classic example.          \nIt doesn\'t matter if the offender has remorse. Forgiveness is the the gift that you give to yourself. The act of forgiving someone allows YOU to let go of the hurt and negative feelings. What the offender chooses to do about it is up to them.          \nwell first you put a little whip cream on your naughty part!! Then you start to rub it softly, then you start moaning and breathing really loud then your just c.u.m all over the place and you will be happy again!!!          \nI know that it is hard to forgive, butt all you have to do is pray to God and ask to help you and and by forgiving them is being alot better than them.          \nLike everyone has said yes you must forgive, and as you ask how? Well first you must confront the person, tell them what they did to offend you, and you did not appreciate it and that it really hurt you. Give them the opportunity to respond. Most of time if they did/said something bad their response will be something like "who me, what did I do?" We all know the type. Anyway if that\'s the case just say well I guess maybe I should have known better than to expect remorse from you, because if so you may not have done thus and so to start. This is not meant in a mean way but merely explaining your feelings. So from here you\'ve done your part leave it at that, and leave them out of your life, though do pray for them, and also ask God to guide you in your own life. Remember you are not responsible for others actions, nor can you control them, but rather you can only control yourself and your actions!          \nAlot of times, it\'s a good thing to be angry. It helps you from making the same mistakes by trusting the same people. Truth is, if someone doesn\'t ask for forgiveness, why should you give it to them.          \nThis is an excellent question that many people have. In order to forgive others, who seem to show no remorse for their actions, you must ask yourself why you wish to forgive them. In most cases, it is to find peace with yourself, or at least that should be the reason. You must stop thinking of holding a grudge as having power over the other person, because in reality, it is their power over you. You obsess over whether or not you should forgive this person, when in reality, they don\'t really care. So the only person you not forgiving them is affecting is you. Once, you realize this, you can start forgiving because it lifts a weight off of your shoulders, not necessarily the person\'s shoulders you are forgiving.          ',

	{'answer': u'\nDr. Octagonecologyst? \n \nWhatever album you consider to be the most "abstract". \nThe Cold Vein\'s production fits that bill...Deltron 3030 is another. \nExactly what is your reason for God Loves Ugly? If that\'s your favorite Atmosphere album \nthen sure.  \nPersonally my favorite is When Life Gives You Lemons...but that is their most \npopular and maybe least "underground" album.  \nAlso their production style changed on that album, and Slug\'s lyrical  \ncontent changed also. More storytelling, instead of personal views. \nGod Loves Ugly is probably Atmosphere at their rawest, kinda of a depressing album. \n \n \nSo I guess that may be your reason.  \nI think the aforementioned Deltron and The Cold Vein deserve a spot,  \nso it\'s tought to say, trying to cover all the aspects \nof underground hip hop here.  \n \nI like the list as it is, actually. \n \nEDIT [2]: \n \nFuncrusher Plus represents probably the most successful independent hip hop \nlabel, Rawkus, and nothing was straightforward. One of the most unique \nalbums, and one of the deepest. Epitomizes how hip hop is so much denser than other \ngenres. I think Innercity Griots was a better album than To Whom it May Concern. \n \nThen you also have to represent the aspect of the underground that is kind of  \nattacking what\'s wrong with hip hop nowadays.

Masters of the Universe could do the same thing. \n \nA Prince among Thieves > A Piece of Strange \n \n@Trylemma: What was the influence of Blazing Arrow? \n \nIf Donuts is selected then you have a debate about instrumental hip hop albums \n \nOkay, I see, I see \n \nNo further questions          \nI agree with most of those choices, I\'d probably add \'The Best Part\' by J-Live and \'Masters of the Universe\' by Binary Star          \nMost Important "Underground" Hip Hop Albums Of All Time..... hmmm. If you wouldn\'t have said MOST important, it would have been easier to write down ten, but one that comes to mind is the Geto Boys 1991 album called We Can\'t Be Stopped. It\'s the album that put Texas on the map along with the Rap-A-Lot record label. This album is underground for it not getting massive exposure on the radio for its explicit-heavy-lyrical content, except for the song Mind Playing Tricks on Me and yet did very well. Keep in mind this is the early 90\'s where the internet did not exist to get massive publicity to the whole world, but they managed to get props. They got some exposure, but very less comparing to groups like ATCQ and so on.... \n \n@ Try... Wait so you\'re making a top ten only.... Dayum I thought you wanted to add to those. Anyway kinda hard though but I\'ll say Below The Heavens - Blu & Exile because it\'s a relatively recent album to have made a GREAT impact yet. It\'s good but not top ten worthy for now. On another note Funcrusher Plus is a must on the list in my opinion because it encapsulated what NY underground hip-hop was at the time and before that there wasn\'t any album that can be truly considered abstract prior to that, specially on lyrics. It redefined a new era of underground hip-hop.... \n \n \nGood post mayne. The section needs more of this....          \nI would put Dr. Octagon in instead of Deltron.  It was doing all the same stuff 4 years earlier. I would have Quality Control instead of Blazing Arrow, too.  I know you\'re never going to pull a Blackalicious album off a list, though. \n \nI don\'t know how I feel about APOS being on a list of "most important."  Not sure what I\'d put on instead.  Maybe Mystic Stylez? \n \nBlack Star is only borderline underground. I like the idea of an Organized Konfusion album here. \n \nCritical Beatdown is another one to consider. \n \nOG Loc makes a valid point about including both Cold Vein and Funcrusher. \n \nNot trying to say Deltron isn\'t influential, but I\'d have a hard time including both Deltron and Dr. Octagon on a list like this and, honestly, I think without Dr. Octagon there is no Deltron. \n \nI guess I\'m kind of reading (or misreading)  "most important" as "most influential."  Which is why I think Mystic Stylez deserves a spot.  I mean, as a mid-90\'s southern album, it scores automatic influence points, it\'s also one of the earliest notable horrorcore albums, and launched Three 6.  Who effectively popularized crunk and trap by themselves.  For better or worse, Mystic Stylez is a hugely influential album.  I would definitely say more so than APOS, Below the Heavens or Blazing Arrow.          \nSolid list. Masters Of The Universe is a must though....and I think Scorpion Circles is another (stan but whatever). And something by J-Live too is a must in reality. What to take off? I\'ll get hate for this, but A Piece Of Strange, it wouldn\'t make my top 20 underground albums, if we\'re talking concept albums there are plenty to replace it. A Prince Among Thieves for example....And is it necessary to have both The Cold Vein and Funcrusher Plus? Funcrusher is essential for obvious reasons and I hate to throw off The Cold Vein but both on the same list....eh I don\'t know.....Imaginarium by L*Roneous too should be on it....and something like Koolmotor or Fantastic Vol. 2 for dopeasfuck production. All suggestions though..... \n \nEDIT: Just to add on something, it\'s nearly necessary to have something by Dilla on this sorta list....you know?? \n \nEDIT2: Lol yah I kinda forgot about essential when dropping Scorpion Circles....I\'m still feeling strongly about APAT. For the concept, skits...I think it\'s been a bigger influence than APOS but whatever. What about Violent By Design by JMT?? I haven\'t seen it mentioned and is at least worth considering...and something in the whole political/conspiracy field....Lets Get Free, The 911 Report....or hell even Rev Vol. 2? Again suggestions... \n \nOn a lighter note, props for this thread. By far the best thread in months.... \n \nEDIT3: I\'m biased towards Innercity Griots too but I think it is essential. If not definitely, some Project Blowed album, most likely something by Acey...and Blazing Arrow is another essential. In regards to The Unseen I don\'t know...you\'ve got Madvillainy there for Stones Throw and if you\'re throwing in Donuts too...it\'d be either Donuts or The Unseen but the Dilla factor is enormous really.... Another consideration, The Ugly Truth by Prolyphic & Reanimator. The whole emo wave? Maybe replacing APOS...Oh and one that just struck me is 93 Til Infinity....          \nI\'m not sure if this album actually counts but what about Soul Food by Goodie Mob?          \nOff the top of my head i can think of: \r\n \r\nBlack On Both Sides- Mos Def \r\nEnter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)- Wu-Tang Clan \r\nThe Infamous- Mobb Deep \r\n \r\nHope this helped!          \nEver considered the uk underground scene?. They are quite good actually, Squeeks, Joe black, Benny banks etc. All from the Islington section of london. http://www.ukrapmusic.com/mixtapes/947-squeeks-welcome-to-the-neighbourhood          ',
	 'question': u'\n    I don\'t know what "underground" means. You could come up with 20 different definitions for 20 different cases. There are tons of artists with major deals who most people would consider "underground". There are people who have been on MTV and on FM radio who are also considered "underground". There are people who have never been on MTV or on FM radio who have more money and are more famous than people with major deals. Distribution varies. The internet is now really the only "stream" that matters. I don\'t really know what "important" means either. Regardless, drop the 10 albums you think might fit some case... \r\n \r\nHere\'s 10 I just thought up of (I\'ll do a revised list later with ya\'lls help) \r\n \r\nA Piece of Strange - Cunninlynguists \r\nBelow The Heavens - Blu & Exile \r\nBlack Star - Black Star \r\nBlazing Arrow - Blackalicious \r\nDeltron 3030 - Deltron 3030 \r\nFuncrusher Plus - Company Flow \r\nGod Loves Ugly - Atmosphere \r\nInnercity Griots - Freestyle Fellowship \r\nMadvilliany - Madvillain \r\nThe Cold Vein - Cannibal Ox  ',

	{'answer': u'\nnop never bought vinyl          \nI\'m only 15 and my parent\'s record player doesn\'t work, so I don\'t own any, but my parents do and we recently acquired my late grandma\'s record player, so we\'ve been listening a bit again - nothing new, mainly \'60s music.          \nBack in the good ol days I was prone to tap my feet listening to a bit of Abba... \r\n \r\nBetter times better mmmhijovn... \r\n \r\n*puts back in false teeth* \r\n \r\nNow where was I...          \nI have loads of vinyl...yea im old.  I dont remember last one i bought.  First was Deguello by ZZ Top and McCartney II by ..well duh.          \nLast week. \r\nRamones- Rocket To Russia.          \nI picked up 4 Hall and Oates albums today at a yard sale.  \r\n Can\'t you tell? \r\n One is still in the original plastic wrapper and will never be opened. \r\n Another one has Daryl Halls autograph. \r\n I will check on the authenticity of it later. All for 5 dollars.          \nI have no clue how many albums I had at last count - somewhere close to a thousand.  I cleaned them everytime I played them and used a zerostat to get rid of static.  Almost all were pristine.  Many rare and collectible - although I would never sell them.  I had a fire and my house was looted - they were all stolen.  My heart is still broken over it.... \r\n.          \nI love vinyl! \r\nLast one I bought was... 15 45\'s about a week ago. \r\n \r\nMost of the records I have are from my mom though. She had a bunch. Some of them accidentally got thrown away during construction  :c \r\nBut I DO have this really cool Beatles picture disc, it\'s one of only a thousand.          \nI have over 100 LP\'s and I think the last one I bought may have been Pink Floyd "The Wall" or Boston "Afterburner"          \nToday, I bought MGMT\'s "Time To Pretend" on vinyl (new) from the local record store. Last week, I bought OK Computer (new, remastered) for $30. Last month, I bought 100 used vinyls for $60 (bands like The Beatles, Beach Boys, Stones, Police).          \ni still have T- Bone \'N\' Weasel \r\nmyself          \nTwo - First one was Joan Baez - Battle Hymn of the Republic (in Mono!!)
